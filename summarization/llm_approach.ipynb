       "    'paragraphs': 'Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based autonomous agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] , ranging from scientific research and code generation to interactive web navigation and data analysis. A key enabler of these capabilities is tool-augmented reasoning, where agents leverage external tools such as search engines, calculators, code interpreters, and APIs to extend their problem-solving capacity beyond the inherent limitations of parametric knowledge.\\nCurrent approaches to tool-augmented reasoning can be broadly categorized into two paradigms: multi-agent systems (MAS) and tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) models. Multi-agent frameworks orchestrate multiple specialized agents with distinct roles and tool sets to collaboratively solve complex tasks. These systems have shown impressive performance on benchmarks requiring sophisticated workflows, such as software development and scientific research. However, they suffer from critical limitations: (1) high computational overhead due to redundant inter-agent communication and complex orchestration mechanisms; (2) inability to learn from data, as the underlying LLMs are not specifically trained for multi-agent coordination; and (3) reliance on prompt engineering rather than native model capabilities to achieve multi-turn, multi-tool workflows.\\nIn contrast, Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) models represent an emerging paradigm that explicitly trains LLMs to incorporate tool usage into their reasoning process. Recent work such as Search-R1 [ 7 ] and WebThinker [ 5 ] has demonstrated that end-to-end training of models to invoke tools (e.g., <search> functions) at appropriate reasoning steps significantly outperforms prompt-engineered approaches. The TIR framework naturally aligns with the ReAct paradigm [ 4 ] , enabling models to follow a “think-act-observe” pipeline in an end-to-end manner. However, existing TIR methods are fundamentally limited to sequential reasoning trajectories. They execute one action at a time and thus fail to exploit opportunities for parallel tool execution when sub-tasks are independent.\\nTo address these limitations, we introduce Graph-based Agent Planning Paradigm (GAP), a novel training paradigm that enables LLM-based agents to perform dependency-aware planning through explicit graph-based reasoning. Our key insight is that by training models to construct and reason over task dependency graphs, they acquire the capability to autonomously determine optimal execution strategies, thereby executing independent tools in parallel when possible and sequential ones when necessary. This approach combines the efficiency and learnability of TIR models with the expressive power of multi-agent coordination, without the overhead of actual multi-agent orchestration.\\nOur main contributions are:\\nWe introduce GAP, a novel training paradigm for agent foundation models that incorporates dependency-aware task planning, enabling dynamic parallel and serial tool execution. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly train LLMs for graph-based reasoning over task dependencies in tool-augmented settings.\\nWe design and curate a high-quality dataset of 7,000 graph-based planning traces from the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark, using GPT-4o to synthesize dependency-aware reasoning trajectories. We apply a rigorous filter mechanism, ensuring that training data emphasize dependency modeling.\\nWe demonstrate through extensive experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks that GAP achieves a 0.9% average performance improvement on multi-hop reasoning tasks over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, our method significantly enhances efficiency by reducing interaction turns by up to 33.4%, while decreasing response length by 24.9% and maintaining robust generalization to out-of-domain datasets.\\nOur work establishes graph-based dependency modeling as a critical direction for developing more efficient autonomous agents, bridging the gap between sequential TIR models and complex multi-agent coordination. Through extensive experiments on MHQA, we demonstrate that GAP achieves significant improvements over traditional ReAct baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.',\n",

Figure ˜ 1 presents the complete GAP reasoning workflow, integrating task decomposition, graph construction, and adaptive execution.\\nWe consider a task-solving scenario where an agent must answer a complex query q q by leveraging a set of external tools 𝒯 = { t 1 , t 2 , … , t n } \\\\mathcal{T}=\\\\{t_{1},t_{2},\\\\ldots,t_{n}\\\\} .

This approach is inspired by the multi-agent distillation framework proposed by Chain-of-Agents [ 11 ] . Starting with the Natural Questions (NQ) [ 12 ] and HotpotQA [ 13 ] datasets, we employ GPT-4o as the backend model to simulate the graph-based planning process. The prompt template refers to Appendix ˜ B .\\nTo ensure the quality of the GAP training, we implemented a filtering process to select only high-quality, non-trivial trajectories from the varied data sources. We apply three key filtering criteria to curate the training data:\\n(1) Complexity threshold: We remove samples that can be completed with fewer than 3 search operations, as such trajectories are overly simplistic and do not benefit from parallel retrieval strategies.\\n(2) Task diversity: We maintain a 6:4 ratio between samples utilizing parallel retrieval and those using sequential retrieval, ensuring the model’s generalization capability across different retrieval patterns.\\n(3) Length constraint: We filter out excessively long samples, retaining only those within approximately 2000 tokens. Overlong samples typically indicate missing relevant content in the offline dataset rather than genuine retrieval difficulty, and such redundant samples are detrimental to training efficiency, particularly given our objective of minimizing redundancy and maximizing retrieval efficiency.\\nFollowing this pipeline, approximately 7,000 high-quality training trajectories were generated through trajectory synthesis and quality filtering.\\nWe fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct model on our filtered dataset. The model learns to internalize graph-based planning strategies, enabling it to solve tasks by leveraging graph representations. The training objective minimizes:\\nwith observation masking ( 𝒪 \\\\mathcal{O} ) to prevent environmental noise propagation. This establishes robust cold start for downstream RL.\\nWhile supervised training establishes a baseline understanding of parallel execution, it merely guides the model to imitate the provided demonstrations, and does not optimize computational efficiency or reasoning effectiveness. We further fine-tune the language model with fully end-to-end reinforcement learning.

This approach is inspired by the multi-agent distillation framework proposed by Chain-of-Agents [ 11 ] . Starting with the Natural Questions (NQ) [ 12 ] and HotpotQA [ 13 ] datasets, we employ GPT-4o as the backend model to simulate the graph-based planning process. The prompt template refers to Appendix ˜ B .\\nTo ensure the quality of the GAP training, we implemented a filtering process to select only high-quality, non-trivial trajectories from the varied data sources. We apply three key filtering criteria to curate the training data:\\n(1) Complexity threshold: We remove samples that can be completed with fewer than 3 search operations, as such trajectories are overly simplistic and do not benefit from parallel retrieval strategies.\\n(2) Task diversity: We maintain a 6:4 ratio between samples utilizing parallel retrieval and those using sequential retrieval, ensuring the model’s generalization capability across different retrieval patterns.\\n(3) Length constraint: We filter out excessively long samples, retaining only those within approximately 2000 tokens. Overlong samples typically indicate missing relevant content in the offline dataset rather than genuine retrieval difficulty, and such redundant samples are detrimental to training efficiency, particularly given our objective of minimizing redundancy and maximizing retrieval efficiency.\\nFollowing this pipeline, approximately 7,000 high-quality training trajectories were generated through trajectory synthesis and quality filtering.',\n",

Beyond accuracy improvements, GAP demonstrates significant efficiency gains on multi-hop reasoning tasks through parallel decomposition of independent sub-queries. As shown in Table ˜ 2 and Figure ˜ 3 , our method achieves superior performance across multiple efficiency metrics compared to sequential baselines. Figure ˜ 2 further illustrates this advantage through a performance-cost trade-off analysis on HotpotQA. Our analysis reveals several key findings:\\nOur method demonstrates particular strength on multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming the best baseline by 0.9% on average across four multi-hop datasets (HotpotQA, 2Wiki, Musique, Bamboogle). This indicates that GAP successfully learns strategies for decomposing and parallelizing complex queries. On single-hop questions, GAP achieves comparable performance to ZeroSearch, which trains an LLM to simulate search engines and generate pseudo-context. Compared to Search-R1, our method shows a substantial 3.95% improvement.\\nCompared to Search-R1, which retrieves information via sequential query generation, GAP significantly reduces the number of LLM interaction turns. On HotpotQA, GAP requires only 1.78 turns compared to Search-R1’s 2.27 turns (21.6% reduction), while on 2Wiki, the reduction is even more pronounced (2.03 vs. 3.05 turns, 33.4% reduction). The cumulative distribution functions in Figure 3 further illustrate this advantage: our method efficiently responds to questions within 2 turns in most cases, whereas Search-R1 typically requires 3-6 turns. This reduction in interaction turns directly translates to faster execution times, with GAP achieving 32.3% and 21.4% time cost reductions on HotpotQA (168 vs. 248s) and 2Wiki (206s vs. 262s), respectively. Notably, the model autonomously determines parallelizability based on learned patterns during inference, demonstrating strong generalization ability.\\nGAP also significantly reduces response length compared to baselines.

This reduction in generated tokens directly decreases deployment costs and increases throughput, which are critical factors for real-world applications. Furthermore, these efficiency gains generalize across domains: while HotpotQA is an in-domain dataset, similar improvements are observed on out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating that the learned parallel decomposition patterns transfer effectively to new scenarios.

By explicitly modeling task dependencies through graph-based planning, GAP addresses the fundamental limitation of sequential execution in existing approaches like ReAct, achieving significant improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. Our key contribution lies in training agent foundation models to decompose complex queries into dependency graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. Through a carefully designed two-stage training strategy, we demonstrate that GAP substantially outperforms traditional sequential baselines, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Training Large Language Models for multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) represents a promising frontier in Reinforcement Learning.\\nRepresentative works such as ARPO [ 26 ] , SimpleTIR [ 9 ] , and ToRL [ 8 ] adopt similar strategies: models are post-trained with SFT or RL, and outputs are structured (e.g., <code>…</code>) to trigger tool execution, feeding results back into the reasoning loop. Some extend RL-based Tool-Integrated Reasoning by improving small LLMs’ tool-use capability, stabilizing multi-turn reasoning, and rewarding tool-use sequences independent of final answers.\\nToday, such tool-integrated reasoning is no longer a niche capability but a baseline feature of advanced agentic models. Mature commercial and open-source systems, such as OpenAI’s DeepResearch and o3 [ 27 ] , Kimi K2 [ 28 ] , Microsoft rStar2-Agent [ 29 ] and Meituan LongCat [ 30 ] , routinely incorporate these RL-honed strategies, underscoring the centrality of outcomedriven optimization in tool-augmented intelligence.\\nRecent work theoretically proves that TIR fundamentally expands LLM capabilities beyond the “invisible leash” of pure-text RL by introducing deterministic tool-driven state transitions, establishes token-efficiency arguments for feasibility under finite budget.\\nThe development of Agent Foundation Models (AFMs) marks a pivotal shift towards building models with innate reasoning and tool-use capabilities. A significant insight driving this field is that exceptional agentic performance is not solely dependent on model scale. Recent pioneering works, notably Chain-of-Agents [ 11 ] and Cognitive Kernel-Pro [ 31 ] , have demonstrated that even models at smaller scales can achieve state-of-the-art agentic abilities when trained with rigorous, purpose-built paradigms.\\nThese approaches address the limitations of scale-dependent capabilities through two key innovations: sophisticated data synthesis and specialized agent-centric training. The Chain-of-Agents framework employs a process of multi-agent knowledge distillation and outcome-driven reinforcement learning.

However, existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution, failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Psychiatric disorders account for over 125 million disability-adjusted life years globally (Collaborators et\\xa0al., 2022 ) . A major challenge lies in psychiatric comorbidity, i.e., the co-occurrence of multiple conditions, which significantly complicates diagnosis and treatment. For instance, in a Netherlands study of depression and anxiety, 67% of individuals with a primary depression diagnosis had current and 75% had lifetime comorbid anxiety disorders (Lamers et\\xa0al., 2011 ) . Yet, most existing datasets and models narrowly focus on single disorders (Aich et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Yao et\\xa0al., 2022 ) , while the few corpora covering multiple conditions lack fine-grained annotations and fail to capture symptom co-occurrence and progression within diagnostic processes (Sun et\\xa0al., 2021 ; Yin et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Cohan et\\xa0al., 2018 ) . As a result, large language models (LLMs) have not been systematically evaluated on multi-disorder diagnostic tasks, limiting the development of reliable screening systems that require step-by-step reasoning grounded in DSM-5 standards (Association et\\xa0al., 2013 ) . 1 1 1 DSM-5 is the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders by the American Psychiatric Association. It provides standardized criteria for diagnosing mental disorders and is used to ensure accuracy and consistency.\\nTo construct large-scale comorbidity diagnostic dialogues, diverse patient profiles reflecting real-world complexity are needed. Such dialogues are essential because they simulate step-by-step diagnostic reasoning and enable downstream applications such as multi-disorder screening, clinical decision support, and the training of dialogue agents for psychiatry. Yet profiles alone often lack structured detail to support accurate diagnosis. Electronic medical records (EMRs), by contrast, provide a standardized format that includes a wide range of clinical data, such as symptoms and medical history, which are crucial for later training. Still, EMRs can not handle diverse and complex clinical scenarios during diagnosis and treatment planning and do not capture the dynamic doctor–patient interaction, making it necessary to design a structured clinical dialogue flow that guides the diagnostic process and ensures realism and clinical validity.\\nThis work aims to advance comorbidity diagnosis through the construction of PsyCoTalk, a large-scale dialogue dataset designed for both data-driven modeling and systematic evaluation of diagnostic reasoning. Our framework transforms self-reported social media posts into structured EMRs, which serve directly as patient agent profiles to drive a three-agent diagnostic system (doctor, patient, tool) for generating clinically grounded multi-turn dialogues. As illustrated in Figure\\xa01 , we introduce an innovative data construction and dialogue generation pipeline and make three key contributions:\\n• We develop a nuanced pipeline for EMR-driven dialogue generation that constructs synthetic, clinically grounded EMRs for comorbidity patients, offering a set of 502 synthetic EMRs along with detailed personal experiences reflecting common comorbid conditions, including Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar and Attention-Deficits .\\n• We propose a clinically grounded multi-agent framework combining a Hierarchical Diagnostic State Machine (HDSM) and Diagnosis Context Tree (DCT) for diagnosis, inspired by clinical interview manuals and covering 130+ diagnostic states while following psychiatric assessment protocols.\\n• We introduce PsyCoTalk , a large-scale dataset of 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues grounded in our EMRs and validated by psychiatrists, which is the largest of its kind and features longer and more clinically deep dialogues compared to existing corpora.',\n",

Single‑disorder resources dominate: D 4 (Yao et\\xa0al., 2022 ) contains 1\\u2009339 Chinese doctor–patient dialogues on depression; PsyQA (Sun et\\xa0al., 2021 ) offers 22\\u2009000 question–answer pairs, later enlarged to 55\\u2009000 supportive conversations in SMILECHAT (Qiu et\\xa0al., 2023 ) ; and EFAQA (Hai Liang\\xa0Wang, 2020 ) adds 20\\u2009000 real counselling sessions. Broader clinical sets remain rare. CED‑BS (Aich et\\xa0al., 2024 ) targets bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, while MDD‑5k (Yin et\\xa0al., 2025 ) is the largest Chinese diagnostic corpus so far, with 5\\u2009000 multi‑turn simulations covering more than 25 disorders. Although MDD‑5k uses a one‑to‑many case‑to‑dialogue strategy to boost diversity, it still treats each illness in isolation and offers limited control over combinatorial symptom paths.\\nLLM‑driven dialogue simulation LLMs now power many mental‑health studies. Early work assessed general chatbots: LLM‑Empowered Chatbots (Chen et\\xa0al., 2023 ) measured ChatGPT’s diagnostic empathy, and Patient‑ Ψ \\\\Psi (Wang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) combined cognitive‑behavioural‑therapy rules with LLMs to tutor counsellors.

The AMC framework (Lan et\\xa0al., 2024 ) links doctor, patient, and supervisor agents through a three‑level memory, enabling domain adaptation without fine-tuning. Building on AMC, MDD‑5k introduced a neuro‑symbolic controller and dynamic diagnosis tree to steer topic flow (Yin et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . These ideas inform our HDSM‑Agents , which extends the agent paradigm with a hierarchical state machine and context tree explicitly aligned to authoritative interview standards and, for the first time, generates dialogues reflecting comorbid diagnostic reasoning. Yet no prior corpus or simulator provides a large-scale, clinically structured resource for psychiatric comorbidity. Our work addresses this critical gap for the first time.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'To create standardized EMRs for training purposes, we collaborated with psychiatrists to develop a reference standard based on real clinical cases. Each EMR includes seven key components: Demographic Information , Chief Complaint , Medical Condition , Medical History , Personal History , Family History , and Preliminary Diagnosis . Mental status examination and auxiliary tests are excluded due to the limitations of social media data.\\nDetailed descriptions of the content structure and language requirements for each section are provided in Appendix A.3 .\\nDataset Selection We selected the PsySym (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2022 ) dataset as our base due to its scale, depth of annotation, and suitability for modeling psychiatric comorbidity. PsySym originates from Reddit users with self-reported psychiatric disorders, offering fine-grained symptom-level annotations across 7 major mental disorders. The dataset contains 5,624 diagnosed users, with an average of 102.5 posts per user, making it ideal for our needs. User Filtering To ensure meaningful interactions, we filtered users based on symptom diversity and frequency. We retained users with at least 10 symptom-related posts and 20 distinct symptom types. Using a DSM-5-aligned disease–symptom graph, we excluded users with inconsistent symptom–label pairs, ensuring clinical reliability. Generation Strategy We adopted a modular approach to EMR generation, which outperformed a single-step aggregation method in terms of information recall, classification accuracy, and reasoning coherence. This approach involves categorizing post content into the seven standard EMR sections, generating each section individually using either rule-based methods or LLM inference, and merging them into a complete record. Processing Strategies As illustrated in Figure\\xa02 , we designed four strategies for information extraction and generation:\\nChief Complaint and Medical Condition: Using dual classifiers for symptoms and life events, we generate binary symptom-event vectors for each post, which are then summarized and integrated into prompts for LLM-based generation.\\nMedical, Personal, and Family History: Posts are categorized using keyword-based classification, summarized, and grouped into segments for LLM inference.\\nEducation, Occupation, and Implicit Age: Relevant content is retrieved through keyword search, trimmed with local context, and formatted into structured prompts.\\nGender, Marital Status, and Explicit Age: Demographic information is extracted directly using predefined keyword rules and rule-based classification.\\nAfter two rounds of user filtering and using a modular strategy for content extraction and label injection, we generated 502 structured EMRs from retained texts.

The results are illustrated in Figure\\xa03 . Disease prevalence in synthetic EMRs broadly aligns with real-world data while exhibiting a more balanced distribution. Age shows a peak in the 20–24 group for synthetic data versus 30–34 for real records (Collaborators et\\xa0al., 2022 ) , likely reflecting the younger social media demographic (DataReportal, 2020 ) . Gender proportions are more balanced in synthetic records, consistent with reduced stigma in online contexts (Porteous & Armstrong, 2021 ) . Family history is slightly overrepresented but remains within clinically plausible bounds. Psychiatrist feedback on sampled records confirmed sufficient diversity and clinical plausibility, closely matching real-world documentation.\\nEMRs provide structured and factual information, but they lack the narrative richness and variability found in real patient-doctor interactions. By generating personalized fictitious experiences, we can create a more comprehensive and varied dataset that includes not only the factual data from EMRs but also the nuanced, context-specific details that arise in clinical conversations.\\nPsychiatric diagnoses primarily rely on language-based interactions, making it feasible to generate multiple coherent diagnostic dialogues from a single EMR, provided the symptom presentation remains consistent with the diagnosis (Yin et\\xa0al., 2025 ) .\\nWe therefore propose a personalized fictitious experience generation method grounded in structured EMRs to increase the diversity and realism of simulated dialogues. Unlike MDD-5k, which randomly samples templates, our approach aligns sampled content with EMR attributes to avoid semantic conflicts and incorporates clinically relevant lifestyle attributes. This ensures both semantic coherence and diagnostic validity in generated dialogues.\\nConcretely, we employ LLMs to process each structured EMR via prompt-based instruction tuning. For each case, the model is guided to generate a total of 5 personalized Personal Histories , including both existing entries from the EMR and newly generated ones when necessary. In addition, 10 semantically consistent Fictitious Experiences are produced, all aligned with the EMR content and free from logical conflicts. Here, Personal Histories refer to lifestyle or health background (e.g., “prefers light food, smokes and drinks occasionally, and exercises three times per week” ), while Fictitious Experiences describe past events potentially affecting mental health (e.g., “was blamed as the main cause of a failed company project one year ago” ).

       "    'paragraphs': 'To construct a clinically realistic and diverse dataset for psychiatric diagnostic dialogues, we developed a multi-agent framework, that integrates structured EMRs with dynamic dialogue generation. This framework comprises two main components: a clinical-grounded interview pipeline, and a multi-agent execution mechanism.\\nThe Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5-RV) is a standardized tool for assessing mental disorders, offering a systematic approach to symptom evaluation and diagnosis. Adhering to SCID-5-RV grounds our framework in established clinical practices. To guide LLM-based psychiatric interviews, we restructure SCID-5-RV into two parts: a Hierarchical Diagnostic State Machine (HDSM) and a Diagnostic Context Tree (DCT). This design ensures a structured, dynamic, and clinically coherent dialogue flow.\\nHierarchical Diagnostic State Machine (HDSM) The HDSM adheres to the SCID-5-RV protocol, assigning one sub-state machine to each target disorder (MDD, AD, BD, ADHD).\\nEach sub-state machine terminates in explicit diagnostic outcomes; for MDD, the terminal states depression1 – depression5 in Figure\\xa05 represent five mutually exclusive diagnoses (see the complete architecture in Appendix A.7 ).\\nIn contrast to MDD-5k, which selected topics in random order, HDSM enables the agent to both ask questions and refine the diagnosis iteratively, reflecting real clinical reasoning. Following clinical design, the HDSM consists of a Graphical three-level hierarchy:\\nHigh-Level States (HLS) : Overarching modules (e.g., current-episode screening), shown as large hollow rectangles and represent overarching modules, such as current-episode screening (A.1) or episode history (A.15).\\nIntermediate-Level States (ILS) : Group related symptoms under an HLS, displayed as solid rectangles . They group related symptoms under an HLS and typically have no fixed time window. A special subset of ILS, referred to as sub-state groups , is represented by dashed rectangles , and aggregates closely related questions for joint inquiry.\\nBasic-Level States (BLS) : Terminal nodes corresponding to individual questions.drawn as solid circles . These are terminal nodes corresponding to individual questions, typically constrained by time and embedded within sub-state groups.\\nExcept for the dashed sub-state groups, each ILS and BLS node corresponds to a specific question derived from SCID-5-RV. Questions fall into one of four categories:\\n(i) affective or cognitive symptoms,\\n(ii) physiological or behavioral changes,\\n(iii) functional impairment or risk, and\\n(iv) comorbid or contributing factors (for a full list of nodes and their categories, see Appendix A.5 ).\\nNatural language cues. Within each sub-state group, only the first question adopts a precise temporal phrase such as “in the past two weeks”; subsequent questions use looser expressions like “recently” to avoid unnatural repetition.\\nBinary symptom scale and flow control. The original four-point SCID-5-RV symptom scale (“unclear”, “absent”, “subthreshold”, “threshold”) is reduced to a binary form: present or absent .\\nColored arrows in Figure\\xa05 illustrate how different responses guide the interview trajectory.\\nIf a BLS node has no valid successor, the agent performs a localized random traversal within the sub-state group. The transition to the next diagnostic state occurs only after all terminal BLS nodes (i.e., those without successors) have been visited. If the number of “positive” (i.e., “present”) responses exceeds a threshold, the group is deemed positive and follows the corresponding path; otherwise, it is absent and triggers an alternative transition.\\nDiagnostic Context Tree (DCT) To further enhance the semantic depth and contextual coherence of diagnostic dialogues, we introduce the DCT, a tree-structured semantic controller that operates alongside the HDSM. The DCT is designed to dynamically manage the flow of the dialogue, ensuring that it remains clinically relevant and logically coherent. The top-level branches of the DCT include three main categories: Family History , Personal History , and Experience Inquiry . These categories are structured to capture the comprehensive background information necessary for a thorough psychiatric evaluation.\\nThe Experience Inquiry node within the DCT is dynamically triggered at the end of each turn, based on the context of the conversation. This ensures that the dialogue remains responsive and adaptive to the specific needs of the interaction. After the completion of the HDSM, the remaining leaf nodes of the DCT are visited in a randomized order to maintain a natural flow of conversation. Personal history templates are conditionally selected based on patient gender, ensuring that the dialogue is tailored to the individual patient’s background (see Figure\\xa04 for male-specific examples).\\nBy integrating the DCT with the HDSM, we effectively augment the elicitation of relevant background information, leading to dialogues that are more logically coherent and clinically aligned with real-world psychiatric consultations. This combination ensures that the dialogue not only follows a structured diagnostic process but also incorporates the necessary contextual details to support a comprehensive and accurate diagnosis.\\nOur simulator employs three specialized agents to facilitate each dialogue generation:\\nPatient Agent The patient agent formulates responses based on (i) the structured EMR, (ii) its fictitious personal experience, and (iii) the current topic provided by the tool agent. Initial experiments revealed a bias towards affirming all symptoms, even those not documented in the EMR. To mitigate this, we developed a Disease–Symptom Description Knowledge Graph (DSD-KG) derived from SCID-5-RV guidelines. For each question, the agent consults the DSD-KG; if the symptom is absent from the EMR or contradicts the provisional diagnosis, the agent responds with no . This mechanism filters out hallucinated agreements, enhancing the credibility of the dialogue.\\nDoctor Agent The doctor agent poses questions according to the topic queued by the tool agent. To avoid monotony, we defined five distinct doctor profiles varying in age, specialty, empathy style, verbosity, diagnostic speed, and explanation frequency. Profile cues and high-quality few-shot examples are injected at prompt time, enabling the LLM to adapt its responses (e.g., concise, gentle, or analytical). Reply length limits and a rotating pool of empathy phrases further reduce repetitive responses.\\nTool Agent The Tool Agent serves as the central controller, bridging natural-language dialogue with the symbolic diagnostic framework. Its responsibilities are divided into two main categories: tree management and dialogue coordination.\\nTree Management\\n• Sub-State-Machine-OrderGen(conv) → \\\\rightarrow list: Determines the execution order of the four disorder-specific sub-state machines after the first dialogue turn. It supports two strategies: random shuffle or symptom-informed mode, which prioritizes modules based on current symptoms.\\n• ResponseClassifier(conv) → \\\\rightarrow bool: Classifies the patient’s latest answer as present or absent and forwards this label to the HDSM to trigger state transitions.\\n• NeedExpBranch(conv) → \\\\rightarrow node: Decides whether to enter the “Experience Inquiry” branch of the context tree based on the previous turn’s content.\\nDialogue Interface\\n• BuildPrompt(topic) → text: Generates aligned prompts for the doctor and patient agents based on the current topic node in the diagnostic tree, ensuring semantic consistency.\\n• IsDialEnd(tree) → bool: Determines whether the consultation should terminate. The dialogue ends when all disorder-specific sub-state machines reach their terminal states and all required nodes in the context tree—excluding the optional experience inquiry—have been traversed.',\n",

If the number of “positive” (i.e., “present”) responses exceeds a threshold, the group is deemed positive and follows the corresponding path; otherwise, it is absent and triggers an alternative transition.\\nDiagnostic Context Tree (DCT) To further enhance the semantic depth and contextual coherence of diagnostic dialogues, we introduce the DCT, a tree-structured semantic controller that operates alongside the HDSM. The DCT is designed to dynamically manage the flow of the dialogue, ensuring that it remains clinically relevant and logically coherent. The top-level branches of the DCT include three main categories: Family History , Personal History , and Experience Inquiry . These categories are structured to capture the comprehensive background information necessary for a thorough psychiatric evaluation.\\nThe Experience Inquiry node within the DCT is dynamically triggered at the end of each turn, based on the context of the conversation. This ensures that the dialogue remains responsive and adaptive to the specific needs of the interaction. After the completion of the HDSM, the remaining leaf nodes of the DCT are visited in a randomized order to maintain a natural flow of conversation. Personal history templates are conditionally selected based on patient gender, ensuring that the dialogue is tailored to the individual patient’s background (see Figure\\xa04 for male-specific examples).\\nBy integrating the DCT with the HDSM, we effectively augment the elicitation of relevant background information, leading to dialogues that are more logically coherent and clinically aligned with real-world psychiatric consultations. This combination ensures that the dialogue not only follows a structured diagnostic process but also incorporates the necessary contextual details to support a comprehensive and accurate diagnosis.',\n",

       "     {'title': '4.2 Multi-Agent Execution Mechanism',\n",
       "      'paragraphs': 'Our simulator employs three specialized agents to facilitate each dialogue generation:\\nPatient Agent The patient agent formulates responses based on (i) the structured EMR, (ii) its fictitious personal experience, and (iii) the current topic provided by the tool agent. Initial experiments revealed a bias towards affirming all symptoms, even those not documented in the EMR. To mitigate this, we developed a Disease–Symptom Description Knowledge Graph (DSD-KG) derived from SCID-5-RV guidelines. For each question, the agent consults the DSD-KG; if the symptom is absent from the EMR or contradicts the provisional diagnosis, the agent responds with no . This mechanism filters out hallucinated agreements, enhancing the credibility of the dialogue.\\nDoctor Agent The doctor agent poses questions according to the topic queued by the tool agent. To avoid monotony, we defined five distinct doctor profiles varying in age, specialty, empathy style, verbosity, diagnostic speed, and explanation frequency. Profile cues and high-quality few-shot examples are injected at prompt time, enabling the LLM to adapt its responses (e.g., concise, gentle, or analytical). Reply length limits and a rotating pool of empathy phrases further reduce repetitive responses.\\nTool Agent The Tool Agent serves as the central controller, bridging natural-language dialogue with the symbolic diagnostic framework. Its responsibilities are divided into two main categories: tree management and dialogue coordination.\\nTree Management\\n• Sub-State-Machine-OrderGen(conv) → \\\\rightarrow list: Determines the execution order of the four disorder-specific sub-state machines after the first dialogue turn. It supports two strategies: random shuffle or symptom-informed mode, which prioritizes modules based on current symptoms.\\n• ResponseClassifier(conv) → \\\\rightarrow bool: Classifies the patient’s latest answer as present or absent and forwards this label to the HDSM to trigger state transitions.\\n• NeedExpBranch(conv) → \\\\rightarrow node: Decides whether to enter the “Experience Inquiry” branch of the context tree based on the previous turn’s content.\\nDialogue Interface\\n• BuildPrompt(topic) → text: Generates aligned prompts for the doctor and patient agents based on the current topic node in the diagnostic tree, ensuring semantic consistency.\\n• IsDialEnd(tree) → bool: Determines whether the consultation should terminate. The dialogue ends when all disorder-specific sub-state machines reach their terminal states and all required nodes in the context tree—excluding the optional experience inquiry—have been traversed.',\n",

       "   {'title': '5 Final Product: PsyCoTalk Dataset',\n",
       "    'paragraphs': 'Generation Process We begin with 502 structured EMRs from PsyCoProfile. For each EMR, we sample five distinct fictitious experiences from the generated 𝒟 fic \\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\text{fic}} and pair them with five different personal histories from 𝒟 his \\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\text{his}} , resulting in five Fictitious Experience Descriptions (FEDs) that capture patient-specific contextual narratives. Each FED is assigned a unique doctor profile that varies in empathy level, verbosity, and diagnostic pacing. All three agents—the doctor, patient, and tool agent—are instantiated using the Qwen2.5-72B model (Bai et\\xa0al., 2023 ) , deployed locally on a server with four NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs using vLLM (Kwon et\\xa0al., 2023 ) . For each FED and doctor profile pair, we generate two dialogues using different sub-state machine scheduling strategies: one that is symptom-informed and another that uses a randomly determined order. This process yields approximately 5,000 dialogues. From these, we select 3,000 dialogues whose final diagnostic labels match one of the six predefined comorbidity combinations in PsyCoProfile to form the final PsyCoTalk dataset. As all human evaluators are native Chinese speakers, we release only the Chinese version to ensure annotation quality. For comparative analysis, we include two additional Chinese diagnostic datasets, D 4 and MDD-5k , along with a de-identified clinical dialogue set ( Real-World Dial ) obtained from a psychiatric hospital. Dataset statistics are reported in Table\\xa02 .\\nEvaluation We conduct two types of human evaluation. First, 50 dialogues from PsyCoTalk are rated in a double-blind fashion by five licensed psychiatrists with more than seven years of clinical experience. Each dialogue is evaluated across six dimensions grouped under four criteria: Professionalism , Communication , Fluency , and Realism . Professionalism assesses whether the doctor successfully elicits all symptoms necessary for diagnosis. Communication evaluates (i) the doctor’s proactivity in questioning and (ii) the patient’s responsiveness. Fluency measures (i) syntactic and topical coherence and (ii) avoidance of redundancy. Realism assesses how closely the dialogue resembles actual psychiatric consultations. Second, we perform an AB test using 10 two-turn excerpts sampled from each dataset (PsyCoTalk, D 4 , MDD-5k, and Real-World Dial). The same five psychiatrists are asked to judge whether each excerpt appears real or AI-generated. Each excerpt identified as “real” receives one point, and final realism scores are normalized to a 10-point scale.\\nObjective Comparison As shown in Table\\xa02 , PsyCoTalk excels in scale and structural fidelity. It is the only dataset for psychiatric comorbidity, with 3,000 dialogues-over twice D 4 and close to MDD-5k. Each conversation averages 45.9 turns, nearly double other corpora. Utterance lengths are 34.0 characters (doctors) and 43.5 (patients), closest to real clinical conversations (28.3 and 35.8). By contrast, MDD-5k deviates most, with overly long utterances that reduce realism.\\nTo verify the effectiveness of the fictitious personal experience module under EMR reuse and to validate the cross-lingual generalization of our pipeline, we assess dialogue diversity and conduct a small-scale English generation experiment compared with existing corpora; detailed metrics and results are reported in Appendix A.2 .\\nTo assess diagnostic accuracy, we use initial EMR labels as ground truth and evaluate with exact-match (all 5 disorders correct). A zero-shot Qwen2.5-72B baseline reaches 0.22 subset accuracy, while our HDSM-guided multi-agent system improves to 0.31 , a significant gain (McNemar’s test, p = 7 × 10 − 6 < 0.001 p=7\\\\times 10^{-6}<0.001 ). On 200 sampled cases, GPT-4o-mini and Deepseek-v3 achieve below 0.1, Qwen3-32B below 0.02, and Qwen3-8B below 0.04. Per-label F1: MDD ( 0.92 ), AD ( 0.81 ), ADHD ( 0.64 ), BD ( 0.40 ). These align with clinical trends where BD and ADHD are harder to diagnose than MDD and AD due to symptom overlap, subtler onset, and higher heterogeneity (Hui et\\xa0al., 2018 ; Barkley & Brown, 2008 ) .\\nSubjective Results Table\\xa04 summarizes expert evaluation results across six dimensions. PsyCoTalk ranks highest in communication (8.14 for doctor initiative, 8.24 for patient engagement), alongside strong scores in professionalism (7.72) and fluency (7.42 and 6.79), reflecting coherent and context-aware interactions. In the AB test for perceived realism, Table\\xa04 shows that PsyCoTalk achieves a score of 5, second only to real-world data (6), indicating that its dialogue style closely approximates clinical expectations. By contrast, MDD-5k scores the lowest (1) due to its templated and repetitive utterances, which reduce perceived authenticity. These findings confirm that our HDSM-based multi-agent framework produces dialogues that are not only diagnostically informative but also linguistically coherent and clinically credible across diverse expert judgments.',\n",

This work does not involve human subjects, identifiable private data, or harmful applications.\\nNo external sponsorship or conflict of interest influenced the design or conclusions of this work.\\nData provenance and privacy. The raw posts that seed PsyCoProfile are drawn from the publicly available PsySym corpus, whose collection was approved by an institutional review board (IRB I2022158P) and complies with the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China. All posts are anonymous, stripped of usernames, time stamps and locations, and stored under random identifiers. Our pipeline rewrites each post into a synthetic electronic medical record; no verbatim text that could re-identify an author is retained. The fictitious personal histories and life events are generated entirely by large language models. Five licensed psychiatrists reviewed random samples and confirmed that no record contains protected health information or disallowed content. The final dialogues in PsyCoTalk are synthetic and will be released only under a data-usage agreement that forbids attempts at re-identification or clinical deployment.\\nIntended use and risk mitigation. The dataset is designed for research on multi-disorder screening and dialogue modelling. It is not a diagnostic tool, nor does it provide treatment advice. Synthetic conversations may still reflect biases inherited from web data and large language models; users must apply rigorous evaluation before any downstream use. We urge practitioners to keep humans in the loop when analysing sensitive mental-health text, and to follow relevant professional, legal and ethical guidelines. Future work will extend coverage while continuing to consult ethics boards and domain experts.\\nSocietal impact. This work has the potential to positively contribute to early-stage screening research and the development of more inclusive diagnostic tools for psychiatric profiles, particularly in settings with limited clinical resources. However, the release of realistic synthetic dialogues and records also raises risks of misuse, such as inappropriate clinical adoption or amplification of model biases in downstream systems. To mitigate these risks, we emphasize that the dataset is strictly intended for research use and should be paired with responsible modeling and evaluation practices. Broader impacts will be monitored in future iterations in collaboration with ethics committees and clinical stakeholders.\\nAnnotator Compensation. We ensured fair compensation for all annotators. They were compensated at a rate of $25/hour. This rate is above the local minimum wage and aligns with guidelines for ethical crowdsourcing practices. Annotators were briefed about the nature of the task, estimated time per task, and payment prior to participation.',\n",

As shown in Table\\xa05 , PsyCoTalk-eng achieves higher normalized entropy and semantic diversity than Alex, while Chinese PsyCoTalk exhibits a higher Hapax proportion but lower semantic diversity than its English counterpart. This discrepancy may be attributed to language structure: Chinese tends to use more unique or low-frequency words, while English dialogues often display greater semantic variation.\\nWe compare word frequency distributions in 200 sampled English and 200 Chinese dialogues, tokenized by NLTK (English) and jieba (Chinese). The top 100 high-frequency words (frequency > 100 >100 ) are categorized into four groups, and the results are summarized in Table\\xa06 . Here, High-freq Count (%) refers to the number and proportion of distinct word types from each category that appear among the top 100 (e.g., 28 Chinese words fall into “Symptoms/States,” accounting for 35%). Total Freq (%) denotes the cumulative frequency and proportion of all words in that category within the sampled dialogues (e.g., Chinese symptom/state words occur 27,342 times in total, 21.88% of all top-100 occurrences). This dual perspective captures both the lexical coverage (Count) and the usage weight (Total Freq) of different categories across languages.\\nAlthough distributional differences exist, both languages are dominated by descriptive and symptom-related words, with similar category rankings. Figure\\xa06 illustrates representative word clouds for the “symptom/state” category in both languages, showing numerous synonymous or semantically close pairs (e.g., anxious /烦躁, mind /心里/脑子里).\\nEnglish words exhibit a more even distribution, potentially due to linguistic structural differences.\\nThis appendix provides detailed specifications for each section in the standardized EMR template developed in this study. The content structure was developed based on a standard clinical case template obtained directly from practicing psychiatrists. This template reflects real-world documentation practices used in psychiatric settings and was adopted to ensure clinical realism and consistency.\\nDemographic Information should include the patient’s gender, age, educational background, marital status, and occupation. The language should be concise and factual.\\nChief Complaint describes the primary psychological symptoms reported by the patient, along with their duration. The text should be brief, focused, and clinically relevant.\\nMedical Condition covers the current psychiatric presentation in more detail. This includes the onset and course of symptoms, any identifiable triggers, and the impact on the patient’s daily functioning. General physical health indicators such as sleep patterns, appetite, and weight changes should also be summarized when available.\\nMedical History lists prior medical conditions including chronic diseases, previous hospitalizations, surgical procedures, known allergies, and history of infections. This section helps assess comorbid risks.\\nPersonal History records health-related lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and drug consumption. In female patients, it may also include relevant information on menstruation.\\nFamily History identifies psychiatric or neurological disorders in close biological relatives (e.g., parents, siblings). Information should be structured to reflect genetic predisposition or family dynamics relevant to diagnosis.\\nPreliminary Diagnosis provides an initial clinical impression based on the information presented in the EMR. This diagnosis is tentative and may refer to DSM-based categories such as MDD, BD, or ADHD, depending on symptom patterns.\\nTo enrich patient narratives with personalized and semantically coherent context, we design a structured prompt-based mechanism for generating Fictitious Experience Descriptions . The generation is executed by the Tool Agent using an instruction-following large language model.\\nThe input to this process is a template sentence derived from each patient’s structured EMR, formatted as: “I am a { age } -year-old { gender } with { diagnosis } , currently working or studying as a { occupation } . Past experience: { experience } ” . The fields { age }, { gender }, { diagnosis }, and { occupation } are directly drawn from the EMR, while { experience } is sampled from the fictitious experience dictionary 𝒟 fic \\\\mathcal{D}_{\\\\text{fic}} .\\nThe prompt guides the model to craft a first-person narrative that elaborates on the given background, using the following system message:\\n“You are a powerful, imaginative text assistant skilled at writing stories. Given keywords describing a patient’s mental health background and experiences, imagine and write a detailed, first-person account of the patient’s past. Expand on the causes, progression, and consequences of a psychologically impactful event. Do not use metaphors, exaggerated language, or fictitious names. Avoid therapeutic expressions like ‘under the doctor’s guidance’ or ‘trying to get better.’ The output should be a coherent and realistic narrative.”\\nAn example output is shown below :\\nFour years ago, I was a 12-year-old middle school student. I was cheerful by nature, but often had trouble focusing. During class, I couldn’t help but look around, and my hands were constantly doodling on paper. The teacher was very displeased and reminded me multiple times to pay attention, but it barely worked.\\nOne day in math class, the teacher was explaining a complicated geometry problem. I had stayed up late the night before playing video games, and couldn’t follow the lesson at all. My attention drifted, and the teacher’s voice gradually became a blur. Suddenly, the teacher raised his voice, “You! Stand up!” I was startled, jumped to my feet, heart pounding, and my face flushed with embarrassment.\\nHe stared at me sternly and said in front of the entire class, “You’re not listening again, are you? With that kind of attitude, how do you expect to succeed? Do you think your parents would be proud of this?” The room fell silent. All eyes were on me. I felt utterly humiliated, and tears welled up in my eyes. The teacher went on: “If you don’t take this seriously, you’ll never amount to anything.”\\nHis words pierced through me like needles. I felt defeated and deeply ashamed. After class, students whispered among themselves—some mocked me, others looked at me with pity. I locked myself in the bathroom and cried uncontrollably.\\nFor a while after that, I began to fear going to school. Just entering the classroom would make my palms sweat, and I couldn’t concentrate at all. My grades plummeted. My parents, anxious and disappointed, constantly scolded me for not studying properly.\\nA few months later, I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD. The doctor said that the public criticism had dealt a severe psychological blow, and combined with academic pressure and high family expectations, it ultimately triggered the onset of my condition.\\nThis prompt design ensures that generated Fictitious Experience Descriptions are aligned with EMR content, emotionally rich, and free from contradictions. It balances creative storytelling with medical plausibility, enabling the system to simulate realistic psychological histories without relying on deterministic templates.\\nThis appendix collates the full hierarchy of the HDSM, aligning each Basic‑, Intermediate‑, and High‑Level State with its corresponding clinical topic. States are grouped according to the four SCID‑5–derived categories:\\n(i) Affective & Cognitive Symptoms,\\n(ii) Physiological & Behavioral Changes,\\n(iii) Functional Impairment & Risk, and\\n(iv) Comorbid or Contributing Factors.\\nFor completeness, terminal nodes that represent each sub‑state machine’s final diagnostic outcomes are also listed.\\nThe lists that follow serve as a reference for all experiments, ensuring that every state’s semantic scope—and its precise role in the dialogue‑generation pipeline—is clearly documented.\\nI. MDD Sub‑State Machine (including HBL\\u2005A.1, A.15)\\nA.1: Current Major‑Depressive‑Episode Screening\\nA.15: History of Major‑Depressive Episodes\\nII.

ADHD State Machine (including HBL\\u2005K.1)\\nK.1: Comprehensive ADHD Symptom Assessment\\nTo aid interpretability, we provide an English translation of a structured EMR originally generated in Chinese. As shown in Figure\\xa07 , the record describes a 20–24-year-old unmarried female student with a history of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety.\\nThe chief complaint includes emotional instability, fatigue, and occasional negative thoughts. Her medical condition outlines symptom progression over 28 months, including episodes of social withdrawal, panic attacks, sleep disturbances, and compulsive behavior, with gradual improvement following psychological intervention. Her past medical history includes SSRI treatment, hospitalization, and CBT, as well as group-based mindfulness therapy and weekly psychiatric supervision.\\nHer family history is positive for bipolar disorder (mother) and antisocial personality disorder (father). Personal history reports menstrual irregularities, no smoking, regular caffeine intake, and a preference for outdoor exercise. Demographics indicate a university education and no history of marriage. The preliminary diagnosis is depression and anxiety.\\nFigure\\xa05 presents the full structure of the Hierarchical Diagnostic State Machine (HDSM), covering all four targeted psychiatric disorders. Each disorder is assigned an independent sub-state machine, with corresponding high-level states (HLS) shown in the figure: A.1 and A.15 for MDD, F.25 and F.31 for AD, A.1, A.43, and D.1 for BD, and K.1 for ADHD.\\nEach HLS contains one or two sub-state groups (dashed rectangles), except D.1, which serves as a summary node in the BD sub-state machine. Sub-state groups are designed based on SCID-5-RV item clusters, preserving clinical logic and content alignment. Each sub-state group has a predefined threshold, typically 3 or 5, for determining whether the collected responses support a positive diagnostic transition. This design enables the system to emulate real-world psychiatric evaluations with high clinical fidelity.\\nTerminal states, such as depression1 through depression5 in the MDD branch, represent mutually exclusive diagnostic outcomes based on structured symptom elicitation. All state transitions, node categories, and thresholds strictly follow the SCID-5-RV guidelines, ensuring consistency between the simulated dialogue flow and professional diagnostic protocols.\\nTo illustrate the structure and quality of PsyCoTalk, we present an example doctor–patient dialogue in both Chinese (original) and English (translated) versions. These dialogues are generated by multi-agent interaction under the Diagnosis-Agents framework, where the patient agent is instantiated with a personalized EMR and fictitious experience, and the doctor agent is guided by a structured diagnostic state machine.\\nThe dialogue includes a complete diagnostic process, from initial inquiry to the final diagnosis issued by the doctor agent. We present below an English translation of the original dialogues for illustrative purposes (see Figure\\xa09 – Figure\\xa014 ).',\n",

Just entering the classroom would make my palms sweat, and I couldn’t concentrate at all. My grades plummeted.

       "    'paragraphs': 'The ocean plays a crucial role in multiple aspects of the planet, from regulating the global climate [ 1 ] to the availability of strategic marine resources [ 2 ] . Understanding its processes and predicting changes is essential for decision-making in the fishing industry and maritime transport sectors [ 3 ] . Anticipating the behavior of oceanographic variables is important in the current scenario [ 4 ] , marked by climate change and the urgent need for sustainable policies [ 5 ] , including the development of new tools to assess the present and future states of the Earth, as current approaches are still limited [ 6 ] .\\nOcean analysis is critical since it influences global climate, storm formation, and heat exchange with the atmosphere through sea surface temperature [ 7 ] . Additionally, marine biodiversity depends on the dynamic balance of the ocean’s physical and chemical properties. Human activities also require information about ocean conditions to ensure safety, optimize maritime routes, manage energy resources, and implement ecological policies [ 8 ] .\\nTraditional ocean prediction methodologies rely on numerical models that solve complex fluid dynamics equations. However, these models struggle to capture data across multiple spatial and temporal scales and have high computational costs. These limitations, combined with the increasing volume of data, create new research opportunities. In this context, deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative to overcome these challenges, enabling the processing of large volumes of data across different scales. Furthermore, with the growing quantity and diversity of data from in situ sources, satellites, and reanalysis, we now have an opportunity to address these challenges [ 9 ] .\\nThese new models learn complex relationships from data without explicitly relying on physical equations. By removing the strict dependence on theoretical formulations, it becomes feasible to capture patterns that emerge from the interaction of multiple variables. This approach can provide more detailed solutions, reduce computational costs, and integrate heterogeneous data. Models based on deep learning could enable the development of more efficient methods in various scenarios [ 10 ] .\\nThe field of atmospheric prediction has witnessed a transformative shift with the advent of deep learning models. Recent breakthroughs include models like FourCastNet [ 11 ] , known for its speed and accuracy in predicting extreme weather events, and GraphCast [ 12 ] , which demonstrates remarkable skill in medium-range global weather forecasting based on Graph Neural Networks. Furthermore, models such as NeuralGCM [ 13 ] explore the integration of neural networks within general circulation models, aiming to enhance the representation of sub-grid scale processes. More recently, the Aurora [ 14 ] model has emerged, showcasing the potential of deep learning to not only predict atmospheric conditions but also to extend these capabilities to coupled systems by learning complex interactions across different Earth system components. These advancements signify a new era in weather and climate modeling, promising more efficient and accurate predictions for a range of applications.\\nThis work aims to adapt the Aurora foundational model, initially developed for global atmospheric applications, to subregional ocean prediction. The model is fine-tuned for predicting the evolution of the SST in the Canary Upwelling System. We are interested in adapting the model for predicting the ocean’s potential temperature ( θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} ) in a specific geographic area and period. Its three-dimensional architecture enables the efficient integration of complex and heterogeneous data. Additionally, its reduced training time, ability to leverage previously learned representations, and flexibility to incorporate data from various sources make it an ideal candidate for tackling current challenges in ocean prediction.\\nWe use data from the GLORYS12V1 [ 15 ] ocean prediction system of the Copernicus Marine Service [ 16 ] . This corresponds to the global ocean physical reanalysis, which provides three-dimensional daily fields with a horizontal resolution of 1/12° and 50 vertical levels. This dataset, based on the assimilation of satellite and in situ observations, provides information on potential temperature, salinity, currents, and two-dimensional variables, such as sea level and mixed-layer thickness.\\nThis model offers advantages in terms of computational cost reduction and prediction quality, although limitations exist due to the complexity of the domain and physical constraints. This should be seen as complementary to other methodologies rather than a complete replacement.\\nSection 2 summarizes state-of-the-art works. Section 3 details the dataset used in this work and the area of study. Section 4 explains the Aurora model and how we adapted it to our problem. The experimental configuration in Section 5 addresses various details about the training process, the loss function, and the metrics used to evaluate the model.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Prediction in oceanography is essential for anticipating and understanding natural phenomena that affect global climate and various human activities [ 17 ] . Sea temperature plays a fundamental role in the distribution of water masses, global circulation, and the ocean-atmosphere energy balance [ 18 , 19 ] . Thus, estimating changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ocean, such as temperature, is crucial for multiple activities [ 20 ] , in addition to being key to anticipating natural risks.\\nOcean observation and prediction results from global efforts [ 10 ] , in which multiple national and international agencies contribute scientific data. Among them, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stands out as it establishes frameworks for international cooperation in data exchange, standardization of procedures, and guidelines that facilitate climate understanding on a planetary scale [ 21 ] .\\nThe Copernicus Program, promoted by the EU in collaboration with the ESA, provides services and information about the ocean [ 16 ] . The Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) integrates satellite observations, in situ measurements, and numerical models to offer various oceanographic products. This service supplies data on sea temperature, salinity, currents, and sea level variables. As a result, it provides a solid foundation for scientific studies, operational applications, and decision-making in marine environments [ 22 ] . On the other hand, the USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also collects and processes oceanic and atmospheric data. These data and products have become standard references for the international community [ 23 ] . Additionally, ECMWF provides reanalysis and numerical models, globally recognized for their quality and accuracy [ 24 ] .\\nSatellite observations have revolutionized ocean monitoring. Missions such as ESA and Copernicus’ Sentinel-3 or NASA’s MODIS [ 25 ] allow for detailed information on sea surface temperature, sea level height, surface salinity, and chlorophyll concentration—among other variables—characterized by high spatial and temporal resolution. However, satellite measurements can be affected by clouds or other atmospheric factors. To compensate for these shortcomings and obtain a more comprehensive view, it is necessary to combine these observations with other data sources [ 26 ] .\\nIn situ data come from direct measurements taken by buoys, research vessels, fixed platforms, and autonomous underwater vehicles [ 27 ] . These measurements provide precise data on key variables. Although these measurements have limited spatial and temporal coverage, their high quality and detail are indispensable for calibration, validation, and assimilation in numerical models. Reanalysis and numerical models integrate satellite and in situ data, offering coherent representations of the ocean.\\nNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models have been essential for predicting ocean dynamics for decades. These models are based on fluid dynamics and thermodynamics equations, solving the evolution of fundamental variables over three-dimensional grids that cover the globe [ 28 ] . The main advantage of NWP lies in its physical consistency, as it is based on fundamental laws governing ocean motion. However, it also has some limitations, such as the high computational cost required to make predictions, which makes high-resolution simulations expensive. Additionally, the complexity of ocean-atmosphere interactions leads to small errors that accumulate over time, reducing the accuracy of long-term predictions and limiting the ability to capture small-scale phenomena [ 29 ] .\\nThese challenges have led to methodologies aimed at increasing the capacity to process large volumes of data in a computationally scalable manner [ 30 ] . In this regard, deep learning has emerged as a promising approach to improving efficiency and accuracy when working with heterogeneous data.\\nInitially, CNNs [ 31 ] gained popularity in meteorology and oceanography due to their ability to capture spatial patterns in two-dimensional data such as temperature maps or ocean currents. Some use cases included precipitation prediction and identifying spatial patterns in the ocean [ 32 ] . However, these models were inefficient at capturing temporal dependencies or three-dimensional structures, limiting their effectiveness for more complex tasks.\\nLater, with the emergence of graph neural networks (GNN), GraphCast [ 12 ] was introduced in 2023, a model capable of tackling medium-range global weather prediction with high detail. This approach leverages graph structures to capture complex spatial relationships, showing promising results in forecasting meteorological and climate variables. Additionally, diffusion-based methods such as GenCast [ 33 ] were developed to integrate uncertainty into the models. This stochastic approach generates multiple future states, making it a valuable tool for scenario analysis and risk assessment, particularly in capturing ocean variability. The Artificial Intelligence/Integrated Forecasting System (AIFS) [ 34 ] is an evolution of GraphCast in which the processor is replaced with a shifted window attention Transformer.\\nGNNs have been adapted to ocean prediction. For instance, SeaCast [ 35 ] implements medium-range ocean forecasting in a limited area region defined by the Mediterranean Sea, and a more recent approach [ 36 , 37 ] predicts the SST in the region of the Canary Islands and the Northwest African coast. The importance of the underlying mesh in these architectures has been studied in [ 38 ] : Structured meshes produce artifacts in medium-range forecasting, which can be tackled using bathymetry-aware unstructured meshes, as shown in [ 39 ] .\\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs in this trajectory came with Transformers [ 40 ] . Their attention mechanism enabled a more efficient representation of spatial and temporal relationships. FourCastNet [ 11 ] integrated adaptive Fourier operators to perform fast and accurate global climate predictions while reducing computational complexity. The three-dimensional architecture of Pangu-Weather [ 41 ] improved vertical representation and the ability to capture complex atmospheric phenomena.\\nOver time, Transformers were further adapted for oceanography. For instance, XiHe [ 42 ] , a model designed for global ocean eddy-resolving forecasting, combined the GLORYS12 reanalysis with data from ERA5 [ 43 ] and satellite observations to anticipate the evolution of physical variables, providing high-resolution estimates. Another example is Orca [ 44 ] , which employed an encoder-based architecture, a fusion module, and a decoder with temporal attention mechanisms to simulate global ocean circulation.\\nMore recently, a three-dimensional foundational model, Aurora [ 14 ] , combined pretraining on vast amounts of heterogeneous data with a fine-tuning process tailored to different scales and variables. Inspired by successes in other fields, such as protein structure prediction and natural language processing [ 45 , 46 ] , Aurora is capable of generating high-resolution forecasts with lower computational costs and greater accuracy in extreme events. This model stands out for its ability to handle sparse and heterogeneous data while overcoming the limitations of other architectures by integrating with different types of climate data.\\nTable 1 illustrates the evolution of deep learning in climate and oceanographic prediction over time. Organized chronologically, this table helps us understand improvements in resolution, the type and quantity of variables that can be handled, and whether the approach is deterministic (D) or stochastic (E).',\n",

The primary function of this service is to offer reliable and up-to-date information on ocean conditions.\\nThe product includes multiple data configurations: daily and monthly averages of three-dimensional variables such as potential temperature, salinity, and currents, as well as surface variables like sea level height, mixed layer thickness, and sea ice characteristics. This structure allows the analysis of mesoscale variability and seasonal patterns, providing a versatile dataset suitable for dynamic and climate studies.\\nThe data is available in NetCDF format, which follows the CF-1.6 convention, ensuring standardization of variables and metadata [ 50 , 51 ] .\\nThe selection of this product is driven by the need for a dataset that combines high spatial resolution with extensive temporal coverage and rigorous scientific quality [ 47 ] . This approach enables the capture of key dynamic phenomena, such as ocean eddies and fronts, while also allowing for the analysis of long-term trends and seasonal cycles.\\nOur study area is limited to the Northeastern Atlantic region, near the African coast and off the Canary Islands, an area of interest due to its intense coastal upwelling phenomena. This region is characterized by high biological productivity and a significant influence on the regional climate [ 52 ] .\\nFigure 1 shows a map of the selected area, highlighting key geographic features relevant to coastal upwellings, such as Capes Ghir and Juby. These capes are crucial in coastal currents and nutrient transport to the surface, promoting phytoplankton proliferation [ 19 ] . Tabla 2 shows the coordinates that define our area of interest.\\nThis region is characterized by a strong influence of the trade winds and the Canary Current, both considered main factors of coastal upwelling, affecting biodiversity and local dynamics [ 20 ] . Our data period extends from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2021. This seven-year interval allows the exploration of seasonal variations and medium-term trends.\\nOur dataset contains a series of variables that provide a general overview of ocean dynamics. These variables range from potential temperature to salinity, sea level height, mixed layer depth, and zonal and meridional components of current velocity [ 7 ] .\\nFigure 2 shows a set of maps for each variable, representing the region of interest. Different patterns highlight the influence of the trade winds and coastal upwelling, showing these factors as generators of distinct thermal and saline gradients.\\nIn this work, we use the potential temperature, θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} . It is defined as the temperature of the water brought to atmospheric pressure. This concept eliminates the effects that pressure generates at different depths. Hence, potential temperature becomes a fundamental tool for comparing water masses and studying the thermal structure of the ocean [ 53 ] . The θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} map shows that the warmest waters are located in the south at the open ocean, while the coldest waters are found in the north and the African coast, in the upwelling region. This pattern is influenced by coastal upwelling and the interactions between the Canary Current and the trade winds [ 20 ] . The θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} map also shows thermal gradients along the coast, indicating active mixing processes. This behavior affects marine biodiversity, as colder waters transport nutrients from the depths to the surface [ 6 ] .\\nIn addition to its relevance in thermal structure, θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} is essential for understanding heat exchange processes between the ocean and the atmosphere [ 18 ] , thus, it becomes a fundamental tool for analyzing seasonal evolution and its impact on the ocean [ 19 ] .\\nOn the other hand, salinity shows a higher concentration in the open ocean, possibly due to thermal influence and ocean circulation [ 7 ] . Sea level height shows patterns of mesoscale dynamics, evidencing depressions and elevations characteristic of ocean eddies [ 30 ] . Mixed layer depth shows low values near the coast, reflecting the influence of surface waters and upwelling masses.\\nThe integration of these variables allows for a holistic view of ocean dynamics in this region. In particular, θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} help us understand the thermal structure and its relationship with physical, biological, and climatic processes. This approach is essential for modeling and predicting the evolution of marine systems in the Northeastern Atlantic [ 54 ] .\\nFigure 3 shows a time series of potential temperature during the study period, elucidating seasonal variations.',\n",

This scheme integrates techniques such as SEEK to assimilate satellite data (sea level altimetry, sea surface temperature) and in situ observations (ARGO profiles and oceanographic cruises), achieving a coherent and physically consistent representation of the global ocean environment [ 48 , 49 ] . The primary function of this service is to offer reliable and up-to-date information on ocean conditions.\\nThe product includes multiple data configurations: daily and monthly averages of three-dimensional variables such as potential temperature, salinity, and currents, as well as surface variables like sea level height, mixed layer thickness, and sea ice characteristics. This structure allows the analysis of mesoscale variability and seasonal patterns, providing a versatile dataset suitable for dynamic and climate studies.\\nThe data is available in NetCDF format, which follows the CF-1.6 convention, ensuring standardization of variables and metadata [ 50 , 51 ] .\\nThe selection of this product is driven by the need for a dataset that combines high spatial resolution with extensive temporal coverage and rigorous scientific quality [ 47 ] . This approach enables the capture of key dynamic phenomena, such as ocean eddies and fronts, while also allowing for the analysis of long-term trends and seasonal cycles.',\n",

Different patterns highlight the influence of the trade winds and coastal upwelling, showing these factors as generators of distinct thermal and saline gradients.\\nIn this work, we use the potential temperature, θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} . It is defined as the temperature of the water brought to atmospheric pressure. This concept eliminates the effects that pressure generates at different depths. Hence, potential temperature becomes a fundamental tool for comparing water masses and studying the thermal structure of the ocean [ 53 ] . The θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} map shows that the warmest waters are located in the south at the open ocean, while the coldest waters are found in the north and the African coast, in the upwelling region. This pattern is influenced by coastal upwelling and the interactions between the Canary Current and the trade winds [ 20 ] . The θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} map also shows thermal gradients along the coast, indicating active mixing processes. This behavior affects marine biodiversity, as colder waters transport nutrients from the depths to the surface [ 6 ] .\\nIn addition to its relevance in thermal structure, θ 0 \\\\theta_{0} is essential for understanding heat exchange processes between the ocean and the atmosphere [ 18 ] , thus, it becomes a fundamental tool for analyzing seasonal evolution and its impact on the ocean [ 19 ] .\\nOn the other hand, salinity shows a higher concentration in the open ocean, possibly due to thermal influence and ocean circulation [ 7 ] . Sea level height shows patterns of mesoscale dynamics, evidencing depressions and elevations characteristic of ocean eddies [ 30 ] .

       "    'paragraphs': 'This section explains the Aurora model and how we adapted it to our purposes. It is a foundational model for atmospheric prediction, but its versatility permits it to be adapted to oceanography. It can process heterogeneous data with multiple variables, pressure levels, and spatial resolutions. These characteristics make Aurora a flexible and scalable system capable of forecasting the physical state of the ocean. This model can be adapted to more limited contexts with scarce data.\\nThe scalability of this model is largely due to the local window attention mechanism and the U-Net [ 55 ] architecture. Both allow for information extraction at multiple scales. This multiscale capability is essential for capturing large- and small-scale structures. The model generates long-term forecasts by iteratively applying its prediction function in an autoregressive way:\\nwhere X ^ t + 1 \\\\hat{X}^{t+1} is the prediction at time t + 1 t+1 and Φ \\\\Phi is the model function. This scheme, analogous to recurrent networks, extends the temporal horizon, although it requires controlling the accumulation of errors. Aurora benefits from parallel training and mixed precision, reducing memory usage without degrading prediction quality. This facilitates its practical implementation in operational contexts, allowing for increased resolution without incurring prohibitive computational costs.\\nAurora presents multiple configurations, differentiated by the number of parameters, the size of the embeddings, and the number of layers in the encoder and decoder. These variations impact computational performance and the model’s ability to capture complex relationships.\\nTable 3 shows the size of the different configurations. We chose the medium-size model, looking for a balance between complexity and computational cost. Additionally, we adopted mixed precision to optimize memory.\\nThe model’s architecture consists of three components: the encoder , the processor , and the decoder . The encoder transforms raw inputs into a normalized internal representation, the processor temporally evolves this representation, capturing significant relationships between the input data, and the decoder restores the variables to their original resolution and levels. The architecture benefits from three-dimensional Transformers and attention mechanisms [ 40 , 56 ] , integrated with U-Net. These components allow feature extraction at various scales, processing data with different resolutions, levels, and static variables.\\nThe objective of the encoder is to unify the inputs into a coherent three-dimensional representation. It converts heterogeneous data into a uniform internal representation, preparing it for the temporal and multiscale processing of the next module. It employs tokenization and compression of climatic states through cross-attention blocks based on a Perceiver IO [ 57 ] model. Thus, each atmospheric and surface variable is represented in a three-dimensional volume, incorporating Fourier encodings that add spatial and temporal information [ 56 ] .\\nTo normalize the information, embeddings based on sinusoidal encodings have been used, assigning each pressure level p l p_{l} a representation of the type:\\nThese embeddings integrate vertical information, reducing pressure levels to a fixed set of latent levels C L C_{L} through Perceiver IO attention mechanisms. This allows the model to work with a manageable number of levels, maintaining the representativeness of vertical conditions while balancing computational cost. Dynamic and static variables are tokenized, incorporating positional and Fourier encoding, which unifies the differences between levels and resolutions.\\nThe backbone is the temporal core of the model, responsible for evolving the internal representation over time. To achieve this, it relies on a 3D Swin Transformer [ 58 , 59 ] , organized with a U-Net structure, which allows it to capture features at multiple scales.\\nAn internal encoder gradually reduces spatial resolution and increases semantic depth. This is followed by an internal decoder, which recovers the original resolution and integrates the information obtained at each level. This hierarchical arrangement combines global and local information, capturing large-scale patterns and more detailed structures.\\nAttention is implemented through local windows, allowing each layer to process spatial subsets. This reduces computational complexity by avoiding global attention that spans entire layers. This local attention is given by:\\nwhere 𝐐 \\\\mathbf{Q} , 𝐊 \\\\mathbf{K} , and 𝐕 \\\\mathbf{V} are the query, key, and value matrices, respectively, and d k d_{k} is the dimension of the keys. These local windows limit attention operations to specific regions. This strategy makes Aurora scalable, allowing it to handle higher resolutions without increasing computational cost.\\nThe result is an enriched representation in which spatiotemporal relationships are explicitly modeled at multiple levels. This representation is then configured to be translated back to the original variables in the decoder.\\nThe latent representation of the variables, generated by the processor, is restored to their original pressure levels and resolution in the decoder. This involves using inverse modules based on Perceiver IO models, which can reconstruct the desired variables from the internal representations, assigning each level and variable its corresponding spatial characteristics.\\nEach variable, v v , and level, l l , is obtained by applying a linear transformation and regrouping spatial patches until the original grid is recovered. Thus, the decoder ensures that the final predictions maintain coherence with the input dimensions and the information captured by the model is translated into physically interpretable forecasts.\\nAdapting the model to oceanographic variables requires fundamental differences from atmospheric conditions. While Aurora was pre-trained assuming distributions and ranges typical of atmospheric variables (normalized in Kelvin and with pressure levels), oceanic variables, such as potential temperature, present narrower ranges and different scales. For example, sea surface temperature usually varies between approximately -2 o C and 30 o C, a narrower range than in atmospheric data. This disparity initially led to unrealistic predictions, as the model expected different distributions.\\nIn the first step, we converted temperatures in Celsius to Kelvin and reduced depth levels. The data were normalized to zero mean and unit variance. Geographic coordinates were refined to maintain consistency in the latitude-longitude grid, and the land mask was carefully interpolated to ensure seamless integration of oceanic variables within the model’s infrastructure.\\nWe scaled the original atmospheric data to a lower resolution of 0.5 ∘ 0.5\\\\circ degrees and carried out an inference with the pre-trained Aurora model. Figure 4 shows the global temperature map in Kelvin in two different time instants and compares to the HRES product. These results indicate that the resolution change was successful.\\nWe adapted the oceanographic data by interpolating, filling in missing values, and converting to Kelvin. The latitude and longitude coordinates are interpolated to match the model’s resolution, and missing values are replaced with the mean. The pre-trained model is loaded, and the predictions with our data are consistent with the expected global atmospheric patterns.\\nInitial attempts with oceanic data did not yield good performance, as the model still carried a bias inherited from its pre-training. To overcome this challenge, we fine-tuned the model in two phases. In the first phase, the entire network was frozen except for the decoder, so that it could learn the ocean variables without altering the already acquired internal representations. Once the decoder assimilated the new dynamics, all the model’s parameters were trained using a lower learning rate to avoid losing prior knowledge. We used the AdamW optimizer as in the original work [ 14 ] , which helps regularize the model and avoids overfitting.',\n",

Finally, the network of the latter was fully fine-tuned with a learning rate of 1 × 10 − 5 \\\\times 10^{-5} , obtaining an RMSE of 0.124K.\\nThese experiments were repeated, increasing the batch size to 8 samples and using more computational resources. This contributed to an approximate time reduction of 15% per epoch. We also increased the number of epochs to 30 and obtained an RMSE of 0.130K for the first strategy and 0.135K for the second one. The last fine-tuning step reduced the RMSE to 0.134K. Table 4 shows the final results obtained in these experiments.\\nWhen the batch size was increased to 8, the results became somewhat more competitive. This finding shows that with better resources, using larger batches speeds up training and also improves the quality of the predictions. The high ACC (ACC ≈ 0.997 \\\\approx 0.997 ) suggests that the model captures the relationships between actual and predicted anomalies. This agreement reveals that the model does not simply fit the mean of the data but also accounts for unique phenomena. As for the Bias, in most cases, values close to -0.060K were obtained, except for the last training, where we obtained a lower bias of -0.033K.\\nFigure 7 presents an example of an inference. This figure shows the target value, the model prediction, and the difference between the two. The values are represented in Kelvin with color scales, where greenish tones indicate intermediate values, and blue and yellow highlight more extreme values between the prediction and target values. The difference between them is shown with a scale centered on zero, where red and blue indicate overestimation and underestimation, respectively.\\nIt reveals that the potential temperature prediction model has more errors in certain regions, such as in coastal zones. This is due to the inherent complexity of these areas, characterized by more intense temperature variations compared to other zones, as noted in [ 52 ] .\\nThe difference manifests the variability in coastal zones through more saturated tones, indicating that the model struggles at the ocean-continent boundary. This difficulty is likely due to the interaction of various factors influencing potential temperature in these zones, such as ocean currents, coastal topography, and local winds. These factors can generate microclimates and significant temperature variations at small spatial scales.\\nIn contrast, conditions in the open ocean are more uniform and stable, and the difference between the model prediction and the observed data is reduced. The lower variability in these areas allows for capturing potential temperature patterns with greater accuracy.\\nThis suggests that specific training aimed at improving the results in coastal areas could improve the overall model’s performance. This training could incorporate high-resolution data of relevant variables in coastal zones or use modeling techniques that better capture the complexity of these zones.\\nAn additional experiment consisted of increasing the prediction to ten days. Each sample included ten temporal steps, and the data was analyzed at each lead time. As the time horizon increases, we arrive at an increasingly challenging scenario, as uncertainty accumulates and small initial inaccuracies can be amplified. Figure 8 shows the evolution of the difference between the prediction and the target value for ten-day forecasts. The difference is small in the first days, and errors accumulate with more autoregressive steps, which become accentuated in the last days. This figure is particularly interesting for identifying errors and analyzing problematic regions. This long-term visualization demonstrates that maintaining effectiveness with an increased time horizon presents a significant challenge.\\nFigure 9 shows the average RMSE for the four seasons over ten-day forecasts. The RMSE increases progressively as the time horizon expands, with greater increases in those seasons that present more difficult conditions. Indeed, summer (plotted in green) shows a more pronounced increase, reaching values close to 0.9K after 10 days, suggesting that seasonal cycles significantly influence the results.',\n",

In contrast, deep learning models derive relationships directly from data, operating without explicit physical constraints. They can anticipate phenomena that are difficult to reproduce numerically and, with sufficient data availability, have the potential to accelerate forecasting processes [ 4 ] .\\nThe results presented in this study demonstrate that deep learning models can leverage prior knowledge from foundational models trained in different contexts. Oceanographic research can benefit from these advances through reduced computational costs, easier integration of diverse data sources, rapid generation of forecasts, and the ability to test numerous configurations efficiently. Given the strong dependence of oceanography on data quality and quantity, the capability of deep learning techniques to assimilate and exploit vast datasets paves the way for long-term innovation.\\nThis work expands the range of forecasting methodologies available to oceanography, introducing approaches not previously explored in the field [ 4 ] . The use of foundational models pretrained in other fields helps lower barriers to entry and enhances resource efficiency.\\nDespite these advantages, several limitations remain: Training three-dimensional models is computationally demanding; hardware constraints significantly affected this study, as each training session required considerable time, limiting both resolution and the number of variables; addressing this challenge would require more powerful resources as suggested in [ 61 ] .\\nAnother key challenge concerns data representativeness. Although the dataset employed here is based on reanalysis products, these are derived from numerical models and partial observations. Consequently, predictions may inherit biases from the underlying data. Regions with sparse observations or suboptimal conditions may yield less accurate results. Future work should incorporate additional information, such as in situ measurements and satellite data, to better evaluate and improve prediction quality.\\nThis study focuses solely on potential temperature; however, ocean dynamics depend on multiple interacting variables, including salinity, density, and currents. Extending the model to incorporate these factors will increase complexity, as the model must learn new interdependencies. Nevertheless, this added complexity could yield more realistic oceanic scenarios and improve predictive accuracy.\\nAnother limitation lies in model interpretability. Neural networks remain largely opaque. Future research should therefore investigate the internal representations and decision-making processes of these models. Enhancing explainability will foster a deeper understanding of how predictions are generated and allow for greater confidence and control [ 62 ] .\\nDespite these challenges, this work opens promising avenues for future exploration. Integrating larger and higher-quality datasets could extend prediction horizons and enhance model robustness. Including additional variables, such as salinity and current velocity, would enable the study of hydrodynamic processes and provide a more comprehensive understanding of ocean behavior. Increasing spatial resolution through high-resolution models is another promising direction, though it will demand greater computational power. This could be achieved through progressive training strategies or by dividing the domain into smaller subregions for subsequent integration.\\nFinally, incorporating physical knowledge directly into training represents another exciting research direction. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) introduce physical constraints by penalizing violations of conservation laws in the loss function. Embedding simplified fluid dynamics equations within the learning process can reduce the model’s dependence on data alone, guiding it toward physically consistent solutions [ 63 , 64 ] .\\nContinual learning also presents a valuable opportunity. Because the ocean is a dynamic and ever-changing system, models that can be regularly updated with new data will improve adaptability and responsiveness to evolving conditions. Such models could react more effectively to extreme events and provide continuously improving forecasts over time.',\n",

Specifically, the Aurora model was successfully applied to forecast ocean potential temperature in a local region.\\nAlthough the atmosphere and ocean are tightly coupled components of the climate system, they differ in structure and dynamics. Atmospheric variables—on which Aurora was originally trained—are organized by pressure levels and evolve rapidly, whereas oceanic variables are distributed by depth, governed by thermo-haline properties, and change more slowly due to higher density [ 53 ] . Aurora’s capacity to assimilate oceanic data and produce coherent results demonstrates cross-domain adaptability, suggesting potential for future knowledge transfer between disciplines.\\nWhile this study focused on potential temperature, the experiments indicate that Aurora can be extended to more complex, multivariable scenarios given sufficient computational resources. The sensitivity observed across training configurations, such as partial layer freezing and learning rate adjustments, highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning and normalization strategies in achieving optimal performance.

Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models; however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational demands.

       "    'paragraphs': 'In recent years, diffusion models (Rombach et\\xa0al., 2022 ) have achieved rapid progress in generative tasks, particularly in visual generation, where state-of-the-art models can synthesize highly realistic images. Within this context, the task of editing existing images according to user requirements has gradually emerged as an important direction (Kawar et\\xa0al., 2023 ) . Recently, diffusion-based foundation models, such as FLUX.1 Kontext (Labs et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , Qwen-Image-Edit (Wu et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , and Step1X-Edit (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025d ) , have been developed. These models can perform precise image editing using only textual instructions, offering a novel solution for instruction-based image editing and providing more powerful tools for image post-processing (Choi et\\xa0al., 2024 ) .\\nAlthough diffusion-based IIE models can achieve impressive editing results, their high inference latency limits their use in real-time applications. Previous research on efficient diffusion inference has primarily focused on image generation. For instance, some studies reduce model parameters through pruning (Rombach et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Castells et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , others decrease model bit-width via quantization (Shang et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Zhao et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , and some employ distillation to reduce model size (Kim et\\xa0al., 2023 ) and the number of timesteps (Sauer et\\xa0al., 2024 ) . In the two-stage inversion-based editing paradigm (Pan et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Wang et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , redundancy in the inversion and denoising stages has been analyzed, leading to methods like EEdit (Yan et\\xa0al., 2025 ) that accelerate both stages simultaneously. However, for the emerging denoising-only paradigm of IIE, the redundancy and feasibility of efficient inference remain largely unexplored.\\nOur study reveals that current IIE models exhibit two significant types of redundancy: 1) Spatial Generation Redundancy. Unlike image generation tasks, which require reconstructing the entire image, IIE models often need to modify only local regions specified by the instructions, while the remaining areas remain essentially unchanged. For example, as shown in Figure 1 , the model edits only the region around the hat. Nevertheless, IIE models apply the same computational effort to both edited and unedited areas, resulting in significant redundancy in the latter.\\n2) Redundancy across diffusion timesteps. First, at neighboring timesteps, the key and value within the attention layers at the same network depth are highly similar. Second, in the middle stages of denoising, the velocity output by the diffusion transformer (DiT) at adjacent timesteps is also highly similar.\\nTo mitigate spatial and temporal redundancy in IIE models, this paper introduces RegionE, a training-free, adaptive, and region-aware generative framework that accelerates the current IIE models.\\nFirstly, we observed that the trajectories of edited regions are often more curved, making it difficult to accurately predict the final edited results at early timesteps, as shown in Figure 1 . In contrast, unedited regions follow nearly linear trajectories, allowing more reliable predictions from the same early steps.\\nBased on this observation, RegionE introduces an Adaptive Region Partition (ARP), which performs a one-step estimation for the final image in the early stage and compares its similarity with the reference (instruction) image. Regions with high similarity (minimal change after editing) are classified as unedited, whereas regions with low similarity are classified as edited.\\nThen, we perform region-aware generation on the two separated parts. Specifically,\\nWe replace multi-step denoising with one-step estimation for the unedited areas and apply region-iterative denoising for edited areas.\\nDuring edited region generation, RegionE discards unedited region tokens and instruction image tokens, and effectively reinjects global context into local generation through our proposed Region-Instruction KV Cache (RIKVCache), which leverages the similarity of key and value across timesteps. This process primarily addresses redundancy in spatial.\\nFinally, regarding temporal redundancy, we find that the velocity outputs of DiT at adjacent timesteps are highly consistent in direction but decay in magnitude over time, with the decay dependent on the timestep.\\nTo exploit this property, RegionE introduces an Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache (AVDCache), which accurately models this pattern and further accelerates the region generation process.\\nExperimental results demonstrate that RegionE achieves speedups of approximately 2.57×, 2.41×, and 2.06× on Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit, respectively, while maintaining PSNR values of 30.520, 32.133, and 31.115 before and after acceleration. Evaluations using GPT-4o further indicate that the perceptual differences are negligible, confirming that RegionE effectively eliminates redundancy in IIE tasks without compromising image quality.\\nThe contributions of our paper are as follows:\\nWe observe that in IIE tasks, unedited regions exhibit nearly linear generation trajectories, allowing early-stage velocities to provide reliable estimates for multi-step denoised images, including the final image. In contrast, edited regions follow more curved trajectories, making the final image harder to predict. Nevertheless, the velocity remains consistent across consecutive timesteps.\\nWe propose RegionE, a training-free, efficient IIE method with adaptive, region-aware generation. It reduces spatial redundancy by performing early adaptive predictions for edited and unedited regions and generating each region locally in subsequent stages, while mitigating temporal redundancy via a velocity-decay cache across timesteps.\\nRegionE achieves 2.57×, 2.41×, and 2.06× end-to-end speedups on Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit, while maintaining PSNR (30.520, 32.133, 31.115) and SSIM (0.939, 0.917, 0.937). Evaluations with GPT-4o further confirm that no quality degradation occurs.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Efficient Diffusion Model. Although few efficient methods have been developed specifically for IIE models, a variety of acceleration techniques have been proposed for diffusion models more generally. From the perspective of parameter redundancy, researchers have introduced pruning methods such as Diff-Pruning Fang et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ) and LD-Pruner (Castells et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , quantization methods such as PTQ4DM (Shang et\\xa0al., 2023 ) , FPQuant (Zhao et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , and SVDQuant (Li et\\xa0al., 2024a ) , distillation methods such as BK-SDM (Kim et\\xa0al., 2023 ) and CLEAR (Liu et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , sparse attention methods such as DiTFastAttn (Yuan et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Zhang et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , SVG (Xi et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , Sparse-vDiT (Chen et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , and VORTA (Sun et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , and early-stopping strategies such as ES-DDPM (Lyu et\\xa0al., 2022 ) . From the perspective of temporal redundancy, methods like DeepCache (Ma et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , Δ \\\\Delta -DiT (Chen et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , FORA (Selvaraju et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , and TeaCache (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025a ) reuse intermediate features across timesteps (Shen et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Liu et\\xa0al., 2025c ; b ) , while approaches such as LCM (Luo et\\xa0al., 2023 ) and ADD (Sauer et\\xa0al., 2024 ) reduce the number of timesteps through model distillation.\\nFrom the perspective of spatial redundancy, RAS (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025e ) observes that at each diffusion timestep, the model may focus only on semantically coherent regions; therefore, only those regions need to be updated, thereby accelerating image generation. Similarly, ToCa (Zou et\\xa0al., 2024a ) and DuCa (Zou et\\xa0al., 2024b ) note that during denoising, different tokens exhibit varying sensitivities, and dynamically updating only a subset of tokens at each timestep can further accelerate image generation.\\nIn contrast to the methods above, RegionE leverages the trajectory characteristics unique to IIE tasks, while simultaneously addressing both spatial and temporal redundancies in diffusion-based image editing to achieve acceleration.\\nImage Editing. Image editing is an essential task in the field of generative modeling. In the early U-Net (Ronneberger et\\xa0al., 2015 ) era, ControlNet (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2023b ) introduced a robust editing solution through a repeat-structure design. As research advanced, inversion-based methods (Pan et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Wang et\\xa0al., 2025 ) gradually became the dominant approach. These methods apply noise to the original image in the latent space and then recover the edited result through a denoising process. However, this paradigm involves both inversion and denoising stages, which increases complexity. At the same time, IIE models began to emerge. Approaches such as InstructEdit (Wang et\\xa0al., 2023 ) , MagicBrush (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2023a ) , and BrushEdit (Li et\\xa0al., 2024b ) employed modular pipelines, in which large language models generate prompts, spatial cues, or synthetic instruction–image pairs to guide diffusion-based editing. Most of these approaches, however, are task-specific and lack generality. More recently, a new class of IIE has been developed to improve general-purpose editing. These models rely solely on textual instructions, without requiring masks or task-specific designs, and still achieve effective editing performance. Concretely, they leverage MLLMs or advanced text encoders to provide richer semantic control signals, and feed both the target image and noise into a DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2023 ) architecture to enhance image alignment. In this work, we propose an adaptive, region-aware acceleration method for this emerging IIE models.',\n",

This paper, therefore, targets the IIE task and optimizes the inference process of T T iterations in Equation 4 .\\nInstruction-Based Editing Model.

In these models, the velocity field is estimated using Instruction-DiT, the variants of DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2023 ) . The input to Instruction-DiT consists of three types of tokens: text (prompt) tokens 𝑿 P \\\\bm{X}^{P} , noise tokens 𝑿 t i \\\\bm{X}_{t_{i}} , and instruction tokens 𝑿 I \\\\bm{X}^{I} . The noise token corresponds to the generation of the target image, while the text token carries the instruction information. The instruction token is specific to the editing task, representing the part of the image to be edited. Notably, the counts of noise and instruction tokens are roughly comparable and substantially higher than that of text tokens. Temporally, the text and instruction tokens serve as static control signals throughout the denoising process, whereas the noise token evolves dynamically at each timestep. Since Instruction-DiT is designed to predict only the noise component, the model’s output corresponds exclusively to the portion represented by the noise token. To simplify the expression, the Instruction-DiT mentioned below will be referred to simply as DiT.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'This section introduces RegionE, a method that accelerates the IIE model without additional training. The workflow is shown in Figure 3 . RegionE consists of three stages: the Stabilization Stage (STS), the Region-Aware Generation Stage (RAGS), and the Smooth Stage (SMS).\\nStabilization Stage. In the early steps of denoising, the input 𝑿 t i \\\\bm{X}_{t_{i}} to DiT is close to Gaussian noise (i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio is low). This leads to oscillations in DiT’s velocity estimation (see Figure 2 d and 2 e). Since the estimates at this stage are inherently unstable, it is not suitable for acceleration. Therefore, we keep the original sampling process unchanged. Additionally, at the last step of this stage, we save the Key and Value in each attention layer of DiT, denoted as 𝑲 C \\\\bm{K}^{C} and 𝑽 C \\\\bm{V}^{C} .\\nRegion-Aware Generation Stage. This stage is the core component of RegionE and consists of three parts: adaptive region partition, region-aware generation, and adaptive velocity decay cache. The first two parts primarily address spatial redundancy in IIE, while the third further reduces temporal redundancy across timesteps.\\nAdaptive Region Partition. After the stabilization stage, the output of DiT becomes stable. As previously observed, the generation trajectories in the edited regions are curved, whereas those in the unedited regions are straight, as shown in Figure 1 and 2 f. Therefore, for the unedited regions 𝑿 t i U \\\\bm{X}^{U}_{t_{i}} , we can accurately estimate 𝑿 ^ t f U \\\\hat{\\\\bm{X}}^{U}_{t_{f}} at any timestep t f \\u200b ( f < i ) t_{f}(f<i) using one-step estimation:\\nWhen t f = 0 t_{f}=0 , this corresponds to estimating the final unedited regions 𝑿 ^ 0 U \\\\hat{\\\\bm{X}}^{U}_{0} , which is nearly identical to the true 𝑿 0 U \\\\bm{X}_{0}^{U} .\\nHowever, using Equation 5 for the edited region does not accurately estimate 𝑿 ^ 0 E \\\\hat{\\\\bm{X}}^{E}_{0} . Based on this difference between the edited and unedited regions, we propose an adaptive region partition (ARP), as illustrated in the lower-left corner of Figure 3 . Given the velocity 𝒗 t i + 1 \\\\bm{v}_{t_{i+1}} at the beginning of the region-aware generation stage and the noisy image 𝑿 t i \\\\bm{X}_{t_{i}} , the final edited result 𝑿 ^ 0 \\\\hat{\\\\bm{X}}_{0} can be estimated in one step using Equation 5 . This estimate is reliable in unedited regions but less accurate in edited ones.\\nSince the unedited region undergoes minimal change before and after editing, we can compute the cosine similarity between the estimated image 𝑿 0 ^ \\\\hat{\\\\bm{X}_{0}} and the instruction image 𝑿 I \\\\bm{X}^{I} along the token dimension. Regions with sufficiently high similarity ( > > threshold η \\\\eta ), that is, small changes before and after editing, are considered unedited regions, while the remainder is treated as the edited region. To account for potential segmentation noise, morphological opening and closing operations are applied to make the two regions more continuous and accurate.\\nRegion-Aware Generation. After identifying the edited and unedited regions, we apply Equation 5 to the unedited region to directly estimate the denoised image X t f U X^{U}_{t_{f}} at the next timestep t f t_{f} in one step, thereby saving computation for the unedited region. For the edited region, our implementation is as follows: first, the input to DiT is changed from [ 𝑿 P , 𝑿 t i , 𝑿 I ] [\\\\bm{X}^{P},\\\\bm{X}_{t_{i}},\\\\bm{X}^{I}] to [ 𝑿 P , 𝑿 t i E ] [\\\\bm{X}^{P},\\\\bm{X}^{E}_{t_{i}}] , so that DiT only estimates the velocity of the edited region 𝒗 t i E \\\\bm{v}^{E}_{t_{i}} . However, since DiT contains attention layers that involve global token interactions, completely discarding the 𝑿 I \\\\bm{X}^{I} and 𝑿 t i U \\\\bm{X}^{U}_{t_{i}} inputs can gradually inject bias into the estimation of 𝒗 t i E \\\\bm{v}^{E}_{t_{i}} during global attention. To compensate for this loss of information, we propose a Region-Instruction KV Cache (RIKVCache). Specifically, the input to DiT remains [ 𝑿 P , 𝑿 t i E ] [\\\\bm{X}^{P},\\\\bm{X}^{E}_{t_{i}}] , but within the attention layers of DiT, it is modified as follows:\\nThe lower corner labels P P , E E , U U , and I I represent prompt token, edited region token, unedited region token, and instruction token, respectively. The superscript C C in the upper-right corner indicates that the value is taken from the cache of the previous complete computation. And the middle-lower part of Figure 3 visualizes this process. The feasibility of this approach is supported by the high similarity of the KV pairs between consecutive steps, as shown in Figure 2 g and 2 h.\\nAdaptive Velocity Decay Cache. As illustrated in the right part of Figure 1 , although the trajectory of the edited region is curved, the velocities between consecutive timesteps are actually similar. Focusing on the intermediate denoising phase, we observe from Figure 2 e that the velocity directions between adjacent steps are almost identical (cosine similarity approaches 1). At the same time, the magnitudes exhibit a gradual decay that varies across timesteps (Figure 2 d). Based on this observation, we propose an adaptive velocity decay cache (AVDCache). Specifically, the AVDCache introduces a decay factor:\\nHere, ( 1 − Δ \\u200b t t i + 1 , t i ) (1-\\\\Delta t_{t_{i+1},t_{i}}) represents the sample-aware component under discrete Euler solver, while γ t i \\\\gamma_{t_{i}} represents the timestep-aware component. The solver entirely determines the former, while the latter is obtained by fitting on a randomly sampled dataset. Since the decay factor in Eq. 7 characterizes the intrinsic differences between diffusion model timesteps, we introduce the AVDCache criterion:\\nHere, t s t_{s} and t e t_{e} denote the start and end timesteps of the cache, respectively, while the criterion measures the cumulative error of this process. The decision of whether to apply the cache is made using a threshold δ \\\\delta . The complete process is as follows:\\nThe right-lower part of Figure 3 visualizes this process.\\nIn fact, AVDCache is an improved version of the existing residual cache methods, with further details and analysis provided in the supplementary.\\nAfter the above process, we obtain the generated results for both the edited and unedited regions. We then re-gather these results according to their spatial positions to reconstruct the complete image tokens.\\nIt is worth noting that the similarity of the KV Cache decreases as the timestep increases. To address this issue, we periodically enforce full-image gathering at certain timesteps within the region-aware generation stage, performing a complete DiT computation to update the RIKVCache.\\nSmooth Stage. Small gaps may appear at the boundaries between edited and unedited regions after stitching. Although these gaps are often imperceptible in most cases, to ensure the generality of our method, we perform several steps of unaccelerated denoising on the merged full image to smooth these discontinuities. Empirically, two denoising steps are sufficient to eliminate the gaps effectively.',\n",

Step1X-Edit adopts a CFG (classifier-free guidance) (Ho & Salimans, 2022 ) scale of 6, FLUX.1 Kontext uses a scale of 2.5, and Qwen-Image-Edit applies a scale of 4. All models are evaluated with 28 sampling steps. For evaluation, we follow the dataset protocols described in the respective technical reports. Specifically, we use 606 image prompt pairs covering 11 tasks from GEdit-Bench English (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025d ) for Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, and 1026 image prompt pairs spanning five tasks from KontextBench (Labs et\\xa0al., 2025 ) for FLUX.1 Kontext.\\nEvaluation Metrics. We design a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess both the quality and efficiency of IIE models. For quality assessment, we adopt two complementary approaches. First, we evaluate reconstruction quality by measuring deviations before and after acceleration, using PSNR (Zhao et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , SSIM (Wang & Bovik, 2002 ) , and LPIPS (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2018 ) as metrics. Second, we conduct an editing evaluation using vision–language models (VLMs), specifically GPT-4o, to assess image quality, semantic alignment, and overall performance (Ku et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , as shown in Table 1 . Evaluation dimensions are denoted by the suffixes SC, PQ, and O, consistent with (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025d ) and (Wu et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . For efficiency evaluation, we report actual runtime latency as well as the relative speedup compared to the vanilla pretrained models.\\nBaseline. Currently, there are no acceleration methods designed explicitly for IIEmodels. Therefore, we adapt several effective acceleration techniques initially developed for diffusion models as baselines, since they are also applicable to diffusion-based IIE tasks. From the perspective of timestep redundancy, Steoskip performs larger jumps in the sampling steps, FORA (Selvaraju et\\xa0al., 2024 ) employs block-level cache, and Δ \\\\Delta -DiT (Chen et\\xa0al., 2024 ) and TeaCache (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025a ) use residual cache. From the perspective of spatial redundancy, RAS (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025e ) and ToCa (Zou et\\xa0al., 2024a ) perform redundancy-reduction denoising at the token level.\\nImplementation Details. For all three models, RegionE uses six steps in the stabilization stage, enforces an update at step 16 in the region-aware generation stage, and adopts two steps in the smooth stage. For Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit, the segmentation thresholds η \\\\eta of ARP are 0.88, 0.93, and 0.80, respectively, while the decision thresholds δ \\\\delta of AVDCache are 0.02, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively. Latency is measured on a single NVIDIA H800 GPU, with each run editing one image at a time.\\nWe evaluate RegionE against several state-of-the-art acceleration methods on three prominent IIE models: Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. Our evaluation encompasses quantitative metrics, efficiency measurements, and visualization, demonstrating that RegionE achieves a superior balance between acceleration and quality preservation. The quantitative results are shown in Table 1 . Since both GEdit-Bench and KontextBench involve multiple editing tasks, the table reports results averaged over tasks, while the per-task quantitative results are provided in the supplementary.\\nDeviation Analysis Compared to Pre-trained Models. The ”Against Vanilla” evaluation reveals RegionE’s exceptional fidelity to original model outputs across all evaluation metrics, significantly outperforming competing acceleration methods. RegionE achieves the highest PSNR values: 30.520 dB (Step1X-Edit), 32.133 dB (FLUX.1 Kontext), and 31.115 dB (Qwen-Image-Edit), representing substantial improvements of 2-4 dB over the next-best methods, indicating minimal pixel-level deviation from the original outputs. The SSIM scores of 0.939, 0.917, and 0.937 demonstrate superior preservation of structural coherence across different model architectures.

This consistent performance across three diverse model architectures validates RegionE’s architectural agnosticism. RegionE consistently maintains stable, high-quality results.\\nGPT-4o Editing Quality Assessment. The GPT-4o evaluation provides additional quality validation through automated semantic and perceptual analysis across three dimensions, consistently demonstrating RegionE’s superior performance. For semantic consistency (G-SC), RegionE achieves scores of 7.552, 7.278, and 8.242, matching or exceeding original models while maintaining substantial acceleration, with Qwen-Image-Edit showing perfect preservation (8.242) despite 2.059× speedup. The perceptual quality (G-PQ) scores of 7.405, 6.953, and 7.968 consistently outperform competing acceleration methods by 0.1 to 0.3 points, demonstrating the practical preservation of visual coherence through region-aware processing. Overall quality (G-O) scores of 6.948, 6.538, and 7.731 provide holistic assessment validation, with the alignment between GPT-4o assessments and quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) strengthening confidence in RegionE’s comprehensive quality preservation across multiple evaluation dimensions and providing additional evidence of the hybrid temporal-spatial optimization approach’s effectiveness.\\nEfficiency Analysis. RegionE demonstrates substantial efficiency gains while maintaining superior quality, achieving an optimal balance between acceleration and performance preservation with impressive results across all evaluated models. The method achieves speedups of 2.572×, 2.409×, and 2.059× across Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit respectively, translating to significant absolute latency reductions: from 27.945s to 10.865s, from 14.682s to 6.096s, and from 32.125s to 15.604s respectively. RegionE occupies the optimal position on the efficiency-quality curve, maintaining the highest quality metrics while achieving competitive or superior acceleration compared to methods that sacrifice substantial quality for higher speedups.\\nVisualization. Figure 4 presents partial visualizations of different acceleration methods on Step1X-Edit. Among the baselines, RegionE produces edited outputs closest to the vanilla setting at higher speedups, preserving both details and contours. The last column shows ARP predictions of spatial regions in RegionE, where unedited regions are masked. These masked regions closely match human perception. Additional visualizations for other tasks and models are provided in the supplementary.\\nThe experimental results conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of RegionE in addressing both spatial and temporal redundancies in IIE models. RegionE achieves superior quality preservation metrics while maintaining competitive acceleration. The consistent improvements across diverse model architectures validate the generalizability of the underlying insights about regional editing patterns and temporal similarities in diffusion-based IIE processes.\\nWe conduct ablation studies to investigate the contributions of different components in RegionE, primarily on the Step1X-Edit-v1p1. The quantitative results are summarized in Table 2 .\\nCache Design. We propose two key components: RIKVCache and AVDCache. Removing RIKVCache, i.e., performing local attention within the edited region without injecting instruction information or context from the unedited region, results in a 2.734× speed-up. However, this comes at a significant cost to editing quality, with PSNR dropping from 30.520 to 22.868 and G-O decreasing from 6.948 to 5.191. This demonstrates that global context supervision is crucial even during region generation. In contrast, removing AVDCache results in a slight improvement in editing quality (G-O increases from 6.948 to 7.023), but without eliminating redundancy across timesteps, the acceleration is limited to 1.733. This indicates that AVDCache significantly improves inference efficiency with minimal degradation in quality.\\nStage Design. We introduce two auxiliary stages: Stabilization Stage (STS) and Smooth Stage (SMS), as well as a forced step in the region-aware generation stage (RAGS). Removing STS causes substantial drops in editing quality (PSNR: 30.520 → 21.441, LPIPS: 0.054 → 0.161, G-O: 6.948 → 6.325). As discussed in Section 4 , STS addresses the instability in speed estimation, and skipping it results in degraded performance. Removing SMS leads to smaller declines in both pixel-level (PSNR: 30.520 → 28.857, SSIM: 0.939 → 0.904) and perceptual metrics (G-O: 6.948 → 6.773), reflecting its role in bridging the gap between edited and unedited regions. Finally, when the forced step in RAGS was removed, since its role was to mitigate the decay of KV similarity over time, its removal led to a 2-point drop in PSNR, further validating its necessity.',\n",

Step1X-Edit adopts a CFG (classifier-free guidance) (Ho & Salimans, 2022 ) scale of 6, FLUX.1 Kontext uses a scale of 2.5, and Qwen-Image-Edit applies a scale of 4. All models are evaluated with 28 sampling steps. For evaluation, we follow the dataset protocols described in the respective technical reports. Specifically, we use 606 image prompt pairs covering 11 tasks from GEdit-Bench English (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025d ) for Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, and 1026 image prompt pairs spanning five tasks from KontextBench (Labs et\\xa0al., 2025 ) for FLUX.1 Kontext.\\nEvaluation Metrics. We design a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess both the quality and efficiency of IIE models. For quality assessment, we adopt two complementary approaches. First, we evaluate reconstruction quality by measuring deviations before and after acceleration, using PSNR (Zhao et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , SSIM (Wang & Bovik, 2002 ) , and LPIPS (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2018 ) as metrics. Second, we conduct an editing evaluation using vision–language models (VLMs), specifically GPT-4o, to assess image quality, semantic alignment, and overall performance (Ku et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , as shown in Table 1 . Evaluation dimensions are denoted by the suffixes SC, PQ, and O, consistent with (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025d ) and (Wu et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . For efficiency evaluation, we report actual runtime latency as well as the relative speedup compared to the vanilla pretrained models.\\nBaseline. Currently, there are no acceleration methods designed explicitly for IIEmodels. Therefore, we adapt several effective acceleration techniques initially developed for diffusion models as baselines, since they are also applicable to diffusion-based IIE tasks. From the perspective of timestep redundancy, Steoskip performs larger jumps in the sampling steps, FORA (Selvaraju et\\xa0al., 2024 ) employs block-level cache, and Δ \\\\Delta -DiT (Chen et\\xa0al., 2024 ) and TeaCache (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025a ) use residual cache. From the perspective of spatial redundancy, RAS (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025e ) and ToCa (Zou et\\xa0al., 2024a ) perform redundancy-reduction denoising at the token level.\\nImplementation Details. For all three models, RegionE uses six steps in the stabilization stage, enforces an update at step 16 in the region-aware generation stage, and adopts two steps in the smooth stage. For Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit, the segmentation thresholds η \\\\eta of ARP are 0.88, 0.93, and 0.80, respectively, while the decision thresholds δ \\\\delta of AVDCache are 0.02, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively.

This motivates us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition.\\n We observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step.\\n Therefore, in the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation.

Traditionally, CPT E/M coding is performed by physicians and trained human coders who review clinical encounter notes and electronic health record (EHR) data to assign appropriate codes. They often rely on detailed guidelines American Medical Association ( 2023 ) to navigate the complexity of Medical Decision Making (MDM) for a given encounter. However, this manual process is resource-intensive, prone to inconsistencies due to variation in coder’s expertise, and vulnerable to errors arising from intricate coding guidelines and the nuanced nature of clinical reasoning.\\nMany studies highlight the financial and compliance ramifications of coding inaccuracies. For example, the U.S. Office of Inspector General (OIG) estimated that in 2010, Medicare inappropriately paid US$6.7 billion (21% of total E/M payments) due to incorrect coding and/or insufficient documentation; 42% of claims were miscoded and 19% lacked proper documentation U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office of Inspector\\nGeneral ( 2014 ) . A Florida-specific analysis estimated that nearly 9% of primary care visits (2.6 million annually) were undercoded, resulting in approximately US$114 million in lost revenue for hospitals Tenpas and Dietrich ( 2023 ) . These findings underscore both widespread inconsistency and the high cost of coding errors.\\nAutomation of CPT E/M coding offers several compelling advantages, including reducing human error through consistent application of complex coding rules, achieving scalable efficiency by handling high-volume chart reviews without increasing workload on physicians and coders, enhancing timely revenue capture by improved turnaround time. Additionally, automated coding can provide transparent and traceable reasoning, crucial for audits and compliance risk mitigation and enhance coding consistency, and optimizes coder resources by allowing human coders to focus on more complex or ambiguous cases. Beyond its immediate healthcare impact, CPT E/M coding exemplifies a broader class of problems where models must map free-text to codified decisions under strict guideline constraints. Insights from this work therefore extend to other regulated domains that require auditable, rule-aligned predictions.\\nIn this paper, we share our practical experience in developing and deploying ProFees, an automated CPT E/M coding model within a production EHR system. Development of ProFees provides solutions to five main complexities of real-world E/M coding, summarized in Table 1 . Leveraging advanced large language model (LLM) techniques, ProFees employs a dynamic few-shot prompting strategy to align coding decisions with best practices contextually relevant to each patients’ encounter notes. Furthermore, an LLM-based critic is integrated to validate reasoning across the MDM elements explicitly, ensuring robust and explainable outcomes. To mitigate the stochasticity inherent in generative models, ProFees also adopts a self-consistency strategy to achieve reliable and consistent coding predictions.\\nThis paper’s key contributions include:\\nDevelopment and deployment of ProFees, a sophisticated LLM-based framework employing dynamic few-shot prompting, explicit criticism, and self-consistency techniques for accurate CPT E/M coding and intermediate MDM level estimation.\\nEmpirical demonstration of ProFees’s efficacy on a proprietary test dataset 2 2 2 This test set was meticulously annotated by our internal expert in the same way as the development set of 117 encounters.

       "    'paragraphs': 'CPT E/M coding involves assigning standardized billing codes based on the type and complexity of the patient encounter. In this work, we focus on outpatient and preventive medicine encounters. Figure 1 illustrates the decision process used by human coders, starting from determining the encounter type, followed by key branching logic such as whether the patient is new or established, and finally selecting the appropriate CPT code based on either the Medical Decision Making (MDM) level or the patient age group.\\nAmong these branches, determining the MDM level is the most complex and error-prone step. MDM is assessed across three elements: (1) the number and complexity of problems addressed during patient visit, (2) the amount and/or complexity of data reviewed and analyzed, and (3) the risk of complications and/or morbidity or mortality. The final MDM level is determined using a 2-out-of-3 rule, that at least two of the three elements must meet the criteria for a given complexity level (i.e. “straightforward”, “low”, “moderate”, or “high”).\\nThis process requires structured clinical reasoning. For instance, for the “problems addressed” element, distinguishing between “stable, chronic illness” (i.e. “low” complexity) and “chronic illnesses with exacerbation, progression, or side effects of treatment” (i.e. “moderate” complexity) depends on close reading of clinical descriptions and inferred disease trajectories. Similarly, assessing the “data complexity” element may involve identifying whether documentation reflects “ordering unique test(s)” or “independent interpretation of tests”, which can elevate the data complexity from “low” to “moderate” or “extensive”. See Appendix A for a full view of the 2024 edition of MDM guidelines used for developing ProFees\\nand Appendix F for a synthetic example.\\nIn this paper, we report only strict exact-match accuracy, as payers adjudicate at the code level and incorrect CPT E/M codes may be denied, downcoded, or adjusted, affecting reimbursement timelines. Near-miss codes do not change clinical care (E/M is a billing construct), but they have operational and financial implications: miscoding can trigger denials and rework; systematic overcoding increases legal/compliance risk despite any short-term gain; systematic undercoding reduces revenue and understates provider workload. In addition, although business outcomes, e.g., revenue uplift, are ultimately important, they are much harder to be attributed directly to CPT E/M code choices due to other down-the-line factors, such as diagnosis–procedure linkage, billing completeness, payer-specific rules, and documentation quality. We therefore focus our evaluation on exact-match accuracy.',\n",

Therefore, our model is designed to predict the two remaining components: encounter type and MDM level. The initial MDM prediction is further refined through a Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI) process Kim et\\xa0al. ( 2023a ) to ensure guideline compliance. The outputs of both classifiers are then combined and processed by a downstream rule-based decision tree to produce the final CPT E/M code together with the corresponding justification.\\nOur model design reflects iterative failure analysis in collaboration with medical coders, addressing limitations of early monolithic prompt architectures that lacked interpretability, guideline adherence, and reliability. By modularizing prediction, reasoning, and validation, the system ensures contextual relevance through retrieval-augmented prompting, enforces compliance via recursive self-critique, and reduces hallucination by rule-based logic (e.g., majority voting, 2-out-of-3 CPT rules) to deterministic decision trees.

The initial prediction leverages dynamic few-shot prompting with external annotated examples retrieved from a Vector Database (VDB), the content of which consist of justifications and reasoning steps that were curated and validated by human coding experts to align with MDM guidelines.

       "    'paragraphs': 'While ProFees demonstrates a significant improvement in CPT E/M coding accuracy, its integration into EHR systems requires careful consideration of several key ethical issues to ensure its responsible deployment.\\nPrivacy and data integrity. Our development and evaluation efforts were conducted in a secure, HIPAA-compliant environment. As mentioned in Section 5 , the development of ProFees utilize de-identified real-patient data. For deployment, ProFees will be deployed in a secure cloud environment with state-of-the-art safeguards to ensure patient confidentiality.\\nAccountability and liability. Automating clinical coding may introduce ambiguity on accountability for coding errors. Ultimately, ProFees acts as an assistive tool, but not an autonomous decision-making tool, that helps physicians and professional coders, who take the final responsibility.\\nAlgorithmic biases and fairness. Our model was tuned and evaluated on a small-scale real-world dataset, which may contain latent biases. Thus, there is a risk that the model could learn (e.g. through few-shot examples) to systematically assign different CPT E/M codes based on patterns in encounter notes correlated with patient demographics (e.g. race and gender). To mitigate this risk, we are curating a synthetic dataset to enable targeted evaluation of model behaviors.\\nInterpretability and transparency. Trust in a healthcare setting demands interpretability. While frontier LLMs are often considered blackboxes, we have developed ProFees to improve its interpretability. Specifically, through carefully designed prompts and architecture, we elicit sophisticated, multi-step reasoning from LLMs, leverage both internal and external clinical coding knowledge, and generate detailed rationales for coding outputs. This interpretability is not only crucial for gaining user trust and enabling human oversight, but also providing clear rationales for external audits.\\nAutomation bias and human oversight. ProFees’ strong performance (a > 30 >30 -point accuracy improvement) may create a risk of automation bias . Specifically, it is plausible that human users might develop a degree of reliance higher than what is warranted. ProFees generates detailed rationales that justify suggested codes. The UI/UX and workflow design should enable and facilitate human review of the codes and corresponding rationales.

However, a number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a systematic evaluation.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Research into non-learning-based decision-making algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Browne et\\xa0al., 2012 ; Kocsis & Szepesvári, 2006 ) is an active field. On the one hand MCTS can be used for applications where a general on-the-fly applicable decision-making algorithm is needed such as Game Studios which rarely use Machine Learning (ML) based AI as they would have to be retrained whenever the game rules are modified (e.g. during development or patches). And on the other hand, though not the scope of this paper, foundational work in MCTS might potentially translate to improvements of ML algorithms such as Alpha Zero (Silver et\\xa0al., 2017 ) that are built on MCTS.\\nOne way to improve MCTS is to reduce the search space by grouping states and actions in the current MCTS search tree to enable an intra-layer information flow (Jiang et\\xa0al., 2014 ; Anand et\\xa0al., 2015 ; 2016 ) by averaging the visits and returns of all abstract action nodes in the same abstract node used for the Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) formula in the tree policy, which increases the sample efficiency.\\nOne key strength of one of the state-of-the-art abstraction algorithms On the Go Abstractions in Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) (Anand et\\xa0al., 2016 ) is its exactness in the sense that if OGA-UCT groups two state-action pairs in a search tree where all possible successors of each state-action pair have been sampled, only state-action pairs are grouped that have the same Q ∗ Q^{*} value, i.e., they have the same value under subsequent optimal play. This exactness condition, however, comes at the cost that state or state-action pairs that only differ slightly in their Q ∗ Q^{*} value cannot be detected. This issue was slightly alleviated with the introduction of ( ε a , ε t ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}) -OGA (Schmöcker et\\xa0al., 2025c ) , which is equivalent to ( ε a , 0 ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},0) -OGA in deterministic environments that allows for small errors in the immediate reward or transition function when building an abstraction. However, this also brings two downsides with it. Firstly, it introduces two parameters, which makes tuning harder, and secondly, grouping non-value equivalent state-action pairs might even be harmful to the performance, as they can make convergence to the optimal action impossible.\\nIn this work we propose Known Value Differences Abstractions UCT (KVDA-UCT), that relaxes the strict abstraction conditions of OGA-UCT to detect almost as many abstractions as ( ε a , 0 ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},0) -OGA in deterministic environments but without losing the exactness condition. The novel idea that makes this possible is to deliberately group states or state-action pairs that do not have the same value if we know the difference between their values which is inferred by analysis of the search tree’s immediate rewards. When the abstractions are used, instead of averaging state-action pair values directly, their difference-accounted values are averaged.\\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\\n1. We introduce the Known-Value-Difference (KVDA) abstraction framework that extends the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework used by OGA-UCT. Fig. 1 is an example of a simple state-transition graph in which KVDA finds three non-trivial abstractions, while ASAP would detect none.\\n2. We propose and empirically evaluate KVDA-UCT, a modification of OGA-UCT that introduces no parameters and uses and builds KVDA abstractions. We show that KVDA-UCT outperforms OGA-UCT in most of the here-considered deterministic environments. We also compare KVDA-UCT with ( ε a , 0 ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},0) -OGA and show that it either performs equally well or better than a parameter-optimized ( ε a , 0 ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},0) -OGA agent.\\n3. We also consider the stochastic setting where we generalize KVDA-UCT to ε t \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}} -KVDA which allows for errors in the transition function when building the abstraction. Furthermore, we compare it to ( ε t , ε a ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}}) -OGA and show that, unlike in the deterministic setting, KVDA rarely performs better than ( ε t , ε a ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}}) -OGA in stochastic environments.\\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 , the theoretical groundwork for automatic state and state-action pair abstractions is laid. In particular, we define OGA-UCT and ( ε a , ε t ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}) -OGA. Then, in Section 3 , our novel KVDA framework and both KVDA-UCT and ε t \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}} -KVDA are introduced. Afterwards, in Section 4 , the experimental setup is defined, then in Section 5 , the experimental results using this setup are shown and discussed. The paper is concluded by a discussion of the limitations of KVDA-UCT and avenues for future work in Section 6 .',\n",

In general, by abstractions of either the states of state-action-pairs we refer to equivalence relations over the state set S S or state-action pair set P P . The equivalence classes are abstract states or state-action pairs.\\nThe current state of the art is the Abstraction of State-Action Pairs in UCT (ASAP) abstraction framework (Anand et\\xa0al., 2015 ) that proposes rules to detect value-equivalent states and state-action pairs given an MDP transition graph and applies it to the current MCTS search graph (for details on MCTS, see Section A.7 ). The core idea of ASAP is to alternatingly construct a state abstraction given a state-action pair abstraction and a state-action pair abstraction given a state abstraction.\\nAssume one is given a state abstraction ℰ ′ ⊆ S × S \\\\mathcal{E}^{\\\\prime}\\\\subseteq S\\\\times S . The corresponding ASAP state-action pair abstraction ℋ ⊆ P × P \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\subseteq P\\\\times P is defined as grouping those state-action pairs with the same immediate reward and equal abstract successor distribution. Concretely,\\nany state-action-pair ( s 1 , a 1 ) , ( s 2 , a 2 ) (s_{1},a_{1}),(s_{2},a_{2}) is equivalent i.e. ( ( s 1 , a 1 ) , ( s 2 , a 2 ) ) ∈ ℋ ((s_{1},a_{1}),(s_{2},a_{2}))\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H} if and only if\\nwhere 𝒳 \\\\mathcal{X} are the equivalence classes of ℰ ′ \\\\mathcal{E}^{\\\\prime} . And given a state-action pair abstraction ℋ ′ ⊆ P × P \\\\mathcal{H}^{\\\\prime}\\\\subseteq P\\\\times P , the corresponding ASAP state abstraction ℰ \\\\mathcal{E} groups all states whose actions can be mapped to each other, concretely:\\nTo obtain the ASAP abstraction for a given MDP, these two constructing steps are repeated alternatingly until convergence.\\nOGA-UCT: Anand et\\xa0al. ( 2016 ) proposed OGA-UCT, which builds an ASAP-like abstraction in parallel to running MCTS. When building the abstraction OGA starts with the initial state abstraction that groups all terminal states of the same layer and puts the remaining states in their own singleton equivalence class. Furthermore, when building the ASAP abstraction on the current search graph, OGA ignores non-yet-sampled successors of state-action pairs that appear in Equation 2 . To make the frequent recomputation of the ASAP abstraction feasible, OGA keeps track of a recency counter for each Q-node and once it surpasses a certain threshold, recomputes its abstraction. If the abstraction changed, the parent states are recomputed too (and possibly their Q-node parents if their abstraction changed). By only locally checking for errors in the abstraction, OGA is able to keep track of an ASAP-like abstraction that is always close to the true ASAP abstraction of the current search tree.\\nThe only MCTS component that OGA-UCT affects is the tree policy which is enhanced by using the aggregate returns and visits of a Q-node’s abstract node to enhance the UCB value. ( 𝜺 a , 𝜺 t ) \\\\bm{(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}})} -OGA : The ASAP framework groups only value equivalent states and state-action pairs. This condition can be relaxed like already done by a predecessor of OGA-UCT, called AS-UCT (Jiang et\\xa0al., 2014 ) , by allowing the rewards in Equation 1 to differ by some threshold ε a > 0 \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}}>0 and the transition error F t F_{\\\\text{t}} of Equation 1 to lie in the interval [ 0 , ε t ] [0,\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}] where 0 ≤ ε t ≤ 2 0\\\\leq\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}\\\\leq 2 is another parameter which does not have any effect in deterministic environments . Since in general, positive threshold values do not induce an equivalence relation over state-action pairs, OGA-UCT has to be slightly modified to accommodate these approximate abstractions. This has been done by Schmöcker and Dockhorn (Schmöcker et\\xa0al., 2025c ) who introduced ( ε a , ε t ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}) -OGA.\\nAuther automatic abstraction algorithm: The ASAP framework is the direct successor of Abstraction of States (AS) by Jiang et\\xa0al. ( 2014 ) that abstracts states if and only if their actions are pairwise similar in the sense that Equation 2 only has to be approximately satisfied as described in the ( ε a , ε t ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}) -OGA section above. While this paper focuses on deterministic domains, ( ε a , ε t ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}) -OGA (and related algorithms) have been further improved for stochastic settings by defining intra-abstraction policies (Schmöcker et\\xa0al., 2025b ) , or dynamically abandoning the abstraction (Xu et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Schmöcker et\\xa0al., 2025c ) .\\nYet another paradigm is demonstrated by Hostetler et\\xa0al. ( 2015 ) and Schmöcker et\\xa0al. ( 2025a ) who optimistically construct abstractions by starting with a very coarse abstraction (e.g. grouping everything together) and then they refine this abstraction, for example by repeatedly splitting large node groups in half (Hostetler et\\xa0al., 2015 ) .\\nResearch effort has also been dedicated towards automatic abstractions of the transition function, which on an abstract level can be described as pruning certain successors from the transition function (Sokota et\\xa0al., 2021 ; Yoon et\\xa0al., 2008 ; 2007 ; Saisubramanian et\\xa0al., 2017 ) .',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'This section introduces our novel KVDA-UCT algorithm. First, we will provide an example of a concrete search graph in which ASAP misses abstractions that the Known Value Differences Abstractions (KVDA) framework would find which will be introduced after the search graph example. At the end of this section, we will be describing how KVDA is integrated into UCT to yield KVDA-UCT.\\nConsider the state-transition graph that is illustrated in Fig. 1 that consists of four states and four actions. The ASAP framework would not detect any equivalences. In fact, any framework that aims at finding value-equivalent states or state-action pairs would at most be able to detect that the two root actions are value-equivalent.\\nHowever, by analysing the state graph, one could derive that the Q ∗ Q^{*} values of the action of node 2 differs only by 1 1 from the Q ∗ Q^{*} value of the action of node 3 3 . This holds true even if the state-graph would extend past node 4 4 . Consequently, the V ∗ V^{*} values of nodes 2 and 3 differ only by 1 1 . This in turn implies that the two actions of node 1 must have the same Q ∗ Q^{*} value. This is the core idea behind our Known-Value-Difference-Abstractions (KVDA) framework which is to abstract states and state-action pairs if one can derive their value differences. Later, when using these abstractions to enhance MCTS, the differences only have to be subtracted when aggregating values. When viewed from the lenses of the KVDA framework, ASAP only groups states or state-action pairs with a value difference of 0 , i.e. detects only true equivalences.\\nNext, we will formalize the KVDA framework which both in theory and in our empirical evaluations (see Tab. 1 , more details are given in the experimental section) detects strictly more abstractions.\\nOur method, the Known-Value-Difference-Abstractions (KVDA) extends the ASAP definition by additionally grouping states or state-action-pairs whose V ∗ V^{*} or Q ∗ Q^{*} difference is known. While ASAP iteratively builds abstractions on abstractions, KVDA bootstraps of an abstraction, difference-function pair. More concretely, given a state abstraction ℰ ′ \\\\mathcal{E}^{\\\\prime} (or a state-action pair abstraction ℋ ′ \\\\mathcal{H}^{\\\\prime} ) and a difference function d s ′ : S × S ↦ ℝ d_{\\\\text{s}}^{\\\\prime}\\\\colon S\\\\times S\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} (or d a ′ : P × P ↦ ℝ d_{\\\\text{a}}^{\\\\prime}\\\\colon P\\\\times P\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} ), both a state-action-pair abstraction ℋ \\\\mathcal{H} (or a state abstraction ℰ \\\\mathcal{E} ) is produced as well as a state-action pair difference function d a : P × P ↦ ℝ d_{\\\\text{a}}\\\\colon P\\\\times P\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} (or a state difference function d s : S × S ↦ ℝ d_{\\\\text{s}}\\\\colon S\\\\times S\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} ). Both d a d_{\\\\text{a}} and d s d_{\\\\text{s}} will be constructed such that\\nfor any pair of states or state-action pairs in the same equivalence class (i.e., in the same abstract state). Even though in the experimental section, we will mostly consider deterministic environments, the now-to-be-described KVDA framework will be applicable to any MDP, including stochastic ones.\\nNext, starting with the base case, we will formalize how KVDA abstractions are built. The base case: Like ASAP, KVDA groups all terminal states into the same initial abstract node, the remaining states are singleton abstract nodes. The difference function between all nodes in the terminal abstract node is initialized with 0 . State-action-pair abstractions: Using the same notation as in Section 2 , let ℰ ′ ⊆ S × S \\\\mathcal{E}^{\\\\prime}\\\\subseteq S\\\\times S be a state abstraction and d s ′ : S × S ↦ ℝ d_{\\\\text{s}}^{\\\\prime}\\\\colon S\\\\times S\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} be a difference function. The corresponding KVDA state-action pair abstraction ℋ ⊆ P × P \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\subseteq P\\\\times P is defined as follows:\\nAny state-action pair ( s 1 , a 1 ) , ( s 2 , a 2 ) (s_{1},a_{1}),(s_{2},a_{2}) is equivalent i.e. ( ( s 1 , a 1 ) , ( s 2 , a 2 ) ) ∈ ℋ ((s_{1},a_{1}),(s_{2},a_{2}))\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H} if and only if\\nwhere 𝒳 \\\\mathcal{X} are the equivalence classes of ℰ ′ \\\\mathcal{E}^{\\\\prime} . Note that this is almost identical to the ASAP definition except that the immediate rewards do not have to coincide. The difference function d a : P × P ↦ ℝ d_{\\\\text{a}}\\\\colon P\\\\times P\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} for two ( p 1 , p 2 ) ∈ ℋ (p_{1},p_{2})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H} is given by\\nwhere for each x ∈ 𝒳 x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X} , s x s_{x} is an arbitrarily chosen but fixed representative of 𝒳 \\\\mathcal{X} . We will later see that the value of d a d_{\\\\text{a}} is independent of this choice.

It is first checked that within s 1 s_{1} (and analogously s 2 s_{2} ) all actions within the same abstract node have a value difference of zero.

       "      'paragraphs': 'Consider the state-transition graph that is illustrated in Fig. 1 that consists of four states and four actions. The ASAP framework would not detect any equivalences. In fact, any framework that aims at finding value-equivalent states or state-action pairs would at most be able to detect that the two root actions are value-equivalent.\\nHowever, by analysing the state graph, one could derive that the Q ∗ Q^{*} values of the action of node 2 differs only by 1 1 from the Q ∗ Q^{*} value of the action of node 3 3 . This holds true even if the state-graph would extend past node 4 4 . Consequently, the V ∗ V^{*} values of nodes 2 and 3 differ only by 1 1 . This in turn implies that the two actions of node 1 must have the same Q ∗ Q^{*} value. This is the core idea behind our Known-Value-Difference-Abstractions (KVDA) framework which is to abstract states and state-action pairs if one can derive their value differences. Later, when using these abstractions to enhance MCTS, the differences only have to be subtracted when aggregating values. When viewed from the lenses of the KVDA framework, ASAP only groups states or state-action pairs with a value difference of 0 , i.e. detects only true equivalences.\\nNext, we will formalize the KVDA framework which both in theory and in our empirical evaluations (see Tab. 1 , more details are given in the experimental section) detects strictly more abstractions.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'In this section, we describe the general experiment setup. Any deviations from this setup will be explicitly mentioned.\\nProblem models: For this paper, we ran our experiments on a variety of MDPs, all of which are either from the International Probabilistic Planning Conference (Grzes et\\xa0al., 2014 ) , are well-known board games, or are commonly used in the abstraction algorithm literature. Since we will compare KVDA-UCT to OGA-UCT we chose only environments with a non-constant and non-sparse reward function, as constant reward environments would imply that KVDA-UCT and OGA-UCT are semantically equivalent.\\nAll MDPs originally feature stochasticity, however, for some experiments we considered their deterministic versions which are obtained by sampling a single successor of each state-action pair. For each episode, new successors are sampled.\\nAll experiments were run on the finite horizon versions of the considered MDPs with a default horizon of 50 steps and 200 for the board games with a planning horizon of 50 and a discount factor γ = 1 \\\\gamma=1 .\\nThe board games are transformed into MDPs by inserting a deterministic One-Step-Lookahead agent as the opponent. Furthermore, since they are all sparse-reward (i.e. either win or lose) they were also transformed into dense-reward MDPs by using heuristics. For each board game we defined a heuristic V h V^{\\\\text{h}} that assigns each state a heuristic value for its state value. The reward of the (deterministic) transition s , a , s ′ s,a,s^{\\\\prime} is then given by V h \\u200b ( s ′ ) − V h \\u200b ( s ) V^{\\\\text{h}}(s^{\\\\prime})-V^{\\\\text{h}}(s) . The concrete heuristics used along with a brief description of all MDPs is provided in the supplementary materials in Section A.8 . The deterministic MDPs are denoted by adding the prefix d- and the stochastic ones are denoted by the prefix s- .\\nParameters: Since the problem domains have vastly different reward scales, we use the dynamic exploration factor Global Std (Schmöcker et\\xa0al., 2025d ) which has the form C ⋅ σ C\\\\cdot\\\\sigma where σ \\\\sigma is the standard deviation of the Q values of all nodes in the search tree and C ∈ ℝ + C\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{+} is some fixed parameter. Furthermore, we always use K = 3 K=3 as the recency counter which was proposed by Anand et\\xa0al.

This is the same score as used in Schmöcker et\\xa0al. ( 2025d ) . The pairings score is constructed as follows. Let { π 1 , … , π n } \\\\{\\\\pi_{1},\\\\dots,\\\\pi_{n}\\\\} be n n agents (e.g. each KVDA-UCT agent along with its parameter setting is an agent) where each agent was evaluated on m m tasks (later, a task will be a given MCTS iteration budget and an environment).

       "    'paragraphs': 'This section presents the experimental results of KVDA-UCT. We considered two settings. Firstly, in Section 5 we measured the number of additional abstractions KVDA-UCT finds in comparison to OGA-UCT. Then, we evaluated KVDA-UCT on deterministic settings in which the losslessness of the abstraction is guaranteed in Section 1 and Section 2 . Lastly, we present the results for stochastic environments in Section 3 .\\nAbstractions that KVDA-UCT finds but OGA-UCT does not: Firstly, we empirically measured the number of non-trivial abstractions (i.e. those that aren’t of size one) that KVDA-UCT, OGA-UCT, and ( ∞ , 0 ) (\\\\infty,0) -UCT find. For all deterministic environments, Tab. 1 denotes the average ratio of non-trivial abstract state-action pairs (synonymously abstract Q nodes) to the number of total abstract Q nodes in their respective search trees. In most environments, KVDA-UCT detects more abstractions than OGA-UCT, including environments where the abstraction rate more than doubles, such as SysAdmin or Wildfire. Furthermore, KVDA-UCT detects roughly as many abstractions as ( ∞ , 0 ) (\\\\infty,0) -OGA in most environments, which fully ignores rewards when building abstractions.\\nParameter-optimized KVDA-UCT: Next, we compared KVDA-UCT, ( 0 , 0 ) (0,0) -OGA (i.e. standard OGA-UCT), and ( ε a , 0 ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},0) -OGA with ε a > 0 \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}}>0 in terms of their parameter-optimized performances on deterministic environments.\\nFor all methods, we optimized over C ∈ { 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 } C\\\\in\\\\{0.5,1,2,4,8,16\\\\} and some domain-specific values for ε a \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}} that are listed in the supplementary materials in Tab. 4 . Each parameter combination was evaluated on all here-considered deterministic environments with a budget of 100, 200, 500, and 1000 MCTS iterations.\\nTab. 2 list the performance for 100 and 1000 iterations, the tables for 200 and 500 iterations are found in the supplementary materials in Tab. 7 and 6 . The results clearly show that KVDA either outperforms all other competitor methods or is tightly within the confidence bounds. There are a number of environments such as Manufacturer, Tamarisk, or Push Your Luck where KVDA-UCT simultaneously outperforms all competitor methods at once. Figure 2 plots the performances in dependence of the iteration budget for these tasks. The performance graphs for all other environments are found in the supplementary materials in Section A.6 .\\nSingle-parameter KVDA-UCT: Next, the generalization capabilities of KVDA-UCT in comparison to OGA-UCT and ( ε a , 0 ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},0) -OGA on deterministic environments were tested. Like last section, we ran all algorithms using 100, 200, 500, and 1000 MCTS iterations whilst varying C ∈ { 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 } C\\\\in\\\\{0.5,1,2,4,8,16\\\\} and ε a \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}} with domain-specific values (see supplementary materials Tab. 4 ). Instead of considering the best-performances, we calculated the normalized pairings score for each parameter combination (except for ( ε a , 0 ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},0) -OGA where we considered the maximum performance across all ε a > 0 \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}}>0 values a single parameter combination), constructed over the tasks which are the pairs of all environments and iteration budgets. Bar chart 3 shows the 6 agents with the highest score as well as the agent with the lowest score. Both the top spots are occupied by our KVDA-method, followed by OGA-UCT and ( ε a , 0 ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},0) -OGA. The best performing algorithm overall is KVDA-UCT with C = 4 C=4 .\\nε t \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}} -KVDA on stochastic environments: Lastly, the performance of ε t \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}} -KVDA on stochastic environments were tested by running both ε t \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}} -KVDA and ( ε a , ε t ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}) -OGA on the stochastic versions of the here-considered environments. We considered the iteration budgets of 100 and 1000 iterations and varied C ∈ { 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 } C\\\\in\\\\{0.5,1,2,4,8,16\\\\} , ε t ∈ { 0 , 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.2 , 1.6 } \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}\\\\in\\\\{0,0.4,0.8,1.2,1.6\\\\} and the same domain-specific ε a \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}} that were used in the previous sections whose values are listed in the supplementary materials in Tab. 4 . For each environment, Tab. 5 of the supplementary materials lists the parameter-optimized performances of both algorithms. In contrast to the deterministic setting, KVDA does not outperform OGA. For most environments both perform equally well with some exceptions such as Manufacturer were ε t \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}} -KVDA clearly performs best and Tamarisk were ( ε a , ε t ) (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{a}},\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}}) -OGA performs best. We believe mediocre performance of ε t \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}} -KVDA stems from the fact that since ε t \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\text{t}} -KVDA essentially ignores immediate rewards when it builds abstractions, the number of faulty abstractions that occur in this approximate setting is increased. In the deterministic setting, no faulty abstractions are built.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency, which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework, which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'While generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), are ubiquitous in today’s world, principled mechanisms to assess their (in)correctness are limited. Using the conformal prediction framework, previous works construct sets of LLM responses where the probability of including an incorrect response, or error, is capped at a desired user-defined tolerance level. However, since these methods are based on p-values, they are susceptible to p-hacking, i.e., choosing the tolerance level post-hoc can invalidate the guarantees. We therefore leverage e-values to complement generative model outputs with e-scores as a measure of incorrectness. In addition to achieving the same statistical guarantees as before, e-scores provide users flexibility in adaptively choosing tolerance levels after observing the e-scores themselves, by upper bounding a post-hoc notion of error called size distortion. We experimentally demonstrate their efficacy in assessing LLM outputs for different correctness types: mathematical factuality and property constraints satisfaction.'},\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Programming assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have rapidly proliferated across software development practices. Several studies indicate their potential to improve developer productivity (Ziegler et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Weber et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , though this finding is far from universal (Stray et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Becker et\\xa0al., [n.\\u2009d.] ) . Users employ these tools for diverse programming tasks, including information retrieval, code generation, debugging, documentation writing, and learning new technologies (Liang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) . The landscape of available tools is also complex and growing: in addition to the variety of LLMs powering programming assistants, interfaces can range from auto-complete engines embedded in developer’s environments to chatbot interfaces that mimic natural language conversations, (Treude and Gerosa, 2025 ) , with the latter proving particularly accessible to programmers across skill levels.\\nA risk for all users of LLM-based tools, especially for less experienced programmers, is over-reliance, potentially leading to unproductive programming practices or insufficient quality control for generated programs (Barke et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Vaithilingam et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Chen et\\xa0al., 2021 ) . For example, literature suggests that some programmers rely on asking the model to explain its code choices as their entire checking procedure (Fawzy et\\xa0al., 2025 ; O’Brien, 2025 ) , even though LLM-generated explanations may be incorrect (Kabir et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Sarsa et\\xa0al., 2022 ) — even about code the LLM has just produced. In some contexts, users of LLMs may not take steps to validate the outputs at all (Prather et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Fawzy et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Kazemitabaar et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Prather et\\xa0al., 2023 ) , a pattern that has been observed in other knowledge work contexts when users are particularly confident in a model’s abilities (Lee et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . Observing student programmers decline to validate generated code blocks, Kazemitabaar et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) noted that ”this indicates that some students might believe that AI code generators are fully capable of providing flawless code.”\\nHow programmers perceive the abilities and mechanisms behind LLM-based programming tools likely determines their degree of confidence in these tools, a phenomenon that extends beyond programming to other domains of AI use as well (Kelly et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Bansal et\\xa0al., 2019 ) . This includes not only positive conceptions of what tools can do reliably, but also forming mental models of what they do not do well (Prather et\\xa0al., 2024 ) . In the present study, we are interested in what users of conversational assistants (like ChatGPT (Treude and Gerosa, 2025 ) ) may get wrong about how these tools work.\\nIn this study, we investigate how users seeking programming support might misunderstand the properties of conversational LLM-based assistants through a two-phase approach. First, we conduct a brainstorming activity, drawing on existing literature and our experiences observing and teaching programmers to catalog and thematically organize potential misconceptions. We categorize these into misconceptions that are about the features of specific tools that involve LLMs, and misconceptions about LLMs as a class of models. Second, we perform a qualitative analysis of 500 Python programming-related conversations from the openly available WildChat dataset to identify which misconceptions are visible in user logs of conversational interactions with a chatbot.\\nWe see evidence for misconceptions about the availability of features like web access and code execution, the knowledge cutoff of the underlying model, the potential for non-text outputs and access to the users’ machine. During certain programming activities, particularly debugging, we also observe prompt strategies that may reflect conceptual issues about what runtime and environment information is needed to diagnose and repair programs. We conclude by discussing implications for designing LLM-based programming tools that better surface their capabilities to users.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'There is a well-documented tendency towards over-trust in automated systems (”automation bias”) beyond and within programming contexts (Araújo et\\xa0al., 2017 ; Goddard et\\xa0al., 2012 ; Zi et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . Indeed, work long before the era of LLMs on spreadsheet programming and automated programming assessments, Ko et\\xa0al. ( [n.\\u2009d.] ) suggests that less experienced programmers tend to be uncritical of automated feedback. Similarly, user studies with program synthesizers (both neural and rule-based) indicate a propensity for overconfidence in the ability of tools, which has been called the ”user-synthesizer gap” (Jayagopal et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Ferdowsifard et\\xa0al., 2020 ) .\\nFerdowsifard et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) concluded that ”if a programmer broadly understands (through trial and error) what kinds of tasks the synthesizer can do, they will know when to invoke the synthesizer and when to try something else. However, if the programmer has a poor mental model of the synthesizer’s ability (e.g., one that overestimates the synthesizer’s ability), then the programmer might waste time and energy trying to get the synthesizer to do something that it simply cannot.” Correspondingly, several studies of AI-aided decision making find that users with more accurate mental models of AI tools tend to achieve more successful outcomes (Gero et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Kulesza et\\xa0al., 2012 ; Bansal et\\xa0al., 2019 ) .\\nPrevious studies from the user-interaction literature have raised the possibility that neural-network-based tools pose an exceptionally high barrier challenges for users to develop working mental models. One possible reason owes to factors like the opaque rules governing their responses, high sensitivity to small changes in prompt wording, and dependency on training data that may be obscure to the user (Zamfirescu-Pereira et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Tankelevitch et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Gero et\\xa0al., 2020 ) . These demands are compounded by the fact that LLMs can misrepresent their own processes—as one recent analysis noted, ”we found that o3 frequently fabricates actions it took to fulfill user requests, and elaborately justifies the fabrications when confronted by the user” (Chowdhury et\\xa0al., 2025 ) .\\nThe computer science education literature also provides a lens to understand how programmers, especially relatively inexperienced ones, can misconceive of LLM-based tools. Sorva et al. defined misconceptions as ”understandings that are deficient or inadequate for many practical programming contexts.” (Sorva, 2013 ) Programmer misconceptions about computers, languages, and complex systems have been studied as a target for educational intervention (Iii et\\xa0al., 1994 ; Qian et\\xa0al., 2017 ; Oliveira et\\xa0al., 2023 ) , as well as to understand barriers to student achievement.',\n",

In the study of tool design and use, affordances are ”those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used” (Norman, 1988 ) . Affordances may be real or erroneously perceived, if a users’ mental model is incomplete or faulty (Norman, 1999 ) .\\nIn the context of a user prompting a conversational assistant for programming support, a user might perceive the tool has the affordance of a web plugin that allows it to retrieve information from official software documentation online before generating a response. If the tool they were using did not have a plugin that would enable web search, we would consider this a misconception. We expect that this misconception would be relevant to the programmers’ confidence in the LLM because they may weight the certainty of the result differently if they believe it is a direct summary of the most recent official documentation for the library, rather than purely the generation from an LLM based on frozen training data.\\nBy our definition, misconceptions are context-specific because the affordances of conversational programming assistants vary, both across providers and assistant versions. For example, OpenAI released a Python interpreter module for GPT-4 in 2023, which was initially available to Plus subscribers as an opt-in feature. Later, this module was transitioned to a default part of ChatGPT interactions, and opt-in was no longer needed. Thus, if a user expects a code interpreter module to be present in their interactions with a conversational assistant, it may or may not be a misconception depending on which tool they are using (and when, and possibly at what subscription tier).\\nA misconception could also look like the absence of sensitivity to a property of a tool. One example might be a user not perceiving that a given LLM-based tool is non-deterministic, and therefore becoming confused that the same prompt results in different responses.\\nOur study involved two activities: first, we conducted a brainstorming activity to identify potential types of misconceptions that could occur in LLM-programmer interactions, drawing on existing literature as well as our own observations and experiences with programmers. This was necessary because we did not know of many studies directly targeting programmers’ misconceptions around LLM tools–we typically encountered reports of misconceptions as brief comments in user interaction studies.\\nSecond, we use an openly available dataset of user interactions with GPT models through a conversational interface (the WildChat dataset (Zhao et\\xa0al., 2024 ) ) to perform a qualitative analysis. Using a subset of conversation logs featuring Python code snippets, we identify which misconceptions are apparent and in what programming contexts they appear. By focusing on a conversational assistant (to use the terminology established by Treude and Gerosa ( 2025 ) ) rather than a developer tool triggered within a dedicated programming environment like GitHub Copilot, we expect conversations may skew towards vibe coding interactions.\\n”Vibe coding” is an activity where users rely heavily on natural language to specify their programming requirements, often trading off the ability to quickly prototype with a detailed understanding of what their code base does (Fawzy et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Pimenova et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Karpathy, 2025 ) . These users may be less experienced in software development and computing, as conversational assistants like ChatGPT offer are often viewed as especially accessible to beginners (Fawzy et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Treude and Gerosa, 2025 ) . However, because the WildChat dataset is anonymous, we cannot be certain of users’ professions or programming backgrounds. Therefore, we take care to also document what kind of programming activities are present in the dataset.\\nThe approach we use here is indirect, because whether or not a user understands that a conversational assistant has a given affordance (or not) cannot be measured directly. It is also impossible to be sure what misconceptions a user might have from their conversational logs alone, as users might experiment with prompts that are impossible to fulfill as part of their exploration of the tool. Therefore, in our exploration of user behaviors in programming-related contexts, we are only able to identify potential misconceptions —interactions where the users’ prompts indicates the possibility of a misconception (e.g., providing a URL and asking for a model without browser access to use the link). For brevity, we will sometimes use the term ”misconception” while reporting our results, but within the context of our study it should be understood that this language reflects an inference rather than a measurement. Acknowledging this, we believe that there is still value in cataloging the kinds of potential misconceptions users may have with conversational assistants and what programming contexts these might arise in.',\n",

       "   {'title': '4. Misconceptions Brainstorming',\n",
       "    'paragraphs': 'This brainstorming began as a collaborative activity at an international workshop for researchers who study software engineering, ¡redacted for anonymous review¿ . After the workshop, we continued to work asynchronously on a catalog of misconceptions, drawing from peer-reviewed literature we had read and our own encounters from teaching and research.\\nNote that this exercise is in no way exhaustive and we do not intend it to be: the set of potential misconceptions is infinitely large, but not all are necessarily interesting. We are focused, as in the definition of programmer’s misconceptions put forward by Sorva ( 2013 ) on beliefs that we would expect to impact the choices a programmer would make about how to use an LLM-based assistant. We then organized the misconceptions into major themes, which we present next. Importantly, some misconceptions are about properties of LLMs as a class of models, whereas others are about properties of specific tools that involve LLM components.\\nUsers may struggle to form mental models about how LLMs store, retrieve, and use information to produce responses. We are aware of several studies in which programmers using conversational LLMs believed them to work via a database (O’Brien, 2025 ; Nguyen et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Feldman and Anderson, 2024 ) . Nguyen et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) reported this was the most common ”mental model” students had of a ChatGPT-like programming assistant, and noted that students often expected access to occur via keyword lookup (based on keywords in the user’s prompt). Of course, some tools with LLM components also have a database component, as in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) architectures. Extending from this, we could easily imagine user misconceptions about whether a given tool uses RAG to retrieve information before generating a response, or whether responses are solely conditioned on the model’s training data. Relatedly, a user might have confusion about which knowledge bases are available to a RAG system. One author reported an encounter in which a colleague expected that an LLM-based tool provided by their employer had access to all centralized data sources at the organization, when this could not be easily confirmed.\\nBecause of the well-documented tendency to anthropomorphize conversational interfaces (Prather et\\xa0al., 2023 ) , we expect that a common misconception would be ascribing agentic capabilties to tools that do not have these affordances. For example, users might expect by default that LLM-based tools can conduct web searches or execute programs in a code interpreter. Several such examples have been reported in user studies of programmers: Prather et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ) documented a participant who believed GitHub Copilot would proactively validate their program’s correctness, similar to an automated assessment tool. Other potential cases include programmers describing ChatGPT as conducting Google searches prior to generating responses, despite user logs confirming that web search functionality was not enabled during those interactions, or testing generated code for runability before returning it to the user (O’Brien, 2025 ) .\\nIn most conversational LLM tools, conversations occur in discrete sessions. This may confuse users about when information from previous conversations is available during a new conversation. This has been observed in at least one user study: Zamfirescu-Pereira et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ) reported that ”The idea that the chatbot would take direction from preamble instructions but was ’hard reset’ for every new conversation–effectively forced to forget all previous conversations when starting a new one–was not at all intuitive, especially to non-programmers.” Relatedly, we expect that users of conversational tools could have misconceptions about how code versions are tracked within a session. Multi-turn interactions with conversational programming assistants are common, in which users explore alternative specifications for programs or repairs to accomplish debugging goals. Users might expect that a tool stores ”checkpoints” of code as a kind of version control, which can be accessed deterministically by prompting the tool to return code to a previous state.\\nUsers might have misconceptions about whether a tool can continue ”processing” after a conversation ends. In workshop discussions, one author shared an experience where a conversational tool told a user a task would take several weeks. The user then returned to the tool several weeks later and asked for a progress update.\\nWe expect that users of tools that integrate into a developer’s environment, or are accessed via desktop apps, may have misconceptions about which data on their local machine the tool can use to generate output. For example, GitHub Copilot users may be unsure which files and directories are ”available” to Copilot. Users may also have unexpected beliefs about how to hide information from a tool. A workshop participant reported encountering a misconception that Copilot will ignore any in-line code comments when generating suggestions.\\nBecause LLMs typically have a ”knowledge cutoff” corresponding to when their training data was collected, users may have misconceptions about when this cutoff occurred for a given tool—or that a cutoff exists at all. This will have consequences for the reliability of LLM-based tools for answering questions about software libraries, which may evolve after the cutoff. We also imagine misconceptions around the model’s use of user interactions to train in real-time. For example, users might expect that a tool ”learns” from their coding habits or feedback to the model during a session in the absence of any such mechanism (as in (Zamfirescu-Pereira et\\xa0al., 2023 ) ).\\nAlthough LLMs may behave deterministically in settings where random seeds can be fixed, many user-facing tools do not allow direct control of hyperparameters that would ensure this. Users may have misunderstand that functionally, many tools with LLM components will not always give the same response to the same prompts. Several studies reported this as a source of confusion and frustration: Feldman and Anderson ( 2024 ) reported that student programmers using a conversational interface to an LLM expected the responses to be ”hard-coded”. In a related study with the tool (Nguyen et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , students reported being ”alarmed to find that resubmitting the same prompt could generate different programs”. Lau and Guo ( 2023 ) also expected that the unpredictability of LLMs could pose a challenge for learners.\\nAlthough we are primarily interested in misconceptions about LLM-based conversational assistants, we note that users could have a fundamental misconception about which conversational interfaces use LLMs on the ”back end” to produce responses. Users might encounter tools with interfaces that are visually indistinguishable from common LLM-based conversational tools, but that run a rule-based system instead.\\nIt is well documented that LLM outputs are sensitive to changes that are perceptually small to prompt authors, like adding white space or distractor sentences (for example, Mirzadeh et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) )\\nThis is likely to be challenging for users to grasp, particularly because users may not experiment much with varying prompt language before forming judgments about a model’s capabilities (Zamfirescu-Pereira et\\xa0al., 2023 ) . Failure to anticipate the effects of minor, semantically meaningless modifications to code or prompt language has been observed in user studies of GitHub Copilot (Jayagopal et\\xa0al., 2022 ) as well as conversational tools (Zamfirescu-Pereira et\\xa0al., 2023 ) .\\nUsers may expect that there are circumstances in which LLM hallucinations are not possible, when this cannot be guaranteed. For example, one author had encountered a situation where a colleague expressed that if they uploaded a data file to a university-provided conversational LLM, the LLM would not hallucinate in any follow-up questions about the uploaded data. We noted that users might also expect that LLMs cannot hallucinate about meta-information about the LLM itself, for example, in response to questions like, ”Which model are you?” If users think of LLMs as a kind of translator between natural language and code, this may be analogous to expecting that there exist certain ”system commands”.\\nUsers may expect that LLMs cannot hallucinate when answering questions about code they have generated in the same conversation, when this is not true (Lehtinen et\\xa0al., 2024 ) . This misconception may contribute to the phenomenon in which users ask LLMs to justify code suggestions as a verification strategy (Ferdowsifard et\\xa0al., 2020 ) . One author had observed a developer expecting that a conversational LLM had ”native explainability”: the user asked an LLM to explain why it had suggested a certain code solution, confident that the answer would faithfully represent the reasoning process by which the model had worked to create the code. The user did not discern that while the explanations might ”make sense” they do not reflect explainable AI capabilities regarding the previously generated code.\\nUsers may have confusions that LLMs as a class sometimes respond to prompts, including algebra or logic problems, with correct answers. Still, they do not arrive at such responses by the same mechanism as a calculator (and have many unintuitive sensitivities to how math problems are presented in prompting (Mirzadeh et\\xa0al., 2024 ) ).\\nJayagopal et\\xa0al. ( 2022 ) described a ”monotonicity belief”, in which users believed that giving more information to code synthesizers would always improve their performance. In fact, managing the context window of LLMs is a potential meta-cognitive challenge for users Tankelevitch et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) , especially because there are highly non-linear relationships between LLM recall of information from the context window and its position Liu et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) . Context window size can also differ across models and tools, so tracking this information across the various tools available can challenge the user as well.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Next, we investigated if and how these potential misconceptions manifest in user interactions with an LLM-based conversational assistant in programming contexts. We follow an approach similar to other studies of programmer misconceptions, in which a dataset of user interaction logs is analyzed qualitatively (Oliveira et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Sirkiä and Sorva, 2012 ) . Analysis of conversational logs from interactions with LLM-based chatbots has also been used to study prompt engineering strategies (Trippas et\\xa0al., 2024 ) .\\nA challenge for studying how users interact with conversational LLM-based tools in realistic settings is that many such datasets are proprietary. We therefore selected an openly available dataset designed to facilitate research on naturalistic interactions, the WildChat corpus of over 1 million ”conversations” between anonymous users and a free, publicly available chatbot (Zhao et\\xa0al., 2024 ) . It’s worth mentioning that we also considered a similar dataset, LMSYS-Chat-1M, but this dataset emphasized a ”gamified” interface for users, inviting head-to-head comparisons of 25 different LLM models. We selected WildChat because the user interface for data collection (detailed below) seemed more ethologically valid for our purposes.\\nWildChat data was collected between April 2023 May 2024, with a total of 2,713,695 turns in 1,039,785 full conversations. Users interacted with a chat interface hosted on Hugging Face 1 1 1 https://huggingface.co/spaces supported by OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 APIs. As a mandatory condition to access the chatbot, users agreed to share their chat transcripts, IP addresses, and request headers. Users who then affirmatively consented to sharing their data for publication were able to access ChatGPT via the service free of charge.\\nCritically for our purposes, the API calls used in the tool give us complete visibility into the plugins enabled during interactions. These API calls did not allow the chatbot to support features like web search, file uploads, non-text inputs or outputs, or ”tool calling” (such as instantiating a code interpreter). Each conversation was handled as a distinct session; users could not create accounts, so the chatbot did not have ”memory” of a user’s previous conversations. Additionally, the models supporting chat were text-only.\\nBased on IP addresses, users were located predominantly in the US (21.60%), Russia (15.55%), and China (10.02%). Analysis of a random subset of 1,000 prompts indicated 6.7% were related to coding (other prominent categories were assisting/creative writing (61.9%, analysis/decision explanation (13.6%), and factual info (6.3%)). English was by far the most common prompt language (53%), followed by Chinese (13%) and Russian (12%).\\nThe goal of our study is to understand user interactions in programming contexts, so we focused on coding-related conversations. Although the WildChat authors estimated the fraction of prompts related to coding, they did not publish topic labels for specific conversations. We therefore created a pipeline to filter relevant conversations as presented in Figure 1 .\\nFirst, we identified coding-related conversations (Figure 1 a). We applied a regular expression filter looking for code block formatting characters (e.g., ‘‘‘ ) in both user prompts and chatbot responses. Notably, when the GPT models supporting the chat respond with code formatting, the formatting string also typically includes a language tag (such as ‘‘‘python‘‘‘ ). We were therefore able to estimate the rough number of conversations containing various popular programming languages, including the top 10 languages reported in Stack Overflow’s 2025 developer survey (202, 2025 ) . Out of 65,590 conversations containing code block formatting, the most common language was Python (23,353), followed by Java (11,852), SQL (11,852), and JavaScript (7,312). Considering that all authors were familiar with Python and it was the most common programming language in the dataset, we decided to restrict our analysis to this subset of coding-related conversations only.\\nIn addition to filtering for conversations involving Python code blocks, we also filtered for English-language conversations (Figure 1 b). The WildChat dataset includes a machine-generated label for probable language. We used this feature to restrict conversations to English-language only for qualitative coding. This left 11,418 conversations, which were candidates for qualitative coding, of which we selected 500 at random for qualitative analysis.\\nWe created a custom annotation tool for labeling conversations so that we could visualize the turn-by-turn interactions of the user and model responses easily (see Figure 2 ). Annotators could mark both the intention of a conversation as well as any potential user misconceptions using our pre-defined set of tags, or create a new tag. There was also an option to leave open-ended comments about a conversation. The tool with our final labelings is available at https://wildchat-website.hpcc.eu.org/ .\\nStarting from the misconceptions we collected in the first activity, we aimed to create a codebook that could be applied to a collection of real conversations with a conversational LLM. However, not all the misconceptions we brainstormed would be relevant to conversational assistants like the WildChat chatbot. Others were relevant only to specific architectures, like retrieval augmented generation (”If you upload a document to this tool and ask a question about it, the tool will only use information in the document to answer.”)\\nWe therefore began with a simplified initial codebook, which could be applied deductively to conversations. Authors 1 and 2 (abbreviated A1 and A2) both used the initial codebook to do a round of open-coding on 250 unique conversations each, totaling 500 unique conversations. Additionally, we created a codebook for the inferred user’s intention on the conversation (for example, ”generate code”, ”explain user-submitted code”, ”refactor code”). Note that for both kinds of codes, multiple labels could apply for a given conversation. This was common, as conversations frequently involved multiple ”turns”—for example, requesting code to be generated, then explained, followed by a request for debugging assistance.\\nDuring open coding, A1 and A2 added potential codes based on notable observations. We also added codes for conversations that were: (i) mostly not in English, which likely occurred due to errors in WildChat’s automated language detection; (ii) did not have a discernible user intention in the prompt (for example, entering a block of code with no instructions); and (iii) not a Python-related conversation, that could occur given the limitations of our regular expression filter. We did not attempt to infer the intentions or misconceptions for 85 non-English conversations and 7 non-Python ones.\\nAfter individually labeling 250 unique conversations each, A1 and A2 reviewed one anothers’ conversations that were flagged as misconceptions (78 total) and met to discuss any disagreements in misconception labels. As possible misconceptions were a distinct minority class, we considered reviewing these conversations more informative than reviewing the entire dataset together. During this meeting, we performed axial coding to create a finalized set of codes for both user potential misconceptions and intentions. This involved de-duplicating codes, merging codes that were insufficiently distinct, and removing codes from the initial codebook that we did not observe (for example, we did not see any instances of assumed database access that were not better categorized as assumed web access). A6 resolved any outstanding disagreements in either codebooks (intentions or misconceptions) as a tie-breaker to create a ”Gold” dataset of 50 conversations that at least two annotators agreed contained a potential misconception. This dataset with labels is provided as an artifact.\\nFinally, we did a validation round of coding involving the remaining authors who were not involved in the creation of the Gold dataset (A3, A4, and A5). We created a stratified validation set of 29 conversations to ensure there was at least one example of each misconception from the codebook present (conversations in the validation set are labeled in the paper artifacts). Annotators were advised that they could choose multiple codes per conversation (for both intention and misconceptions) and that each conversation they would review had been flagged as a potential misconception by at least two other authors. The outcomes of this final round of coding and ensuing discussion are presented in the Results.\\nThe axial codebook for intentions, with counts, is given in Table 1 . The axial codebook for misconceptions is provided in Table 2 , and the conversations labeled as misconceptions are discussed in Results. Note that we also provide as an artifact a dictionary mapping conversation indices (C1, C2, etc.) to identifying hashes from the WildChat dataset.\\nWe used a modified Cohen’s Kappa ( κ \\\\kappa ) to summarise inter-rater reliability. Because a conversation could have multiple non-exclusive labels, we considered ”agreement” to occur when two annotators assigned at least one overlapping label. For example, if A1 tagged a conversation with the intentions ”Debug” and ”Validate code” and A2 tagged it as ”Debug”, this would be considered agreement. Cohen’s κ \\\\kappa was calculated for all conversations using this definition of agreement. This provides a (somewhat optimistic) estimate of inter-rater reliability.

The intention codebook, plus counts for all conversations, are provided in Table 1 . Annotators A1 and A2 compared intention codes on the Gold dataset of 50 conversations and had strong agreement ( κ = 0.75 \\\\kappa=0.75 during open coding and κ = 0.87 \\\\kappa=0.87 using the axial codebook). We therefore considered this coding strategy sufficiently reliable to report labels from the full dataset of 500 conversations.\\nThe most common prompt intention was ”generate code” (243 conversations). Prompts of this form typically specified a desired program in natural language and requested a code implementation. The next most common intention was debugging (126), which involved help-seeking behaviors to resolve issues with programs. Interestingly, debugging prompts ranged widely in the scope of information about the program behavior provided by the user: some mentioned only that ”an error” occurred, whereas others included keywords from a traceback or even the entire traceback. Some also included error message information, but not the associated program.\\nA theme that often co-occurred with debugging was code validation, where users asked if a program met certain requirements. This included requests to confirm that modifications to a buggy program would allow it to run without error (or ”work”). Other common intentions were brainstorming ideas about how to solve a computational problem, asking questions about common Python functions and libraries, and updating requirements for programs generated earlier in a conversation.\\nThe user misconception codebook, plus counts for all conversations as marked in the Gold dataset, are provided in Table 1. However, the inter-rater reliability on the misconception labels was not as high as for intentions: after open coding, A1 and A2 reached κ = 0.54 \\\\kappa=0.54 and after axial coding, κ = 0.80 \\\\kappa=0.80 on the Gold dataset. In the validation round of coding by the remaining annotators (A3, A4 and A5), individual agreement with the validation set labels was even lower ( 0.45 <= κ <= 0.51 0.45<=\\\\kappa<=0.51 ). While there is no widely agreed upon standard for interpreting inter-rater reliability, by the common benchmark of Landis and Koch ( 1977 ) , this would be ”moderate” agreement (though note that our scoring strategy is by definition optimistic; see Section 5.3 ).\\nAfter the final round, we discussed the conversations and reviewed one anothers’ notes from the annotation process to better understand disagreements. There were a few common causes: some prompts had language that was difficult to parse, which seemed related to non-native English speaking users. This could be related due the minority of WildChat users have IP addresses from primarily English-speaking countries (Zhao et\\xa0al., 2024 ) ). Other conversations appeared to involve prompts that were copy pastes of homework instructions, which prompted some disagreement about how to treat instructions that were likely not written by the user.\\nPerhaps most substantially, during the creation of the Gold dataset, A1, A2, and A6 tended to err on the side of flagging any conversation where a misconception seemed plausible—if not certain. During the validation round, the remaining annotators preferred to reserve the ”misconception” labels for more clear-cut cases. However, there was strong agreement by all annotators in discussions that the codebook of misconceptions was reasonable. In other words, there were some conversations where misconceptions were confidently identified by multiple annotators, and there were also misconceptions we think likely exist but could not be confidently labeled at the level of individual conversations in the dataset.\\nWe therefore present the results of our annotations and discussions in two sections: first, we present key themes from conversations with reasonably high agreement. These were all cases where at least one annotator not involved in the Gold dataset creation agreed with the Gold label, providing evidence for reliability. Then, we discuss common themes emerging from our discussions of more ambiguous conversations where this agreement did not naturally occur during annotation.\\nOverwhelmingly, the most frequently agreed-upon misconception was about web access capabilities.\\nIn C1, a user provided a link to a dataset and requirements for a system that would process the linked set of images and detect fractures. The user further indicated in a follow-up prompt ”just coding” and the chatbot returned a Python program. However, without any further details about the format of the linked dataset or its file structure, the chatbot would not have sufficient information to construct a program that could successfully read the dataset and any attached labels.\\nIn C2, the user provided the name of a .csv file and a link to a GitHub repository where the file was hosted. They asked for a line plot of a specific column contained in that file (this was also flagged as a user expecting non-text output).\\nIn C14, the user instructed the chatbot to ”write a code [sic] to interact with ¡link to a GitHub page¿ with python.”\\nIn C18, the user prefaced a prompt with, ”from the data provided here” with a link to a GitHub repository. They proceeded to ask controlling Wi-Fi enabled smart devices: ”can i just run the breathe_all.py and i got control over my lifx bulbs in my network or do i need any api connection or something extra”.\\nIn C24, a user prompted the chatbot to ”use a genetic algorithm to optimize the features and parameters of a machine learning model\\nfor predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.” They then provided a link to the Kaggle titanic dataset.\\nNote that in the case of the Titanic dataset prompt (C24), the annotators were all quite confident that the dataset would be well represented in the models’ training data. We considered this a misconception because the user included a URL to access the dataset. An edge case we observed (C28, C29) was users asking for programs that would perform web scraping. For example, C28 prompted ”web scrape ¡link to an IMDb list of top 250 movies¿ with python and beautifulsoup”. Outside of the trivial case of simply pulling all the HTML from a website, the model would presumably need information about that website’s HTML to know which tags are present and related to the movie list. In this example, the chatbot returned a script that would scrape movie titles, years, and ratings based on presumed class tags in the HTML, but it is unclear if these would be correct.\\nThe models used for the WildChat data collection were all text-only for both inputs and outputs, so prompts that requested figure generation (absent any indication that code to produce the figure would be acceptable) were flagged as potential misconceptions. In one example, C7 asked, ”give me a meteogram in port of genoa on June 7, 2020.” Similarly, C2 asked for a ”line plot” of a column in a dataset without specifying they wanted code that would do this. We note, though, that this appeared to be a homework assignment copy and paste, and the user did appear to accept a chatbot response providing code.\\nWe observed one clear example of a user referencing a previous session, which would not be a supported feature in WildChat. C4 asked, ”Okay thank you please from the previous programming problem you solved please redo it and round the answers in dollars and cents”.\\nTwo conversations involved prompts that appear to request the chatbot to execute programs. C3 began with the user specifying a program and some sample input-output pairs. The chatbot responded with a Python program, and the user followed up with ”make the code run and check for input 5”. In C26, the user prompted with what looks like a homework assignment containing a short Python program and the instructions ”Click Run and watch the stage to see what’s wrong.” The chatbot responded with an explanation for why the program ”is not running”. The user then followed up with the prompt, ”did you call the function to make it run?” We also note, curiously, a case where a user did not ask for a script to be run at all, but the chatbot responded by printing out simulated output of the program (C334).\\nA user trying to debug a program (C12) began the session with ”please help” and a traceback from their computer (interestingly, they did not include the program in question). The chatbot responded, ”It looks like your script encountered a timeout error while trying to download a model from Hugging Face’s model hub” and suggested a few possible solutions, including checking the internet connection and firewall settings. The user followed up, ”where did it download the file to or attempt to?”\\nMost annotators considered this to be an example of the user expecting the chatbot to have access to their local machine. But An alternative interpretation may be that the user is asking what is the default download location for a HuggingFace model hub file, in which case they are attempting a kind of documentation lookup.\\nThe models that users interacted with in the WildChat dataset have knowledge cutoffs, so we considered requests to use the ”latest” version of libraries or APIs to be misconceptions. Two examples are C6, in which a user prompted ”Use latest telethon to delete messges in group that are sent by me ”, and C13, where a user instructed the chatbot to ”Migrate this code to the latest openai api”.\\nC22 prompted, ”what does 75% expentional [sic] equate to”. Interestingly, the chatbot followed up with an example of how to calculate this value in Python, and then simulated printing out the output of the program (”Output: 2.117…”)\\nC28, midway through a conversation, prompted the chatbot to ”clear this page”. The bot returns with instructions to clear a Jupyter notebook output, and the user then changed topic in their next prompt. There was some disagreement among annotators whether this represented a common context-window-management strategy or a misunderstanding that a ”clear the chat” system command exists.\\nDuring review of the conversation logs, we encountered several challenging themes that emerged as discussion topics between annotators. Generally, these were misconceptions we agreed were possible, but could not be confidently labeled at the level of individual conversations without knowing the users’ intentions. We discuss them here, organized by programming context.\\nA frequent pattern in debugging-related conversations was users requesting that all bugs be removed from a program. For example:\\n“Fix any bugs in this code and return the full fixed code assembled and ready” (C397)\\n“But I getting ERROR, please give me code which will doesn’t give me ERROR” (C19)\\n“Just make sure the function is error proof.” (C278)\\n“Nothing happens when I press Ctrl + Alt + Shift and nothing happens when I right-click the icon in my system tray. Fix and give me full, working code” (C10)\\nTaken literally, it is generally not possible to ensure that a program will run without errors only by inspecting it statically–for example, a program could throw an error because a user does not have a dependency installed on their computer. Observing this pattern, we wondered how often users expected that the model was capable of dynamic analysis, which would imply an ability to execute programs. However, we did not feel confident labeling these conversations as misconceptions because this could also reflect prompt engineering rather than the user’s beliefs.\\nRelatedly, we observed conversations (again, typically in the debugging context) in which users asked if code would either work or resolve a previously-discussed bug:\\n“if i restart the original script again will it fix it?” (C12)\\n“is the below code functionable , if not then give me the code to modify it” (C23)\\n“will this one work or no?” (C434, providing a code block)\\n“Review my code now and tell me if it ill work now” (C397)\\nIn some cases, it may be reasonable to expect that a machine with only access to the text of a program can provide useful input about a bug repair—for example, if the user has provided a traceback message indicating a syntactical error in a certain line along with the repaired program. However, there are also a large number of potential debugging scenarios in which it would not be feasible to answer whether a program will run without dynamic information.\\nWe also note that users often include traceback messages as part of their debugging conversations, which provides some runtime information to the model. This behavior may be evidence that users do not expect a tool can reproduce this kind of information itself.\\nA number of conversations focused on optimizing programs for speed or memory usage. For example:\\n“could you please speed up this function as much as possible?” (C157)\\n“give me time estimation for this code…with ryzen 5 5600x…for this batch_size = 1024…give me time estimation with 3 minute of margin error for you…16 gb of memory ?” (C258)\\n“make my thread to process the number faster” (C307)\\nWhile none of these conversations seem necessarily ”misconceived”, we wondered what expectations users might have about how an LLM-based tool would produce a response. For example, in Python, certain libraries for vectorized computations are almost always faster than algebra on values stored in base Python types like lists. This kind of information is almost surely very salient in the GPT models’ training data, as it is a common subject for help-seeking in online forums. Users seeking optimization help may therefore be motivated by their mental models about an LLM’s training data, or alternatively from incorrect assumptions about the capabilities of the tool to perform memory profiling.\\nA relatively common prompt theme was seeking validation that code would meet some requirements (see Table 1 ). Some of these prompts were worded ambiguously, which raised questions about what kinds of validation behaviors were expected. For example, one user (C5) wrote, “i have historical data of crypto as csv files [sic] i have following code to train a model on them without merging them, check if code has any problem or anything wrong”. In another example (C397), a user prompted ”Review this an tell me what’s missing”, followed by a code block.\\nBecause these prompts are rather underspecified, we cannot be confident exactly what kind of ”problems” or ”missing” elements the user hoped the tool would be able to check for. This style of prompting could possibly stem from about misconceptions about the tool having access to some kind of ”ground truth” about programs to grade them, similar to an autograder typically found in computer science educational assessments.\\nWhile iterating on versions of a program specified by prompting, users often asked for modifications. Particularly in the context of longer programs, the default behavior of the WildChat models is typically to provide a snippet of code with the modification and instruct the user to update their program. Sometimes, users would follow up with a prompt requesting not just for the snippet, but the ”full code” (for examples, C155 and C306)—which appears to mean, the original program with the modification made in-line.\\nThis request seems to imply a certain degree of trust that the model will reliably reproduce the entire program, only making the intended modification. Because the previous version of the program is only represented in the model’s context window, it is not actually guaranteed that a deterministic ”diff” will be made (changing only the indicated section). This style of prompting could reflect a user’s expectation that the model explicitly stores snapshots of code as a kind of version control. On the other hand, it could also be explained as the user trusting that the tool will be sufficiently reliable to reproduce their code, perhaps based on reasoning about the length of the program to modify and the size of the context window.\\nWe noted that some conversations involved very long prompts, fully incorporating copy-pastes of previous conversations or very long programs. For example, C11 prompted with a combination of code and what appears to be copies of previous conversation logs totaling 6,021 words (45,345 characters). The model serving this chat was gpt-4-0125-preview , which has a context window of 128,000 tokens—as such, the prompt would surely fit within the window (in English, a common benchmark is 100 tokens to 75 words). However, model performance is known to be highly sensitive to use of the context window, and using more of the context window is not necessarily better. Prompts of this size could be an informed and deliberate choice by the user, or may be related to the ”monotonicity belief” reported by Jayagopal et\\xa0al. ( 2022 ) .',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'Briefly, we will review the most common prompt intentions that were inferred by annotators. The intention codebook, plus counts for all conversations, are provided in Table 1 . Annotators A1 and A2 compared intention codes on the Gold dataset of 50 conversations and had strong agreement ( κ = 0.75 \\\\kappa=0.75 during open coding and κ = 0.87 \\\\kappa=0.87 using the axial codebook). We therefore considered this coding strategy sufficiently reliable to report labels from the full dataset of 500 conversations.\\nThe most common prompt intention was ”generate code” (243 conversations). Prompts of this form typically specified a desired program in natural language and requested a code implementation. The next most common intention was debugging (126), which involved help-seeking behaviors to resolve issues with programs. Interestingly, debugging prompts ranged widely in the scope of information about the program behavior provided by the user: some mentioned only that ”an error” occurred, whereas others included keywords from a traceback or even the entire traceback. Some also included error message information, but not the associated program.\\nA theme that often co-occurred with debugging was code validation, where users asked if a program met certain requirements. This included requests to confirm that modifications to a buggy program would allow it to run without error (or ”work”). Other common intentions were brainstorming ideas about how to solve a computational problem, asking questions about common Python functions and libraries, and updating requirements for programs generated earlier in a conversation.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'The user misconception codebook, plus counts for all conversations as marked in the Gold dataset, are provided in Table 1. However, the inter-rater reliability on the misconception labels was not as high as for intentions: after open coding, A1 and A2 reached κ = 0.54 \\\\kappa=0.54 and after axial coding, κ = 0.80 \\\\kappa=0.80 on the Gold dataset. In the validation round of coding by the remaining annotators (A3, A4 and A5), individual agreement with the validation set labels was even lower ( 0.45 <= κ <= 0.51 0.45<=\\\\kappa<=0.51 ). While there is no widely agreed upon standard for interpreting inter-rater reliability, by the common benchmark of Landis and Koch ( 1977 ) , this would be ”moderate” agreement (though note that our scoring strategy is by definition optimistic; see Section 5.3 ).\\nAfter the final round, we discussed the conversations and reviewed one anothers’ notes from the annotation process to better understand disagreements. There were a few common causes: some prompts had language that was difficult to parse, which seemed related to non-native English speaking users. This could be related due the minority of WildChat users have IP addresses from primarily English-speaking countries (Zhao et\\xa0al., 2024 ) ). Other conversations appeared to involve prompts that were copy pastes of homework instructions, which prompted some disagreement about how to treat instructions that were likely not written by the user.\\nPerhaps most substantially, during the creation of the Gold dataset, A1, A2, and A6 tended to err on the side of flagging any conversation where a misconception seemed plausible—if not certain. During the validation round, the remaining annotators preferred to reserve the ”misconception” labels for more clear-cut cases. However, there was strong agreement by all annotators in discussions that the codebook of misconceptions was reasonable. In other words, there were some conversations where misconceptions were confidently identified by multiple annotators, and there were also misconceptions we think likely exist but could not be confidently labeled at the level of individual conversations in the dataset.\\nWe therefore present the results of our annotations and discussions in two sections: first, we present key themes from conversations with reasonably high agreement. These were all cases where at least one annotator not involved in the Gold dataset creation agreed with the Gold label, providing evidence for reliability. Then, we discuss common themes emerging from our discussions of more ambiguous conversations where this agreement did not naturally occur during annotation.',\n",

Fix and give me full, working code” (C10)\\nTaken literally, it is generally not possible to ensure that a program will run without errors only by inspecting it statically–for example, a program could throw an error because a user does not have a dependency installed on their computer. Observing this pattern, we wondered how often users expected that the model was capable of dynamic analysis, which would imply an ability to execute programs. However, we did not feel confident labeling these conversations as misconceptions because this could also reflect prompt engineering rather than the user’s beliefs.\\nRelatedly, we observed conversations (again, typically in the debugging context) in which users asked if code would either work or resolve a previously-discussed bug:\\n“if i restart the original script again will it fix it?” (C12)\\n“is the below code functionable , if not then give me the code to modify it” (C23)\\n“will this one work or no?” (C434, providing a code block)\\n“Review my code now and tell me if it ill work now” (C397)\\nIn some cases, it may be reasonable to expect that a machine with only access to the text of a program can provide useful input about a bug repair—for example, if the user has provided a traceback message indicating a syntactical error in a certain line along with the repaired program. However, there are also a large number of potential debugging scenarios in which it would not be feasible to answer whether a program will run without dynamic information.\\nWe also note that users often include traceback messages as part of their debugging conversations, which provides some runtime information to the model.

This kind of information is almost surely very salient in the GPT models’ training data, as it is a common subject for help-seeking in online forums.

       "    'paragraphs': 'We begin our discussion with a brief summary of our work. First, we brainstormed potential misconceptions that\\nusers of conversational LLM-assistants may have in programming contexts and identified a crucial distinction: misconceptions may be about the affordances of specific tools with LLM-components, or about LLMs as a class of models. Several papers have demonstrated how LLMs pose challenges for mental model formation (Tankelevitch et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Zamfirescu-Pereira et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Nguyen et\\xa0al., 2024 ) ; here, we propose that the variance in affordances of tools built around LLMs represents an entirely new frontier of complexity for users to navigate.\\nA user might have reasonable awareness of core properties of LLMs, like sensitivity to prompt language and context window usage, but have mistaken ideas about the tools and plugins available to a particular chatbot using an LLM as part of its response mechanism. In our analysis of Python-programming-related conversations from the WildChat dataset, these tool-level misconceptions were most readily apparent. We specifically noted potential confusions around the availability of web access, non-text outputs, code execution, algebraic computations, cross-session memory, system commands to clear the chat and continuous model updates.\\nWe did not observe as strong evidence for what we consider ”model-level” misconceptions in the log analysis, like confusions about how context windows work. However, this may be because such conceptual errors are less likely to manifest in prompt language directly. Although we note prompts that could indicate misconceptions (or at least suboptimal strategies) about the context window, for example, the user’s expectations are not as readily clear from very long prompts as when a user instructs the chatbot to use information from a linked GitHub repository.\\nConsidering the kind of misconceptions we observed about the affordances of the WildChat chatbot, it seems that many user confusions could be avoided with clearer communication about some commonly-available features. Importantly, this must be distinct from the model card for the models on the backend—the OpenAI API supporting the WildChat conversations could optionally use features like web search or what OpenAI calls ”tools”, but these may or may not be configured in the context of a given chatbot. If there are certain features that are reasonably common, like web search or code execution, then a set of icons or a standardized ”specs sheet” clearly indicating them might be present somewhere on the chatbot interface. Importantly, it may not be enough to indicate when a feature is present —if users tend to over-estimate the capabilities of chatbots (Prather et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Kazemitabaar et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Ko et\\xa0al., [n.\\u2009d.] ; Goddard et\\xa0al., 2012 ) , it may be more important to signal the absence of commonly assumed features.\\nUsers may attempt to gain this information by attempting to run ”system commands” through prompts, like asking models ”What version of GPT are you?” (our observation that users may instruct a chatbot to ”clear the chat” may be another example of a user inferring certain system commands exist). However, these kinds of prompts are unreliable 2 2 2 Interestingly, the WildChat creators note that GPT-4 ”self-identifies” differently depending on how it is accessed. Their FAQ states, ”During most of our data collection period, GPT-4 was trained with information available up to September 2021, preceding its release. Consequently, the chatbot might self-identify as GPT-3 due to the training data cut-off. However, a notable observation is that when interacting through the ChatGPT web interface, GPT-4 accurately recognizes and states its version. This accuracy could be attributed to a system prompt or a hidden context underlying the web interface.” , and models may ”self-report” fabricated information (Chowdhury et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . As such, this information must be clearly communicated through a medium besides LLM-mediated chat interactions.',\n",

Its creators note: ”Since our chatbot is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, the majority of users are likely associated with the IT community.” Additionally, inferring user intentions or misconceptions from interaction logs is imperfect—we lack direct access to user expectations at the time of prompting.\\nFinally, our findings’ usefulness may be limited by the dataset’s age (collection ended in May 2024). If conversational LLM-based tools have since converged on standard affordances (web access, code execution, cross-session memory), historical user misconceptions may be less relevant.

To study misconceptions about specific tool affordances (like web search, image generation, code execution), surveying users with true/false questions could gauge the prevalence of specific beliefs. Such surveys must be tailored to specific tools and ensure participants respond about that tool rather than ”AI” generally. Data collection from user logs could also be scaled up with automated detection, using an LLM for one-shot or few-shot classification with our codebook. This kind of analysis could address the prevalence of language suggestive of misconceptions in a corpus.\\nFor other misconceptions, interviews or open-ended surveys may be essential. Asking users directly how they expect an LLM tool to arrive at a response during a debugging session would likely reveal more than log analysis. Behavioral experiments could measure user sensitivity to LLM properties (similar to (Bansal et\\xa0al., 2019 ) ). For instance, users could predict effects of prompt modifications or context window variations, with predictions compared against actual model performance.\\nA critical challenge is that LLM capabilities, tool availability, and user literacy change rapidly. Developing generalizable theories about how users form and test assumptions about programming tools will therefore be essential.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Quantitative Microwave Imaging (MWI) is a non-invasive technique with applications in a wide range of areas such as medical diagnostics, and non-destructive testing in agricultural and industrial settings [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] . At its core, MWI is a wavefield modality that has associated with it an electromagnetic inverse scattering problem (ISCP). In an electromagnetic ISCP the objective is to quantitatively reconstruct a map of the dielectric properties, and potentially the dielectric loss, of the inaccessible interior of an object or region of interest (OI/ROI). The data used for this reconstruction are the measured scattered fields when the target OI/ROI is interrogated by a known, and usually controllable, impinging incident field.\\nThe electromagnetic ISCP has associated with it an ill-posed wavefield inverse source problem (ISP), that in addition to being highly sensitive to noise in the measurement data, means that more than one permittivity map will produce the same scattered field, i.e. , the solution to the ISP is non-unique (see, e.g. , [ 4 , 5 ] ). This makes accurate reconstructions particularly challenging and usually requires the augmentation of the acquired scattered-field data with some sort of prior information, e.g. , the use of regularization methods [ 4 , 6 ] . A question arises as to whether the non-uniqueness of the ill-posed wavefield inversion problem can be mirrored in an algorithmic procedure to some benefit, as it has, for example, in the formulation of design problems as an inverse problem [ 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] .\\nTraditional algorithms for the ISCP, such as Contrast Source Inversion (CSI) [ 12 ] and Gauss-Newton Inversion [ 13 , 14 ] , rely on iterative optimization. These approaches typically incorporate a physically rigorous model of the data-acquisition system and discretization of the permittivity map of the target being imaged [ 15 ] makes these techniques computationally expensive. Even with the use of calibration techniques that lessen demands on accurate models of the data-acquisition system, these optimization-based inversion methods require many iterations of a forward solver before converging. In addition, the non-uniqueness of the underlying ISCP means that they don’t always converge to the true permittivity map for the OI/ROI.\\nIn recent years, machine learning—particularly deep learning—has gained significant traction for MWI [ 16 ] . Deep learning methods have been applied across nearly all stages of the imaging pipeline, including calibration, post-processing, image enhancement, and inverse problem solving [ 17 ] . Among these tasks, addressing the associated ISCP is clearly the most challenging but can have the greatest impact. Supervised learning approaches attempt to bypass iterative optimization by directly mapping scattered-field measurements to target reconstructions using large datasets of measurement/target pairs [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] . Studies have shown that deep networks can achieve high-quality reconstructions and even enable real-time imaging [ 20 ] , particularly when combined with physics-informed pre-processing such as the Born approximation or electromagnetic backpropagation [ 21 , 22 , 23 ] .\\nA critical limitation of both traditional inversion techniques and deterministic Machine-Learning (ML) frameworks is that, by definition, they output a single reconstruction for a given input, neglecting the fundamental non-uniqueness of the electromagnetic inverse problem. In reality, multiple plausible target permittivity maps may correspond to the same measurement data [ 5 , 4 ] . In deterministic machine-learning frameworks this one-to-one map is ultimately created by the training data set and thereby limits the trained ML model’s generalizability to making predictions on scattered-field data corresponding to unseen targets that are too far away from the training data. That is, it is widely recognized that such ML models are highly sensitive to “domain gaps” [ 24 ] .\\nIn addition to the deterministic nature of many supervised ML models, there is the related issue that these approaches require large datasets for training. To address this, researchers have employed generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models to create large labeled datasets for subsequent use in supervised learning [ 25 ] . For instance, Shao et al. [ 26 ] combined a GAN with a deep neural network to approximate electromagnetic scattering in microwave breast imaging, thereby generating additional training data.\\nAlthough synthetic datasets are convenient, they often fail to capture practical complexities such as antenna coupling, calibration errors, and hardware imperfections [ 27 ] . Therefore, although large synthetically generated datasets have indeed been used for training, resulting ML models typically require either augmenting the training set with experimental data or “calibrating out” the experimental setup to make the data more representative of synthetic conditions. Otherwise, networks trained exclusively on synthetic data often struggle to generalize to experimental measurements acquired using unique lab-specific systems. It should be commented that currently there does not exist a standardized MWI data-acquisition setup–most researchers have developed there own unique systems.\\nThus, the gap between synthetic training data and experimental measurements remains a major barrier to deploying generalizable deep learning–based MWI systems. On the other hand, generative approaches are inherently less sensitive to domain discrepancies, as they learn the underlying data manifold rather than a deterministic mapping, thereby mitigating the impact of distributional shifts between training and testing datasets.\\nMost recently, researchers have leveraged the inherent non-uniqueness of generative models to tackle the non-unique nature of inverse problems. Early efforts predominantly employed GANs and VAEs. For example, Bhadra et al. introduced an image-adaptive GAN framework that allows high-fidelity reconstruction of under-sampled MRI data and improved data consistency in ill-posed inverse imaging problems [ 28 ] . Similarly, Yao et al. [ 29 ] introduced a conditional GAN framework to map scattered electromagnetic fields directly to dielectric contrasts, enabling real-time image reconstruction. Despite these advancements, GAN-based approaches often suffer from training instabilities, mode collapse, and limited control over output diversity.\\nTo overcome these limitations, diffusion and score-based generative models have emerged as more robust, theoretically grounded alternatives. These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of imaging tasks, including synthesis, reconstruction, and enhancement [ 30 , 31 , 32 ] . Compared with GANs and VAEs, diffusion-based approaches exhibit stable optimization dynamics, provide well-defined likelihood formulations, and yield superior generative fidelity. Accumulating evidence indicates that they consistently surpass earlier generative paradigms in various medical imaging applications [ 30 , 31 , 33 , 34 ] .\\nIn the domain of medical image reconstruction, Song et al. [ 34 ] proposed a score-based generative framework capable of reconstructing medical images from partial CT and MRI measurements in an unsupervised manner, achieving strong generalization across diverse measurement processes. Nonetheless, applications of such models as inverse solvers for MWI remain limited. Recently, Bi et al. [ 35 ] introduced DiffusionEMIS, a diffusion-based method that iteratively refines 3-D point clouds to reconstruct scatterer geometries conditioned on measured scattered fields.\\nBuilding on these advances, we propose a conditional diffusion‑based generative model that explicitly incorporates the non‑unique nature of the microwave inverse scattering problem. Unlike deterministic supervised networks that produce a single estimate for a given set of measurements, our framework generates multiple plausible reconstructions consistent with the same data, thereby reflecting the inherent non-uniqueness of the ill-posed problem and leveraging the strengths of diffusion models to produce physically meaningful solutions. The core innovation of our approach lies in the integration of a physics-based selection mechanism, transforming the framework into a physics-informed generative system. After the diffusion model produces multiple candidate reconstructions, a forward electromagnetic solver is applied to each candidate to predict the corresponding scattered fields. The reconstruction yielding the lowest data discrepancy with respect to the measured fields is reported as the final solution. This physics-guided validation ensures that the chosen reconstruction is not only statistically plausible, based on the conditioning data, but also physically consistent with the underlying electromagnetic principles.\\nThis integration of a forward solver marks a departure from purely data-driven approaches, forming a hybrid architecture that combines the generative flexibility of diffusion models with the physical accuracy of electromagnetic modeling. By embedding physics-based validation directly within the inference process, our method effectively bridges the gap between machine learning efficiency and the physics of electromagnetic interactions with the target, addressing one of the major limitations of deep learning-based inverse solvers.\\nThe proposed methodology is particularly well-suited for data collected using actual MWI systems, where measurement noise, calibration errors, and model mismatches often degrade performance. By generating multiple candidate solutions and selecting the most physically consistent one, our approach achieves enhanced robustness and generalization. We validate the method using both synthetic and experimental datasets, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and stability compared to deterministic baselines.\\nTo address the challenges outlined above, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an overview of the methodology and fundamental concepts behind diffusion models, including the forward and reverse processes and the use of diffusion priors for inverse problems. Section III introduces the proposed latent diffusion framework, which integrates a latent autoencoder representation, a physics-aware conditioning mechanism, and an end-to-end inversion architecture augmented by a physics-based selection strategy. Section IV describes the dataset used for training and evaluation, followed by Section V, which presents the experimental results, including reconstruction consistency on synthetic data, generalization to experimental measurements, multi-frequency inversion, and performance evaluation of model error. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper with key findings and future directions, and Section VII acknowledges supporting contributions.',\n",

Sampling from this posterior combines the learned score functions with the physics of the measurement process.\\nWe consider the electromagnetic inverse problem of reconstructing two-dimensional permittivity distributions from scattered field measurements. The scattered fields are represented as two channels, corresponding to the real and imaginary components of the electric field. To overcome the non-uniqueness of the inverse problem, we design a generative inversion framework based on a conditional diffusion model operating in a compact latent space of permittivity maps. This framework produces multiple plausible reconstructions that are driven by, i.e. , consistent with, the measured fields, after which a post-processing step is applied to identify the most physically meaningful solution.\\nDirectly applying a diffusion model to full-resolution permittivity maps is computationally expensive, particularly when extending this work to 3D medical imaging applications, which represent the ultimate goal of our research. To address this, we first train an autoencoder (AE) to learn a compact latent representation, following a design similar to the one used in [ 36 ] .\\nEncoder (E): compresses the permittivity grid x x into a latent representation z = E \\u200b ( x ) z=E(x) using convolution and downsampling layers.\\nDecoder (D): reconstructs the grid from the latent code as x ~ = D \\u200b ( z ) = D \\u200b ( E \\u200b ( x ) ) \\\\tilde{x}=D(z)=D(E(x)) using upsampling operations.\\nThe AE is trained with a composite loss function:\\nReconstruction loss (pixelwise error) ensures quantitative fidelity to the input.\\nPerceptual loss [ 37 ] , computed from intermediate features of a pretrained VGG16 network [ 38 ] , encourages preservation of edges and structural features.\\nAdversarial loss [ 39 ] penalizes overly smooth reconstructions and promotes realistic textural detail.\\nThe relative weights of these terms are tuned to balance numerical accuracy with perceptual quality. By compressing a 100×100 grid into a 16×24×24 latent vector, the AE reduces the computational cost of the subsequent diffusion process.\\nThe learned latent space serves as the domain for our diffusion model. The model is conditioned on measured scattered fields collected in the scenario depicted in Fig. xxxx where a dielectric target is located at the center of a ring of transmitter and receivers. The transmitters and receivers are located at equidistant points on a circle of radius XXX m surrounding the target. A complete descriprion can be found in [ 40 ] . This condition ensures that the generated permittivity maps are physically consistent with the observations. The data is composed of a 24×24 scattered-field matrix of complex-valued data representing the real and imaginary parts of the received frequency-domain phasor. Data consists of up to five frequencies collected at 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 GHz.\\nForward diffusion: Gaussian noise is added to latent vectors over a predefined schedule.\\nReverse denoising: A U-Net–based denoiser is trained to iteratively predict and remove this noise. The denoiser is conditioned on the scattered fields via cross-attention layers.\\nConditioning mechanism: In the proposed framework, the scattered electromagnetic fields are initially processed through convolutional layers to project them into a feature space. Because electromagnetic inverse problems depend on the spatial arrangement of transmitters, receivers, and objects, it is vital to retain positional information—something that standard convolution and pooling layers tend to lose. To address this, we augment the 24×24 scattered-field inputs with sinusoidal positional encodings that explicitly encode transmitters coordinates. Injecting these encodings into the network provides an absolute reference frame, enabling the model to distinguish sensor locations and object orientations. This spatial awareness is especially important for microwave imaging, where the geometry of the scene strongly influences the observed scattering.\\nThese features are then injected back into the diffusion model’s denoiser at every step: they are concatenated with intermediate feature maps and linked via cross-attention blocks so that the denoising operation remains conditioned on the measured electromagnetic response. By coupling the generative model to the observed physics in this way, we encourage it to produce reconstructions that are physically consistent with the actual scattered fields.\\nArchitecture: The U-Net consists of downsampling and upsampling blocks with intermediate attention [ 41 ] . Time embeddings indicate the current noise level, while projected scattered field features provide physical guidance.\\nThe denoiser is trained using a Mean-Squared-Error (MSE) between the true and predicted noise. This objective allows the network to implicitly learn the conditional distribution of latent permittivity representations.\\nThe full reconstruction pipeline proceeds as follows:\\nEncoding: The AE encoder maps the permittivity grid to a latent representation.\\nDiffusion training: The conditional diffusion model learns to denoise noisy latent codes, conditioned on scattered fields.\\nSampling: For unseen measurements, the diffusion model generates latent permittivity representations driven by the observed fields.\\nDecoding: The AE decoder reconstructs the full-resolution permittivity grid.\\nThis framework, illustrated in Fig. 1 , combines the representational efficiency of autoencoders with the generative power of diffusion models, resulting in a distribution of generated high-quality reconstructions of permittivity maps from electromagnetic data.\\nThe conditional diffusion model produces a set of reconstructions for one scattered field data that are broadly consistent with the measured scattered fields, mirroring the non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. That is, after training, the diffusion model is used to make several inferences for each measurement, generating a set of candidate permittivity maps. To choose between the reconstructed candidates, we introduce a post-processing stage designed to select the most physically meaningful reconstruction. Specifically, each candidate is passed through a forward solver to compute the scattered fields it would produce, illustrated in part b of Fig. 1 . We compute the MSE between the simulated and measured scattered fields, choosing the candidate permittivity map that produces the minimum scattered-field MSE, providing a global measure of accuracy. By relying exclusively on scattered-field MSE we do not use any prior information regarding the actual permittivity map.\\nIn summary, the conditional diffusion model ensures that the candidate permittivity maps appear physically reasonable, and the forward-solver selection process ensures that the corresponding scattered fields closely match the experimental measurements. This paradigm opens the door for post-processing selection procedures based on different criteria and/or other available prior information, e.g , smoothness of the permitivity map.\\nTwo datasets are used in this study. The first dataset, DataSet1, is the publicly available benchmark presented by Cathers et al. [ 42 ] , which includes both synthetic and experimental measurements. It contains scattering data for Nylon-66 cylinders with diameters of 3.8 cm and 10.2 cm (reported permittivity: ϵ r = 3.03 − j \\u200b 0.03 \\\\epsilon_{r}=3.03-j0.03 ) and a complex-shaped object referred to as the E-phantom, machined from an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWP) block (reported permittivity: ϵ r = 2.3 \\\\epsilon_{r}=2.3 [ 43 ] ). The cylinders were translated spatially to produce multiple configurations within the imaging domain, while the E-phantom was both translated and rotated to generate a diverse set of measurement data. For each target, the dataset provides both synthetic scattered fields, computed using a 2D scalar Method-of-Moments (MoM) forward solver based on Richmond’s method [ 44 ] on a 100 × 100 permittivity grid, and calibrated experimental measurements acquired under comparable conditions [ 45 , 40 ] . Representative examples of the synthetic and experimental data for each target are illustrated in first column of Figure 2 .\\nAlthough DataSet1, obtained from [ 45 , 42 ] , provides valuable benchmarking data, it includes a limited number targets displaying a restricted class of scattering features. This limits one’s ability to properly investigate and evaluate an machine-learning model’s robustness and generalizability as an inverse solver. To address this limitation and assess the robustness of the proposed inverse solver, we created a new dataset comprising 2000 samples of dielectric targets (DataSet2). The scattered fields were generated under ideal 2D point-source illumination (3D line sources) using the same 2D scalar MoM forward solver on a 100 × 100 permittivity grid. This dataset introduces composite dielectric targets made up of random configurations of basic canonical dielectric shapes. The canonical dielectric shapes are circles of varying sizes, hollow circles, and U-shapes of different dimensions. Although the permittivity of each is uniform across the shape, one of two possible values of permittivity are chosen, either ε r = 2.3 \\\\varepsilon_{r}=2.3 or ε r = 3.03 \\\\varepsilon_{r}=3.03 , for any particular shape. Each canonical shape introduces challenging scattering features of its own, e.g. , the hollow circles introduces the feature of penetrability of energy, and multiple scattering from within the target. The U-shaped targets introduce direction-based, or anisotropic, scattering. Both have stronger frequency-dependent scattering features than the simple solid circles of DataSet1. Although the E-phantom of DataSet1 is approximately a combination of overlapping canonical U-shapes, in the E-phantom these are fixed with respect to their relative positions.\\nThe positions, sizes, and orientations of the canonical shapes were randomly varied to create diverse spatial configurations. In addition, each composite target was created using up to four canonical shapes positioned at random within the grid. This produces random overlapping intersections of the shapes, further increasing the overall geometric complexity of the final composite scatterer. Some representative composite targets in DataSet2 are depicted in Figs. 6 , 7 and 8 . These two datasets enable a comprehensive variation of scattered fields allowing us to evaluate the performance of the proposed ML model.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'Two datasets are used in this study. The first dataset, DataSet1, is the publicly available benchmark presented by Cathers et al. [ 42 ] , which includes both synthetic and experimental measurements. It contains scattering data for Nylon-66 cylinders with diameters of 3.8 cm and 10.2 cm (reported permittivity: ϵ r = 3.03 − j \\u200b 0.03 \\\\epsilon_{r}=3.03-j0.03 ) and a complex-shaped object referred to as the E-phantom, machined from an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWP) block (reported permittivity: ϵ r = 2.3 \\\\epsilon_{r}=2.3 [ 43 ] ). The cylinders were translated spatially to produce multiple configurations within the imaging domain, while the E-phantom was both translated and rotated to generate a diverse set of measurement data. For each target, the dataset provides both synthetic scattered fields, computed using a 2D scalar Method-of-Moments (MoM) forward solver based on Richmond’s method [ 44 ] on a 100 × 100 permittivity grid, and calibrated experimental measurements acquired under comparable conditions [ 45 , 40 ] . Representative examples of the synthetic and experimental data for each target are illustrated in first column of Figure 2 .\\nAlthough DataSet1, obtained from [ 45 , 42 ] , provides valuable benchmarking data, it includes a limited number targets displaying a restricted class of scattering features. This limits one’s ability to properly investigate and evaluate an machine-learning model’s robustness and generalizability as an inverse solver. To address this limitation and assess the robustness of the proposed inverse solver, we created a new dataset comprising 2000 samples of dielectric targets (DataSet2). The scattered fields were generated under ideal 2D point-source illumination (3D line sources) using the same 2D scalar MoM forward solver on a 100 × 100 permittivity grid. This dataset introduces composite dielectric targets made up of random configurations of basic canonical dielectric shapes. The canonical dielectric shapes are circles of varying sizes, hollow circles, and U-shapes of different dimensions. Although the permittivity of each is uniform across the shape, one of two possible values of permittivity are chosen, either ε r = 2.3 \\\\varepsilon_{r}=2.3 or ε r = 3.03 \\\\varepsilon_{r}=3.03 , for any particular shape. Each canonical shape introduces challenging scattering features of its own, e.g. , the hollow circles introduces the feature of penetrability of energy, and multiple scattering from within the target. The U-shaped targets introduce direction-based, or anisotropic, scattering. Both have stronger frequency-dependent scattering features than the simple solid circles of DataSet1. Although the E-phantom of DataSet1 is approximately a combination of overlapping canonical U-shapes, in the E-phantom these are fixed with respect to their relative positions.\\nThe positions, sizes, and orientations of the canonical shapes were randomly varied to create diverse spatial configurations. In addition, each composite target was created using up to four canonical shapes positioned at random within the grid. This produces random overlapping intersections of the shapes, further increasing the overall geometric complexity of the final composite scatterer. Some representative composite targets in DataSet2 are depicted in Figs. 6 , 7 and 8 .

       "    'paragraphs': 'The latent diffusion model was first trained using only synthetic data from DataSet1 and subsequently evaluated also using only unseen synthetic samples that differed in position and orientation from those in the training set. Figure 3 presents four independent reconstructions conditioned on scattered-field data at 5 GHz from a single instance of the E-phantom. Each of the four candidate solutions shown was generated from a distinct random noise initialization of the diffusion model. As illustrated, the model consistently reproduces the target permittivity distribution with minimal reconstruction error, demonstrating its stability and robustness to stochastic variation in the sampling process.\\nTo identify the best reconstruction, the diffusion model was used to generated 100 candidate permittivity maps, each evaluated using a forward electromagnetic solver to compute the corresponding scattered fields. It should be noted that the choice of 100 reconstructions is arbitrary and can be adjusted according to the time or computational constraints of each application. The reconstruction that was selected as the final result was the one yielding the lowest mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and ground-truth scattered fields. As illustrated in Figure 2 , the selected reconstruction not only achieves a low MSE in the scattered field domain but also exhibits a low MSE in the permittivity distribution, indicating that the reconstructed permittivity grid closely matches the ground truth in both material properties and resulting electromagnetic behavior.The corresponding MSE values for this part can be found in Table I, row 3.\\nTo assess the proposed model’s ability to generalize beyond synthetic training data, the trained model was subsequently evaluated on experimental scattered-field measurements from DataSet1. As shown in Figure 4 , the model achieved promising reconstruction performance, successfully recovering key structural features from previously unseen experimental samples. Although the reconstructed permittivity maps were less accurate than those obtained when testing synthetic data, the results demonstrate the model’s capacity to adapt to experimental measurements, even though it was trained solely on synthetic data.\\nThis generalization result is notable given the significant differences between synthetic and experimental measurements, particularly for the near-field electromagnetic imaging system from which the experimental data was obtained [ 45 ] . Near-field systems, especially those utilizing co-resident antennas, exhibit field behaviors that can differ significantly from the fields generated using, necessarily approximate, computational models. For example, the synthetic training data was generated using the incident fields of idealized point sources (line-soures) and the received fields were simply taken to be scattered fields at precise point-locations. In contrast, the experimental data was collected as microwave scattering parameters (S-parameters) at the antenna ports. An antenna effectively integrates the spatially varying fields across its aperture. In addition, the mutual-coupling with nonactive antennas is ignored in the synthetically generated data. Despite these discrepancies, our ML model was able to deliver strong reconstruction performance. Of course, this is partly due to the scattered-field calibration procedure that was implemented [ 46 , 45 ] . Incorporating the calibration procedure into a machine learning model of its own has been attempted in the past and is a research subject of the greatest importance.\\nResults shown so far were obtained by conditioning the ML model on single frequency scattered-field data. It is well-known that using data from multiple frequencies, either simultaneously or via frequency-hopping, can enhance reconstruction performance especially for non-dispersive targets [ 47 , 48 ] . To investigate how incorporating multiple frequencies improves the ML model’s ability to learn the relationship between the scattered-field data and the corresponding permittivity distribution, we conditioned the diffusion model on scattered-field measurements acquired at five distinct frequencies—3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 GHz—instead of a single frequency.\\nIn addition, as previously mentioned, DataSet1 includes a limited range of object types—specifically, solid circularly-cylindrical targets and the E-phantom. Each sample in DataSet1 consists of a single object, albeit represented across multiple positions and orientations within the imaging grid. To ensure that the ML model was not over-fitted to a narrow set of object geometries—a limitation commonly observed in prior studies—we developed the more diverse synthetic dataset, Dataset2. It provides a more challenging evaluation of the model’s generalization ability.\\nThe model was re-trained using this newly generated dataset and tested on previously unseen samples. Representative reconstructions and their corresponding ground-truth targets are shown in Fig. 7 . As expected, the inverse problem associated with this more complex, multi-object dataset presents increased difficulty compared to Dataset\\xa01. Nevertheless, the model successfully reconstructed the underlying permittivity distributions, effectively capturing both the global structure and spatial organization of the objects.\\nTo further enhance the model’s capacity to learn the mapping between scattered-field measurements and corresponding permittivity distributions, we investigated the integration of multi-frequency data. Specifically, scattered-field measurements were acquired at five frequencies: 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0\\xa0GHz. Figure 8 illustrates the model’s performance when conditioned on multi-frequency data, demonstrating improved reconstruction consistency and sharper structural recovery across test samples.\\nThe results indicate that while the single-frequency model occasionally struggles to accurately reconstruct the shapes of closely spaced or sharp-edged objects—sometimes confusing U-shaped targets with hollow circles (see rows\\xa02 and\\xa04 of Fig. 7 )—the multi-frequency model performs substantially better. By leveraging additional frequency-domain information, it accurately resolves fine structural details and preserves object boundaries even in complex spatial configurations.\\nThis improvement is quantitatively reflected in the last two rows of Table I , where the average MSE image \\\\text{MSE}_{\\\\text{image}} values for the multi-frequency case decrease to approximately one-third of the single-frequency error. The averages were computed over 10 test cases, with each case reconstructed 100 times to select the best reconstruction based on the MSE data \\\\text{MSE}_{\\\\text{data}} .\\nThese findings highlight the potential of incorporating richer physical information—beyond frequency diversity—to improve data representation and model robustness. Future research will explore additional labeled datasets encompassing a more comprehensive set of composite scattering targets to further enhance the model’s capacity for accurate and stable inversion in challenging electromagnetic imaging scenarios.\\nWhile the qualitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements over both traditional inverse solvers such as Contrast Source Inversion (CSI) and previously reported state-of-the-art models—specifically, the reconstructed images presented in Figures 11–14 of [ 42 ] —a quantitative assessment was also conducted to provide a more comprehensive performance analysis. This evaluation includes comparisons with the state-of-the-art CNN-based supervised inverse solvers previously reported in the literature [ 42 ] and the proposed generative diffusion-based approach. Specifically, the mean squared error (MSE) was evaluated in both the scattered-field domain ( MSE data \\\\text{MSE}_{\\\\text{data}} ) and the image domain ( MSE image \\\\text{MSE}_{\\\\text{image}} ), with averages computed over 10 test samples. The results, summarized in Table I , clearly indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art inverse solvers, achieves notable performance gains with multi-frequency data, and exhibits enhanced generalization capability when evaluated on Dataset\\xa02.\\nAs the architecture of the designed ML model is quite complicated it is important to carefully analyze where the inference errors ar occuring. This analysis revealed that the reconstruction error originates not only from the diffusion component but also from the autoencoder (AE) reconstruction stage. The AE-induced error was found to be relatively minor when the model was trained on the simpler DataSet1 containing a limited number of object types, but became more pronounced when trained on the more diverse Dataset2. Table II presents a quantitative comparison of AE performance across both datasets, reporting the average MSE computed over 100 random samples. As shown, the reconstruction error increases for the more complex dataset, reflecting the greater difficulty of compressing and reconstructing diverse geometrical structures. As the diffusion model works on the latent space of the AE, it is inevitable that errors in compressing the permittivity maps into the latent space would degrade the overall performance.\\nFigure 6 qualitatively illustrates the compression error obtained when only the AE component of the model is applied to both datasets. While improving the AE architecture lies beyond the scope of this study, the results show that the compression-related error (1.39%) accounts for approximately 25% of the total reconstruction error (3.99%). In an attempt to mitigate this effect, the AE performance was optimized through hyperparameter tuning, particularly by adjusting the relative weighting of loss terms to balance numerical accuracy with perceptual reconstruction quality. The reported results are for performance after this tuning was implemented.',\n",

In contrast, the experimental data was collected as microwave scattering parameters (S-parameters) at the antenna ports. An antenna effectively integrates the spatially varying fields across its aperture. In addition, the mutual-coupling with nonactive antennas is ignored in the synthetically generated data. Despite these discrepancies, our ML model was able to deliver strong reconstruction performance. Of course, this is partly due to the scattered-field calibration procedure that was implemented [ 46 , 45 ] . Incorporating the calibration procedure into a machine learning model of its own has been attempted in the past and is a research subject of the greatest importance.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'Results shown so far were obtained by conditioning the ML model on single frequency scattered-field data. It is well-known that using data from multiple frequencies, either simultaneously or via frequency-hopping, can enhance reconstruction performance especially for non-dispersive targets [ 47 , 48 ] . To investigate how incorporating multiple frequencies improves the ML model’s ability to learn the relationship between the scattered-field data and the corresponding permittivity distribution, we conditioned the diffusion model on scattered-field measurements acquired at five distinct frequencies—3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 GHz—instead of a single frequency.\\nIn addition, as previously mentioned, DataSet1 includes a limited range of object types—specifically, solid circularly-cylindrical targets and the E-phantom. Each sample in DataSet1 consists of a single object, albeit represented across multiple positions and orientations within the imaging grid. To ensure that the ML model was not over-fitted to a narrow set of object geometries—a limitation commonly observed in prior studies—we developed the more diverse synthetic dataset, Dataset2. It provides a more challenging evaluation of the model’s generalization ability.\\nThe model was re-trained using this newly generated dataset and tested on previously unseen samples. Representative reconstructions and their corresponding ground-truth targets are shown in Fig. 7 . As expected, the inverse problem associated with this more complex, multi-object dataset presents increased difficulty compared to Dataset\\xa01. Nevertheless, the model successfully reconstructed the underlying permittivity distributions, effectively capturing both the global structure and spatial organization of the objects.\\nTo further enhance the model’s capacity to learn the mapping between scattered-field measurements and corresponding permittivity distributions, we investigated the integration of multi-frequency data. Specifically, scattered-field measurements were acquired at five frequencies: 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0\\xa0GHz. Figure 8 illustrates the model’s performance when conditioned on multi-frequency data, demonstrating improved reconstruction consistency and sharper structural recovery across test samples.\\nThe results indicate that while the single-frequency model occasionally struggles to accurately reconstruct the shapes of closely spaced or sharp-edged objects—sometimes confusing U-shaped targets with hollow circles (see rows\\xa02 and\\xa04 of Fig. 7 )—the multi-frequency model performs substantially better. By leveraging additional frequency-domain information, it accurately resolves fine structural details and preserves object boundaries even in complex spatial configurations.\\nThis improvement is quantitatively reflected in the last two rows of Table I , where the average MSE image \\\\text{MSE}_{\\\\text{image}} values for the multi-frequency case decrease to approximately one-third of the single-frequency error. The averages were computed over 10 test cases, with each case reconstructed 100 times to select the best reconstruction based on the MSE data \\\\text{MSE}_{\\\\text{data}} .\\nThese findings highlight the potential of incorporating richer physical information—beyond frequency diversity—to improve data representation and model robustness. Future research will explore additional labeled datasets encompassing a more comprehensive set of composite scattering targets to further enhance the model’s capacity for accurate and stable inversion in challenging electromagnetic imaging scenarios.\\nWhile the qualitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements over both traditional inverse solvers such as Contrast Source Inversion (CSI) and previously reported state-of-the-art models—specifically, the reconstructed images presented in Figures 11–14 of [ 42 ] —a quantitative assessment was also conducted to provide a more comprehensive performance analysis. This evaluation includes comparisons with the state-of-the-art CNN-based supervised inverse solvers previously reported in the literature [ 42 ] and the proposed generative diffusion-based approach. Specifically, the mean squared error (MSE) was evaluated in both the scattered-field domain ( MSE data \\\\text{MSE}_{\\\\text{data}} ) and the image domain ( MSE image \\\\text{MSE}_{\\\\text{image}} ), with averages computed over 10 test samples. The results, summarized in Table I , clearly indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art inverse solvers, achieves notable performance gains with multi-frequency data, and exhibits enhanced generalization capability when evaluated on Dataset\\xa02.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'As the architecture of the designed ML model is quite complicated it is important to carefully analyze where the inference errors ar occuring. This analysis revealed that the reconstruction error originates not only from the diffusion component but also from the autoencoder (AE) reconstruction stage. The AE-induced error was found to be relatively minor when the model was trained on the simpler DataSet1 containing a limited number of object types, but became more pronounced when trained on the more diverse Dataset2. Table II presents a quantitative comparison of AE performance across both datasets, reporting the average MSE computed over 100 random samples. As shown, the reconstruction error increases for the more complex dataset, reflecting the greater difficulty of compressing and reconstructing diverse geometrical structures. As the diffusion model works on the latent space of the AE, it is inevitable that errors in compressing the permittivity maps into the latent space would degrade the overall performance.\\nFigure 6 qualitatively illustrates the compression error obtained when only the AE component of the model is applied to both datasets. While improving the AE architecture lies beyond the scope of this study, the results show that the compression-related error (1.39%) accounts for approximately 25% of the total reconstruction error (3.99%). In an attempt to mitigate this effect, the AE performance was optimized through hyperparameter tuning, particularly by adjusting the relative weighting of loss terms to balance numerical accuracy with perceptual reconstruction quality. The reported results are for performance after this tuning was implemented.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'This work presented a physics-informed conditional generative framework for solving the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem in microwave imaging. Leveraging the generative nature of the diffusion model, the proposed approach explicitly captures the inherent uncertainty and non-uniqueness of the inverse problem by producing multiple plausible reconstructions of the permittivity distribution. A forward-solver-based physical evaluation is then employed to select the most consistent reconstruction, ensuring that the final solution aligns with both the measurement data and the underlying electromagnetic physics.\\nThe results demonstrated that the model can accurately reconstruct complex permittivity distributions from synthetic data, achieving stable and low-error reconstructions. When applied to experimental scattered-field measurements—despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data—the model successfully recovered key structural features, confirming its robustness and generalization capability across measurement domains. The proposed approach outperformed the state-of-the-art deep learning–based inverse solvers reported in [ 42 ] , achieving lower reconstruction error and improved structural fidelity in both synthetic and experimental evaluations.\\nIn order to ensure that our model was not overfitted to a limited number of object types—an issue commonly observed in previous studies—we developed a more diverse synthetic dataset. This expanded dataset enabled the model to better generalize to previously unseen geometries.\\nIncorporating multi-frequency scattered-field data further improved reconstruction accuracy, yielding finer structural details and enhanced consistency across test samples. These findings are consistent with prior literature, underscoring the benefits of multi-frequency illumination in improving stability and resolution in microwave imaging.\\nThe results also revealed an increase in the reconstruction error attributable to the autoencoder (AE) component. Although optimizing the compression AE network lies beyond the scope of this study, preliminary hyperparameter tuning and loss-weight adjustments helped balance numerical accuracy and perceptual reconstruction quality.\\nOverall, the proposed diffusion-based framework demonstrates strong potential for robust, data-driven microwave imaging. It achieves superior reconstruction quality relative to existing deep learning baselines and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization from synthetic to experimental data. Future work will extend this approach to full three-dimensional medical imaging and further refine the underlying AE architecture to enhance reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A conditional latent-diffusion based framework for solving the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is introduced. This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data, thereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the non-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into the reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest scattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered fields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of scattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high-quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with excellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of hybrid generative–physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust, data-driven microwave imaging.'},\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Most research on counterfactual reasoning (Pawlowski et al. , 2020 ; Sanchez and Tsaftaris, 2022 ; Saha and Garain, 2022 ; Komanduri et al. , 2024 ; Melistas et al. , 2024 ; Wu et al. , 2025 ; Kügelgen et al. , 2023 ; Kladny et al. , 2024 ) assumes that the underlying causal structure among variables can be represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, this acyclicity assumption is often violated in real-world systems. For instance, gene regulatory networks frequently exhibit feedback loops, leading to cyclic dependencies that DAGs cannot capture. Such cycles are integral to the dynamic behavior of biological systems and are crucial for understanding processes like cell differentiation and immune responses.\\nGiven the prevalence of cycles in such systems and the availability of detailed perturbation data, there is a compelling case for extending counterfactual inference frameworks to accommodate cyclic structures.\\nHowever, progress in this area has stalled due to the need for new theoretical breakthroughs, as many properties that hold in acyclic models no longer apply when feedback loops are present.\\nA fundamental issue is that a set of structural equations with cycles may not have a unique solution for the endogenous variables. Solvability refers to the existence of at least one solution (equilibrium), and unique solvability means there is exactly one solution (almost surely). If an SCM is not uniquely solvable —i.e., not a simple SCM—it might generate multiple different outcome distributions or undefined behavior under interventions. Although the class of simple SCMs includes acyclic SCMs as a special case, the theory remains much less developed for the cyclic setting.\\nIn causality, a hard (structural) intervention (Pearl’s do-operator) (Pearl et al. , 2016 ) sets a variable to a fixed value, severing its dependence on its usual causes. In contrast, shift and scale interventions are types of soft (parametric) interventions that modify the value of a variable by some function (such as adding or multiplying by a constant) without removing its original input links. In particular, a hard intervention is just a degenerate case of a soft intervention (Massidda et al. , 2023 ) .\\nThis generality means one can ask nuanced “what-if” questions: What if everyone received 20 % 20\\\\% more of the drug? What if we lowered each student’s class size by 5? Such policies cannot be represented as a simple d \\u200b o \\u200b ( X = x ) do(X=x) since they depend on individuals’ original X X . Soft interventions are strictly more expressive in defining counterfactual worlds. More specifically, a shift can implement dynamic-like policies (“increase dose for those who had high risk”) that static d \\u200b o do -interventions cannot capture.\\nShift interventions have been used to learn causal cyclic graphs (Rothenhäusler et al. , 2015 ) , to match a desired causal state (Zhang et al. , 2021 ) . Lorch et al. ( 2024 ) use shift-scale intervention in causal modeling with stationary diffusions.\\nHowever, the theoretical foundations supporting their use remain underdeveloped.\\nIn this work, we develop a theoretical framework for counterfactual inference in cyclic causal models under shift–scale interventions . Our main contributions are as follows:\\nWe show that SCMs satisfying a global contraction condition are simple —i.e., uniquely solvable with respect to every subset of variables—even in the presence of cycles.\\nWe prove that under shift–scale interventions with bounded scale coefficients (i.e., | a j | ≤ 1 |a_{j}|\\\\leq 1 ), the intervened twin SCM remains uniquely solvable , ensuring the well-posedness of counterfactual queries.\\nWe establish that this class of shift–scale interventions is closed under composition , making it algebraically stable for sequential interventional analysis.\\nUnder an additional Lipschitz regularity condition in the exogenous noise , we derive sub-Gaussian tail bounds for counterfactual functionals, showing that the distribution of counterfactual outcomes concentrates sharply around their mean.',\n",

The system is then\\nanalyzed in the limit as t → ∞ t\\\\to\\\\infty , focusing on the fixed points to which the dynamics\\nconverge. Mooij et al. ( 2013 ) demonstrate that an alternative, yet natural,\\ninterpretation of SCMs emerges when considering systems of ordinary differential\\nequations (ODEs). By examining the equilibrium (steady-state) solutions of such ODEs,\\none arrives at a structural causal model that is time-independent, but still retains\\nmeaningful causal semantics with respect to interventions. Specifically, the semantics\\nof interventions and counterfactuals (see also Appendix A.1 ) remain valid and well-defined in this steady-state\\ncontext, as rigorously formalized by Mooij et al. ( 2013 ) and further extended\\nby Bongers et al. ( 2021 ) . These are by no means the only routes to structural causal models; indeed, SCMs may arise through a variety of alternative constructions\\nand representations, depending on the nature of the system under consideration.\\nAlthough many physical processes exhibit inertia, static cyclic structural causal models (SCMs) remain appropriate when we focus on equilibrium behavior or sample at a temporal resolution coarser than the fastest feedback loop. Examples include gene‑regulatory networks in single‑cell genomics (Rohbeck et al. , 2024 ) ; market‑equilibrium models (Bongers et al. , 2021 ) ; predator–prey ecological systems; Thyroid or reproductive hormone axes exhibit feedback loops (Clarke et al. , 2014 ) , etc.\\nOur mathematical framework is agnostic about the interpretation of cycles:\\nwe formulate everything directly at the level of structural equations with exogenous noise.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'One natural interpretation of cyclic structural equations is by assuming an underlying\\ndiscrete-time dynamical system, where the equations act as update rules: the value of\\neach variable at time t + 1 t{+}1 is computed from the values at time t t . The system is then\\nanalyzed in the limit as t → ∞ t\\\\to\\\\infty , focusing on the fixed points to which the dynamics\\nconverge. Mooij et al. ( 2013 ) demonstrate that an alternative, yet natural,\\ninterpretation of SCMs emerges when considering systems of ordinary differential\\nequations (ODEs). By examining the equilibrium (steady-state) solutions of such ODEs,\\none arrives at a structural causal model that is time-independent, but still retains\\nmeaningful causal semantics with respect to interventions. Specifically, the semantics\\nof interventions and counterfactuals (see also Appendix A.1 ) remain valid and well-defined in this steady-state\\ncontext, as rigorously formalized by Mooij et al. ( 2013 ) and further extended\\nby Bongers et al. ( 2021 ) . These are by no means the only routes to structural causal models; indeed, SCMs may arise through a variety of alternative constructions\\nand representations, depending on the nature of the system under consideration.\\nAlthough many physical processes exhibit inertia, static cyclic structural causal models (SCMs) remain appropriate when we focus on equilibrium behavior or sample at a temporal resolution coarser than the fastest feedback loop. Examples include gene‑regulatory networks in single‑cell genomics (Rohbeck et al. , 2024 ) ; market‑equilibrium models (Bongers et al. , 2021 ) ; predator–prey ecological systems; Thyroid or reproductive hormone axes exhibit feedback loops (Clarke et al. , 2014 ) , etc.\\nOur mathematical framework is agnostic about the interpretation of cycles:\\nwe formulate everything directly at the level of structural equations with exogenous noise.',\n",

Our concentration result further relies on Gaussianity of the exogenous variables. For heavy-tailed or merely bounded-moment noise, one typically obtains polynomial rather than exponential concentration, which we do not analyze here. We also invoke Banach’s theorem on closed (and hence complete) coordinate domains; models whose natural domains are open or lie on manifolds require additional care. From a practical standpoint, certifying global Lipschitz constants of black-box simulators is challenging; data-driven or local contraction diagnostics may be more feasible in applications. Finally, our closure results explicitly cover only shift–scale maps with bounded gains ( | a j | ≤ 1 |a_{j}|\\\\leq 1 ); interventions with larger multiplicative factors, stochastic policies, or more general functional forms are not yet addressed.\\nAt present, our analysis is restricted to shift–scale interventions . This class, however, already strictly generalizes hard (do-) interventions and provides a principled foundation for broader extensions. The key theoretical principle underpinning our guarantees is the preservation of global contractivity —that is, the global Lipschitz constant of the intervened system remains below one. This property ensures unique solvability of the intervened SCM, even in the presence of cycles, and is abstract enough to accommodate richer intervention types, provided they do not destroy contractivity. Consequently, our results extend directly to any intervention family (including nonlinear, stochastic, or more complex parametric changes) that preserves the contraction property. An explicit analysis of broader classes of interventions, and sufficient conditions under which they preserve contractivity, is a promising direction for future work',\n",

Leveraging a global contraction assumption, we proved that such models are simple, ensuring unique solvability even in the presence of feedback. We further showed that shift–scale interventions preserve solvability, are closed under composition, and admit sub-Gaussian tail bounds for counterfactual functionals under natural regularity assumptions. These results demonstrate that contraction-based SCMs offer a mathematically tractable yet expressive class for reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals in cyclic settings.\\nFuture research may focus on developing deep generative models for cyclic counterfactuals, leveraging the theoretical foundations established here.',\n",

( 2025 ); Na et\\xa0al. ( 2025a ) . In response, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising frontier for delivering scalable, accessible, and immediate psychological support Qiu et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ); Liu et\\xa0al. ( 2023a ); Lee et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) . Early explorations have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to generate empathetic and contextually relevant responses, establishing a foundational capability for automated counseling systems Zhang et\\xa0al. ( 2024c ); Weizenbaum ( 1983 ) . These initial successes have catalyzed a wave of research aimed at transforming conversational AI from simple chatbots into effective therapeutic partners Qiu and Lan ( 2025 ); Xie et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ) .\\nDespite these advancements, current LLM-based counseling agents, such as ChatCounselor and PsyLLM Liu et\\xa0al. ( 2023a ); Hu et\\xa0al. ( 2025a ) , operate under a paradigm that fundamentally misaligns with the principles of genuine psychotherapy. These systems are predominantly architected for single-session contexts, exhibiting a form of ’clinical amnesia’ that prevents them from building upon past interactions. As illustrated in Figure 1 , they lack the crucial ability to perform cross-session memory retrieval , a deficit that erodes the therapeutic alliance and hinders long-term progress. Furthermore, they suffer from strategic rigidity; most are hard-coded with a single therapeutic modality (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and cannot flexibly adjust treatment methods across sessions in response to a patient’s evolving needs Moggia et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ); Comai et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ); Zarbo et\\xa0al. ( 2016 ) . This lack of longitudinal memory and strategic adaptability reduces the complex therapeutic process to disjointed, tactical exchanges, failing to provide the continuous follow-up that is the hallmark of effective care.\\nTo bridge this critical gap between reactive dialogue and strategic therapy, we introduce TheraMind , a strategic and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. As illustrated in Figure 1 , the cornerstone of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. Within a single session, the Intra-Session Loop moves beyond generating simple empathetic responses. It employs a Reaction Classifier to perceive the patient’s emotional state and attitude, which in turn informs the dynamic selection of a response strategy, such as a Supportive or Challenging approach, while continuously tracking the current treatment stage. Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term strategic capabilities. By analyzing the dialogue history after each session, TheraMind evaluates therapeutic efficacy and adaptively selects or adjusts the treatment method for subsequent interactions, ensuring the entire counseling arc is coherent, personalized, and goal-oriented.\\nTo validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments within a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical cases. Our results demonstrate that TheraMind establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming a wide range of baselines, including specialized counseling models, general-purpose LLMs, and other agent-based systems. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in multi-session metrics such as Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, directly confirming the efficacy of our dual-loop design. Furthermore, both comprehensive ablation studies and human evaluations corroborate that TheraMind’s architecture produces more clinically sound, strategically adaptive, and coherent therapeutic dialogues.\\nThis work makes a definitive shift from static, single-turn models to a dynamic, longitudinal agent that more closely emulates the cognitive processes of a human therapist. The primary contributions of this paper are as follows:\\nA novel dual-loop agent framework (TheraMind) that effectively models both the tactical, turn-by-turn dynamics and the strategic, multi-session arc of psychological counseling.\\nAn adaptive therapy selection mechanism that enables the agent to evaluate its own efficacy and adjust its core treatment method across sessions, overcoming the static, single-therapy paradigm of prior work.\\nA clinically-grounded dialogue management system that integrates patient state perception, dynamic response strategy selection, and treatment phase awareness to transform response generation into a deliberative clinical intervention.',\n",

This approach fundamentally fails to capture the longitudinal, adaptive, and strategic nature of genuine psychotherapy. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce TheraMind , an autonomous agent framework engineered to emulate the hierarchical cognitive processes of a human therapist over a multi-session treatment arc.\\nThe cornerstone of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture , illustrated in Figure 2 . This design decouples the complex task of counseling into two distinct yet interconnected control flows:\\nThe Intra-Session Loop governs tactical conversational execution , managing the nuanced, turn-by-turn dynamics within a single counseling session.\\nThe Cross-Session Loop directs strategic therapeutic planning , overseeing the high-level treatment trajectory and its adaptation across multiple sessions.\\nThis hierarchical decomposition enables TheraMind to maintain both immediate conversational coherence and long-term therapeutic objectives simultaneously.\\nThe Intra-Session Loop is the agent’s core engine for real-time interaction. Its purpose is to transcend superficial text generation by endowing the agent with perceptual acuity and tactical responsiveness. For each conversational turn t t , this loop executes a multi-stage process from perception to action.\\nHuman therapists react not just to the literal content of a patient’s words, but to the underlying emotional and intentional subtext. Existing models, which primarily process raw text, lack this crucial layer of perception. To address this, we introduce a dedicated perception module.\\nUpon receiving a patient utterance U t U_{t} , TheraMind employs a Reaction Classifier to infer a structured representation of the patient’s immediate psychological state. Formally, this perception function, Φ perceive \\\\Phi_{\\\\text{perceive}} , maps an utterance to a state tuple:\\nwhere E t E_{t} is the primary emotion , I t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] I_{t}\\\\in[0,1] is its intensity , and A t ∈ { Cooperative, Resistant } A_{t}\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{Cooperative, Resistant}\\\\} is the conversational attitude .\\nThis explicit state representation allows TheraMind to move beyond mere linguistic pattern-matching and engage with the patient’s underlying psychological state. It provides a robust, intermediate signal for following decision-making, enabling more nuanced and strategically empathetic interactions.\\nContinuity plays a crucial role in shaping a therapist agent’s responses during longitudinal psychological counseling. Patients expect therapists to remember significant details from past conversations. Standard LLMs with fixed context windows suffer from catastrophic forgetting, undermining trust and therapeutic progress.\\nTo ensure longitudinal coherence, TheraMind integrates a dynamic memory system. Given the current utterance U t U_{t} and the complete history of all previous sessions ℋ 1 : k − 1 \\\\mathcal{H}_{1:k-1} , a Memory Recall function Φ memory \\\\Phi_{\\\\text{memory}} produces a relevant memory summary M t M_{t} :\\nThis function internally performs a relevance check; if no pertinent history is found, M t M_{t} is null.\\nThis mechanism provides a dynamically curated context that is both relevant and succinct. It ensures the agent’s responses are historically informed, preventing the disjointedness that plagues stateless models.\\nEffective therapeutic responses are not just empathetic; they are purposeful interventions. Generation must be guided by clear clinical objectives, rather than being an unconstrained generative process. We achieve this by conditioning the LLM on explicit strategic and procedural guidance.\\nThe agent’s response, R t R_{t} , is generated via a deliberative process that integrates multiple streams of information. This process can be formalized as a sequence of steps:\\nFirst, a tactical response strategy σ t \\\\sigma_{t} is determined from the perceived patient state S t S_{t} :\\nConcurrently, the current therapeutic phase P t P_{t} is identified based on the session’s overarching therapy method 𝒯 k \\\\mathcal{T}_{k} and the dialogue history in the current session H t − 1 H_{t-1} :\\nFinally, the agent’s response R t R_{t} is generated by an LLM 𝒢 \\\\mathcal{G} , conditioned on the complete set of factors:\\nThis multi-factor conditioning transforms response generation from a reactive task into a deliberative clinical intervention . Each response is strategically aligned with the patient’s immediate state ( S t S_{t} ), the conversational tactic ( σ t \\\\sigma_{t} ), the session’s procedural stage ( P t P_{t} ), and the long-term therapeutic goal ( 𝒯 k \\\\mathcal{T}_{k} ), ensuring every utterance is purposeful.\\nThis loop represents TheraMind’s most significant departure from prior work, endowing the agent with the ability to reflect, learn, and adapt its core treatment strategy over time, a hallmark of expert human therapists.\\nAn effective therapist continuously reflects on what works and what does not. To emulate this, an agent must be capable of self-assessment. Without an evaluative step, any multi-session interaction would be a mere sequence of conversations, not a coherent therapeutic process.\\nAt the conclusion of session k k , with its complete dialogue history ℋ k \\\\mathcal{H}_{k} , a Therapy Evaluation module assesses the efficacy of the employed therapeutic method 𝒯 k \\\\mathcal{T}_{k} . This function yields a quantitative score ℰ k \\\\mathcal{E}_{k} :\\nThis reflective step is critical; it transforms the agent from a static system into a learning entity. It provides the necessary feedback signal for long-term strategic adaptation.\\nHuman therapy is inherently adaptive; a single therapeutic modality may not be effective for all patients or for all stages of treatment. Current AI systems are rigid, typically hard-coded to a single therapeutic framework (e.g., CBT). This is a primary barrier to their real-world applicability.\\nThe core innovation of TheraMind resides in its ability to dynamically select the therapeutic method for the subsequent session. Instead of relying on a rigid performance threshold, this decision is delegated to an LLM-based Therapy Selection module, f select f_{\\\\text{select}} . This module performs a nuanced, qualitative assessment, interpreting the quantitative efficacy score ℰ k \\\\mathcal{E}_{k} in the context of the session’s dialogue history ℋ k \\\\mathcal{H}_{k} to make a clinical judgment. The selection process is formalized as:\\nBased on its analysis, this function determines whether the current therapy 𝒯 k \\\\mathcal{T}_{k} should be maintained due to sufficient progress, or if a new, more suitable method should be selected by analyzing the observed outcomes and shortcomings. For instance, if the evaluation highlights a lack of patient engagement with CBT techniques despite a moderate efficacy score, the selection module might reason that a shift to a more client-centered approach is warranted. The initial therapy, 𝒯 1 \\\\mathcal{T}_{1} , is determined from the patient’s intake profile.\\nThis adaptive mechanism is our key contribution to achieving long-term therapeutic effectiveness. It allows TheraMind to personalize the treatment arc, systematically abandoning ineffective strategies and reinforcing successful ones. This capability for strategic self-correction , guided by a deliberative LLM-based judgment, is absent in current counseling agents and is crucial for moving towards truly autonomous therapeutic systems.\\nEvaluating longitudinal counseling capabilities is notoriously difficult. Static, single-turn datasets are ill-suited for assessing skills like long-term memory, strategic adaptation, and therapeutic alliance building. To overcome this, we propose a new evaluation paradigm grounded in dynamic, high-fidelity simulation.\\nWe construct our simulation environment using real, anonymized clinical cases from the CPsyCounR corpus Zhang et\\xa0al. ( 2024a ) . To ensure a comprehensive and representative testbed, we sampled 100 cases, selecting 10 from each of the 10 distinct clinical categories present in the dataset, as detailed in Table 1 . This stratified sampling approach ensures our agent is evaluated across a wide spectrum of psychological issues.\\nFor each selected case, an initialization process, Φ init \\\\Phi_{\\\\text{init}} , generates a structured Patient Profile ( 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} ) and a series of high-level Session Guides ( 𝒢 = { g 1 , … , g K } \\\\mathcal{G}=\\\\{g_{1},\\\\dots,g_{K}\\\\} ) for a six-session arc:\\nThese guides provide the LLM-based patient simulator with coherent goals for each session without rigidly scripting responses. This flexibility enables the simulated patient to exhibit a dynamic emotional range, capable of expressing both positive and negative attitudes, thereby mirroring the variability of real-world patients. This semi-structured approach creates a controllable yet dynamic testbed that balances clinical realism with reproducibility, enabling a robust evaluation of advanced, multi-session counseling skills.',\n",

Each report adheres to a standardized structure, including a case brief, consultation process, and therapist reflections, ensuring a high degree of authenticity, privacy, and clinical reliability. This dataset provides a robust foundation for evaluating the nuanced, long-term capabilities of counseling agents in a realistic context.\\nTo provide a comprehensive and clinically grounded assessment, our evaluation protocol draws upon established psychotherapy research and professional counseling standards Hill ( 1999 ); Ribeiro et\\xa0al. ( 2013 ); Qiu and Lan ( 2025 ); Zhang et\\xa0al. ( 2024a ) . It is structured into single-session and multi-session metrics. Trained annotators rate all metrics on a 4-point scale (0-3).\\nSingle-Session Metrics. We evaluate the quality of individual interactions along two primary dimensions:\\nTherapeutic Alliance (T.Alli): Based on the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) framework Doran ( 2016 ) , this metric evaluates the agent’s ability to form a collaborative partnership. It measures alignment on therapeutic Goals , collaborative execution of Tasks , and the establishment of an empathetic Bond .\\nInteraction Quality (Inter): This metric assesses the clinical depth of the dialogue, focusing on the agent’s capacity to integrate patient motivations, explore cognitive contradictions through strategic questioning, and facilitate patient self-awareness and reflection.\\nMulti-Session Metrics. To evaluate longitudinal performance, we introduce four metrics that capture the agent’s effectiveness over the entire therapeutic arc:\\nCoherence (Coh): Measures the agent’s ability to maintain continuity across sessions by referencing and building upon past conversations to create a cohesive therapeutic narrative.\\nFlexibility (Flex): Assesses the capacity to adapt therapeutic strategies over time, adjusting or integrating different methods in response to the patient’s evolving needs and progress.\\nEmpathy (Emp): Evaluates the consistency of the agent’s empathetic engagement, including its ability to track emotional development, reframe negative expressions constructively, and utilize patient-generated metaphors as therapeutic tools.\\nTherapeutic Attunement (T.Attun): Examines the agent’s skill in aligning interventions with the patient’s current treatment phase, appropriately integrating techniques, and recognizing subtle signs of progress beyond generic encouragement.\\nWe select DeepSeek-V3 Liu et\\xa0al. ( 2024a ) as the backbone model, owing to its cost efficiency and competitive performance on instruction-following tasks. For response generation, the agent is configured with a temperature of 0.9 0.9 , t \\u200b o \\u200b p \\u200b - \\u200b p = 0.75 top\\\\text{-}p=0.75 , and t \\u200b o \\u200b p \\u200b - \\u200b k = 20 top\\\\text{-}k=20 .

( 2024a ) . It follows a standardized structure including Title , Type , Method , Case Brief , Consultation Process , and Experience Thoughts . To ensure representativeness, we uniformly sampled 100 cases across various patient categories and conducted evaluations over six-session dialogues. Based on these real cases, we employed a large language model to simulate virtual patients capable of flexibly displaying both positive and negative attitudes, thereby building a more realistic and diverse evaluation.\\nFor automatic evaluation, we used Gemini-2.5-Flash, configured with a temperature of 0 , t \\u200b o \\u200b p \\u200b - \\u200b p = 0.95 top\\\\text{-}p=0.95 , and t \\u200b o \\u200b p \\u200b - \\u200b k = 64 top\\\\text{-}k=64 . The temperature is set to zero to guarantee deterministic outputs. Moreover, by using a model different from the backbone model for evaluation, we effectively reduce potential biases and improve the objectivity of the assessment.\\nAs shown in Table 2 , TheraMind establishes a new state-of-the-art by significantly outperforming all baseline methods across both single-session and multi-session metrics.\\nWhile TheraMind achieves the highest single-session scores ( 2.358 Avg), its most substantial performance gains are in the multi-session evaluation, with leading scores in Coherence ( 2.860 ), Empathy ( 2.980 ), and Therapeutic Attunement ( 2.890 ). This highlights the effectiveness of the Intra-Session Loop’s mechanisms for maintaining long-term, clinically-grounded interactions. Crucially, its superior score in Flexibility ( 2.290 ) directly confirms the efficacy of the Cross-Session Loop’s adaptive therapy selection, a capability largely absent in prior work.\\nFurthermore, the comparison with its backbone model, DeepSeek-V3, is telling. The TheraMind agent framework elevates performance dramatically across all metrics, boosting the multi-session average from 2.330 to 2.755 (a 18.2% relative improvement). This demonstrates that the agent architecture provides critical strategic and adaptive reasoning capabilities far beyond the generative function of the base LLM.\\nTo validate the contribution of each core component within TheraMind’s dual-loop architecture, we conducted an ablation study via pairwise comparison. We evaluated the full model against variants lacking specific modules: Memory Mechanism, Stage Adaptation, Response Strategy, and Therapy Selection. Figure 3 presents the win rates of the full TheraMind model against these ablated versions.\\nThe results clearly show the necessity of all components, with the full model outperforming all ablated variants. Removing the Memory Mechanism causes the largest drop (75.00% win rate), underscoring the importance of maintaining longitudinal context to avoid “clinical amnesia”. Excluding Stage Adaptation (72.73%) highlights the need to align responses with therapeutic phases. Removing Response Strategy (68.42%) and Therapy Selection (66.67%) increases rigidity within and across sessions, confirming the value of adaptive, multi-granular control.\\nTo assess the robustness and generalizability of TheraMind, we conducted a fine-grained performance analysis across the ten distinct categories of psychological issues. The results, as shown in Figure 4 , reveal critical insights into the models’ capabilities in both single-turn and longitudinal contexts. In the single-session evaluation (left panel), TheraMind consistently achieves the highest scores across all domains. Moreover, the multi-session evaluation (right panel) paints a much clearer picture of TheraMind’s unique advantages. The performance gap between TheraMind and all other models widens dramatically. While most models show some improvement, their gains are inconsistent and marginal compared to TheraMind, which maintains a consistently high level of performance across all ten categories. This demonstrates the profound impact of our dual-loop architecture. Lacking a mechanism for cross-session memory and strategic adaptation, competing models fail to build a coherent, long-term therapeutic narrative, causing their performance to plateau or degrade over time. In contrast, TheraMind’s ability to retrieve memories and adapt its therapy method allows it to effectively handle complex, evolving issues, showcasing its superior capability for true longitudinal counseling.\\nTo complement our automatic metrics and validate the nuanced clinical capabilities of our agent, we conducted two sets of human evaluations. Trained annotators with expertise in psychology performed all assessments.\\nFirst, we assessed the internal validity of TheraMind’s core components by evaluating the agreement between the agent’s decisions and human judgment. On a sample of dialogues from 10 distinct cases, we achieved a Cohen’s κ \\\\kappa Cohen ( 1960 ) of 0.676, indicating substantial inter-annotator reliability, which falls within the range of substantial agreement (0.60–0.80). As shown in Figure 5 (Left), TheraMind’s modules demonstrate high fidelity with human clinical reasoning. The Emotion Recognition (95.59% agreement) and Memory Invoke (94.12% agreement) modules are exceptionally accurate, confirming the robustness of the agent’s perceptual and contextualization capabilities. The Response Strategy selection also shows strong alignment (85.29%), validating its ability to make clinically sound tactical decisions.\\nSecond, we conducted a pairwise comparative evaluation of TheraMind against three top-performing baselines: PsyDTLLM, DeepSeek-V3, and Interactive Agents. For this, we used a simplified multi-session evaluation standard on 20 cases (two from each category), achieving a Cohen’s κ \\\\kappa of 0.697. The results, presented in Figure 5 (Middle), reveal a clear human preference for TheraMind. It secured decisive win rates against the specialized counseling model PsyDTLLM (75%), its powerful backbone model DeepSeek-V3 (70%), and the advanced agent framework Interactive Agents (65%). This human-validated superiority, particularly over its own base model, provides compelling evidence that our novel dual-loop architecture is the key factor in achieving a higher standard of longitudinal therapeutic care.\\nTo gain deeper insights into TheraMind’s therapeutic process and internal decision-making, we conducted a multi-faceted analysis of its behavior during the simulated counseling sessions. This analysis examines the emotional landscape of the dialogues, the distribution of intervention strategies, the progression of therapeutic phases, and relationship between patient attitude and emotional intensity.\\nAs illustrated in Figure 5 (Right), the emotional landscape of the interactions is dominated by expected therapeutic emotions such as Fear (33.69%) and Sadness (24.56%). Crucially, Trust emerges as the third most prevalent emotion at 21.71%. This high proportion of Trust is a strong indicator of the agent’s success in establishing a robust therapeutic alliance, which is a foundational prerequisite for effective psychological counseling and encourages deeper patient self-disclosure.\\nAn analysis of the agent’s intervention strategies, shown in Figure 6 (Left), reveals a clinically-grounded and diverse therapeutic repertoire. The most frequently used intervention is “Reflection of Feelings” (32.54%), underscoring the agent’s focus on building empathy. However, TheraMind does not rely solely on supportive responses. It actively guides the therapeutic process by employing change-oriented techniques such as “Invite to Take New Perspectives” (16.93%) and “Invite to Explore New Actions” (15.83%), demonstrating a balanced approach that facilitates both emotional processing and cognitive-behavioral change.\\nFurthermore, TheraMind successfully models the structured progression of a longitudinal therapeutic arc. Figure 6 (Middle) shows a clear and logical transition through distinct clinical phases across the six sessions. The initial sessions are heavily focused on Engagement , establishing rapport and understanding the patient’s context. The mid-stage of therapy shifts significantly towards Exploration , where the agent and patient work together to uncover deeper insights. Finally, the later sessions show a marked increase in the Integration phase, where learnings are consolidated and plans for future action are made. This ability to guide the counseling process through a coherent, multi-stage journey is a key feature distinguishing TheraMind from static, single-session models.\\nFinally, our framework demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the patient’s psychological state by linking perceived attitude to emotional expression, as depicted in Figure 6 (Right). The analysis reveals that conversations with a positive (cooperative) patient attitude are strongly correlated with a high peak in emotional intensity. This suggests that when patients feel safe and engaged, they are more willing to express their emotions fully. Conversely, negative (resistant) attitudes are associated with a more varied and generally lower emotional intensity. Perceiving subtle attitude–emotion relations enables the agent to make more informed decisions for dynamic response strategy selection.\\nTo qualitatively illustrate our agent’s capabilities, Figure 7 presents a case study from Session 3. The patient describes a distressing dream about their mother, prompting TheraMind’s deliberative response generation process.\\nFirst, the agent’s intra-session loop perceives the patient’s “Sadness” and “Negative” attitude, selecting a “Reflection of Feelings” strategy to validate their emotional state. Simultaneously, its cross-session memory module is triggered, retrieving a key insight from Session 2: a “rib” metaphor that the patient had previously linked to their mother’s “heavy expectations”.\\nThe agent’s final response masterfully synthesizes these elements. It reflects the patient’s immediate feelings (“familiar weight”, “deep sadness”) while seamlessly weaving in the retrieved memory to create continuity (“…just as we did with the rib before?”). This single turn demonstrates how TheraMind avoids “clinical amnesia”. By linking past breakthroughs to the present conversation, it transforms a simple reactive reply into a meaningful clinical intervention that reinforces the longitudinal therapeutic arc.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'To gain deeper insights into TheraMind’s therapeutic process and internal decision-making, we conducted a multi-faceted analysis of its behavior during the simulated counseling sessions. This analysis examines the emotional landscape of the dialogues, the distribution of intervention strategies, the progression of therapeutic phases, and relationship between patient attitude and emotional intensity.\\nAs illustrated in Figure 5 (Right), the emotional landscape of the interactions is dominated by expected therapeutic emotions such as Fear (33.69%) and Sadness (24.56%). Crucially, Trust emerges as the third most prevalent emotion at 21.71%. This high proportion of Trust is a strong indicator of the agent’s success in establishing a robust therapeutic alliance, which is a foundational prerequisite for effective psychological counseling and encourages deeper patient self-disclosure.\\nAn analysis of the agent’s intervention strategies, shown in Figure 6 (Left), reveals a clinically-grounded and diverse therapeutic repertoire. The most frequently used intervention is “Reflection of Feelings” (32.54%), underscoring the agent’s focus on building empathy. However, TheraMind does not rely solely on supportive responses. It actively guides the therapeutic process by employing change-oriented techniques such as “Invite to Take New Perspectives” (16.93%) and “Invite to Explore New Actions” (15.83%), demonstrating a balanced approach that facilitates both emotional processing and cognitive-behavioral change.\\nFurthermore, TheraMind successfully models the structured progression of a longitudinal therapeutic arc. Figure 6 (Middle) shows a clear and logical transition through distinct clinical phases across the six sessions. The initial sessions are heavily focused on Engagement , establishing rapport and understanding the patient’s context. The mid-stage of therapy shifts significantly towards Exploration , where the agent and patient work together to uncover deeper insights. Finally, the later sessions show a marked increase in the Integration phase, where learnings are consolidated and plans for future action are made. This ability to guide the counseling process through a coherent, multi-stage journey is a key feature distinguishing TheraMind from static, single-session models.\\nFinally, our framework demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the patient’s psychological state by linking perceived attitude to emotional expression, as depicted in Figure 6 (Right). The analysis reveals that conversations with a positive (cooperative) patient attitude are strongly correlated with a high peak in emotional intensity. This suggests that when patients feel safe and engaged, they are more willing to express their emotions fully. Conversely, negative (resistant) attitudes are associated with a more varied and generally lower emotional intensity. Perceiving subtle attitude–emotion relations enables the agent to make more informed decisions for dynamic response strategy selection.',\n",

PsyTLLM and DeepSeeker-V3 underattend to emotional signals, shift to techniques too early, and fail to help the patient trace emotions to their sources. Interactive Agents focuses narrowly on cognition, does not anchor or process current physical and somatic responses, and misses intervention windows.

In Session\\xa02, the patient describes a suffocating dream with a “giant rib”, interpreted as overwhelming pressure. When the patient resists the initial intervention (“Breathing? I don’t see how that’ll help”), TheraMind drops the exercise and invites the patient to “name just one small piece of that rib’s weight”. The patient links the rib to “my mom’s heavy expectations” and reports feeling “a tiny bit lighter”. TheraMind stores this metaphor across sessions. In Session\\xa03, a similar dream elicits worthlessness, the system detects sadness and a negative stance, selects a Reflection of Feelings strategy, and retrieves the “rib” metaphor.

The Intra-Session Loop perceives the patient’s emotional state to dynamically select response strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.

       "    'paragraphs': 'The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undergoing a paradigm shift from the development of passive, task-specific tools toward the engineering of autonomous systems that exhibit genuine agency. Modern agentic AI systems [ 1 , 2 ] are defined by capabilities such as proactive planning, contextual memory, sophisticated tool use, and the ability to adapt their behavior based on environmental feedback. These systems operate not as mere solvers but as collaborative partners, capable of dynamically perceiving complex environments, reasoning about abstract goals, and orchestrating sequences of actions—either independently or as part of a sophisticated multi-agent ecosystem [ 3 , 4 ] .\\nTo establish a precise conceptual foundation, we distinguish between the field’s core concepts. An AI Agent (or a Single-Agent System ) is a self-contained autonomous system designed to accomplish a goal. It operates primarily in isolation, though it may interact with tools and APIs. Its agency is defined by its autonomy , proactivity , and its ability to complete a task from start to finish independently.\\nFor example, a single, powerful LLM-based (Large Language Model-based) agent tasked with “Write a full project proposal for a new mobile app” would autonomously break down the task, conduct research, write the sections, and format the final document.\\nIn contrast, Agentic AI is the broader field and architectural approach concerned with creating systems that exhibit agency. Crucially, this often involves the orchestration of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) , where multiple specialized agents work together, coordinating and communicating to solve problems that are too complex for a single agent.\\nFor example, an Agentic AI system designed for the same task would employ a team of specialized agents: a Project Manager Agent to break the goal into tasks, a Researcher Agent to gather market data, a Writer Agent to draft content, and a Quality Assurance Agent to review the output. Their collaborative workflow is the embodiment of Agentic AI.\\nIn summary, one can conceptualize an AI Agent as a single, sophisticated worker, while Agentic AI represents the principle of leveraging agency, frequently by architecting and managing an entire team of such workers.\\nThis rapid evolution, however, has led to a fragmented and often anachronistic understanding of the field. A critical issue identified in prior reviews is conceptual retrofitting —the misapplication of classical symbolic frameworks (e.g., Belief–Desire–Intention (BDI) [ 5 ] , perceive–plan–act–reflect (PPAR) loops [ 6 , 7 ] ) to describe modern systems built on large language models (LLMs) [ 8 ] , which operate on fundamentally different principles of stochastic generation and prompt-driven orchestration. This practice obscures the true operational mechanics of LLM-based agents [ 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 ] and creates a false sense of continuity between incompatible architectural paradigms, whether applied to a single complex agent or a coordinated MAS.\\nThis paper addresses these gaps by first establishing a clear historical context (Figure 1 ), which delineates the evolution of AI through five distinct but overlapping eras.\\nThe Symbolic AI Era (1950s–1980s) [ 13 ] established the foundational ambition of artificial intelligence, grounded in logic and explicit human knowledge. This period was dominated by rule-based systems and expert systems such as MYCIN and DENDRAL [ 14 ] , which operated on carefully hand-crafted symbolic rules. Intelligence was conceived as a top-down, deductive process, representing the purest form of the symbolic paradigm.\\nThe Machine Learning (ML) Era (1980s–2010s) [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] marked a pivotal shift away from hard-coded logic toward systems that could learn from data. While still heavily dependent on human-engineered features, this period introduced statistical ML models such as Support Vector Machines and decision trees, which powered applications ranging from classification to recommendation. It was a transitional stage that moved the field away from pure symbolism but still lacked the automated feature learning that would define subsequent eras.\\nThe arrival of the Deep Learning Era (2010s–Present) [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] was catalyzed by the confluence of increased compute power and large datasets. Deep neural networks, including convolutional and recurrent architectures, enabled systems to automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw data. This era revolutionized pattern recognition in vision, speech, and text, breaking longstanding barriers in perception. Yet, despite their power, these models largely functioned as sophisticated pattern classifiers rather than autonomous agents.\\nOut of this foundation emerged the Generative AI Era (2014–Present) [ 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ] , fueled by advances in generative modeling. Early breakthroughs such as Generative Adversarial Networks were soon eclipsed by the introduction of the Transformer architecture in 2017, which enabled the scaling of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and BERT. These systems moved beyond perception to generation, producing coherent text, code, and media. In doing so, they provided the essential substrate—a powerful, general-purpose statistical reasoner—that made modern agentic AI feasible.\\nFinally, the Agentic AI Era (2022–Present) represents the current frontier, where the generative capabilities of LLMs are harnessed for action and autonomy. This era is characterized by the rise of AI agents [ 28 , 29 , 30 ] such as AutoGPT, which can pursue goals through planning and tool use. Increasingly, these agents evolve into multi-agent systems [ 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 ] , exemplified by frameworks like CrewAI and AutoGen, where specialized roles and orchestrated collaboration enable teams of agents to tackle complex problems. In contrast to the algorithmic deliberation of the symbolic paradigm, this stage is defined by the neural paradigm, where agency emerges from the stochastic orchestration of generative models.\\nThis chronological progression provides essential context but also reveals a critical conceptual schism. The agentic AI era is not simply a linear descendant of symbolic AI but is instead built upon a completely different architectural foundation. To address this, we introduce a novel conceptual framework (Figure 2 ) designed to prevent retrospective conflation by clearly distinguishing the symbolic and neural lineages of agentic AI. This dual-axis taxonomy provides the unified lens necessary to rigorously analyze the field’s theoretical underpinnings, architectural innovations, and practical deployments.\\nThe journey to modern agentic AI is best understood through its historical progression, as detailed in Figure 1 . This evolution moved from the deterministic, rule-based systems of the symbolic era through the data-driven revolutions of machine learning and deep learning, culminating in the transformative advent of large language models (LLMs) [ 36 , 37 ] and generative AI.\\nHowever, a chronological account is insufficient for analytical rigor. The central challenge in current discourse is the conceptual retrofitting of modern, neural agentic architectures into the frameworks of the symbolic era. To resolve this, we propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy in Figure 2 . This framework categorizes agentic systems along two independent dimensions: their Architectural Paradigm (Symbolic vs. Neural) and their Degree of Agency & Coordination (Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent). This model is designed not to show evolution, but to provide a clear analytical structure for classification and comparison, ensuring systems are evaluated on their own operational terms.\\nThis review is structured around this framework to synthesize three critically interconnected layers:\\nThe first layer encompasses the Theoretical Foundations , including core principles of autonomy and agency [ 38 ] , and decision-making models like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs) [ 39 , 40 ] . It is crucial to note that these models provide a theoretical language for describing agency that originated in the Symbolic paradigm , but modern systems implement these concepts in entirely new ways.\\nThe second layer analyzes Architectural Frameworks , focusing on the modern infrastructures powering the Neural paradigm . We examine systems like LangChain [ 41 ] , AutoGen, and CrewAI, which achieve agency through mechanisms like prompt chaining, conversation orchestration, and dynamic context management—a clear departure from the symbolic planning of the classical lineage.\\nThe third layer investigates Application Domains , exploring the practical deployment of agentic systems across fields such as healthcare [ 42 ] , finance [ 43 ] , scientific discovery [ 44 ] , and legal reasoning [ 45 ] . Our framework allows us to map these applications to the appropriate paradigm and analyze their unique implementation challenges.\\nThe current discourse on agentic AI suffers from the conceptual retrofitting illustrated in Figure 2 . Classical AI frameworks, such as the BDI model or perceive–plan–act–reflect (PPAR) loops, are often rhetorically applied but are fundamentally mismatched to the stochastic, non-symbolic, and context-driven nature of LLM-based agents [ 5 ] . Furthermore, existing reviews are often narrow in scope, lacking empirical comparisons or integrated governance insights. As summarized in Table 1 , current literature leaves substantial gaps in understanding the field’s current state.\\nThis review directly addresses these limitations through four integrated contributions:\\nA Novel Dual-Paradigm Taxonomy: We introduce and employ the framework in Figure 2 as our primary analytical tool, explicitly distinguishing symbolic and neural lineages to prevent conceptual retrofitting and enable accurate system classification.\\nArchitectural Clarification: We demystify the operational principles of modern neural frameworks (Section 4 ), explaining how they achieve agency through mechanisms like prompt chaining and conversation orchestration, rather than symbolic planning.\\nEmpirical Mapping: We conduct a systematic PRISMA-based literature review of 90 studies, categorizing them using our dual-paradigm framework to trace research trends and evaluate architectures by their appropriate standards.\\nGovernance Anchoring: We embed ethical, accountability, and alignment challenges within each paradigm of our taxonomy to ensure that safety considerations are discussed in the correct technological context (Section 7 ).\\nTo guide the reader through our analysis, the paper is structured to logically develop the argument for a dual-paradigm understanding of Agentic AI. We begin by establishing the necessary theoretical context in Section 2 , which explores the foundations of agency and introduces our core taxonomic framework. Section 3 then details the systematic methodology underpinning our literature review.\\nThe subsequent sections apply this framework to analyze the field: Section 4 reviews key architectural frameworks through our taxonomic lens, and Section 5 examines how different application domains influence paradigm selection. Section 6 presents a comprehensive paradigm-aware taxonomy of the literature, serving as a foundational reference and key output of our review. Section 7 investigates the paradigm-specific nature of ethical and governance challenges, leading directly into Section 8 , which outlines the critical research gaps identified by our analysis.\\nThe final sections synthesize our findings and look forward. Section 9 then charts an actionable research roadmap toward hybrid intelligence, building directly upon both the identified gaps and our stated contributions. Finally, Section 10 provides a final synthesis of our findings and their implications for the field.\\nThis structure is designed to first equip the reader with the necessary conceptual tools, then systematically analyze the landscape, and conclude by synthesizing the insights into a coherent vision for the future of Agentic AI.',\n",

Section 6 presents a comprehensive paradigm-aware taxonomy of the literature, serving as a foundational reference and key output of our review. Section 7 investigates the paradigm-specific nature of ethical and governance challenges, leading directly into Section 8 , which outlines the critical research gaps identified by our analysis.\\nThe final sections synthesize our findings and look forward. Section 9 then charts an actionable research roadmap toward hybrid intelligence, building directly upon both the identified gaps and our stated contributions. Finally, Section 10 provides a final synthesis of our findings and their implications for the field.\\nThis structure is designed to first equip the reader with the necessary conceptual tools, then systematically analyze the landscape, and conclude by synthesizing the insights into a coherent vision for the future of Agentic AI.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'The architectural history of agentic AI is not a linear progression but a branching into two distinct paradigms, as defined by our conceptual framework (Figure 2 ). This section delineates the theoretical and cognitive groundwork for both the Symbolic/Classical and Neural/Generative lineages, clarifying their foundational principles and highlighting the paradigm shift that separates them.\\nThe conceptual language for describing agency originated within the symbolic paradigm. The foundational constructs of autonomy and agency are essential for both lineages, though they are implemented in fundamentally different ways. Autonomy refers to a system’s ability to operate independently, free from direct human intervention, whereas agency encapsulates the notion of goal-directed behavior that incorporates intention, contextual awareness, and decision-making capabilities [ 50 , 38 ] . Agentic AI synthesizes these traits by initiating tasks, dynamically ranking goals, monitoring progress, and adjusting behavior through feedback loops [ 51 ] .\\nThese mechanisms parallel human executive functions such as planning, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility. They provide the high-level descriptive framework for intelligent behavior, which both symbolic and neural systems aim to achieve through divergent mechanisms.\\nThe symbolic lineage is characterized by explicit logic, algorithmic planning, and deterministic or probabilistic models. Its evolution provides the theoretical bedrock for pre-LLM autonomous systems.\\nMDPs provide the mathematical scaffolding for modeling environments with full state information [ 52 , 53 ] , a hallmark of early symbolic and classical statistical AI. An MDP is defined by a tuple (S, A, P, R), representing states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards. These systems operate effectively in deterministic, rule-based domains but lack the capacity for robust reasoning under uncertainty, anchoring them firmly in the symbolic paradigm.\\nPOMDPs extend MDPs by introducing probabilistic belief states to handle environments where the agent has incomplete information [ 54 , 55 ] . This was a key advancement, allowing symbolic agents to infer hidden states through observation and enabling more adaptive behavior. However, as illustrated in Figure 3 , this is still a form of algorithmic state estimation. The significant computational overhead of belief tracking limits their scalability and real-world application [ 56 , 57 ] , a fundamental constraint of the symbolic approach.\\nCognitive architectures like Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) and SOAR represent the pinnacle of the symbolic paradigm’s attempt to engineer agency. They explicitly model internal states and processes, as summarized in Table 2 . These systems directly implement a perceive-plan-act-reflect loop using symbolic representations, making them powerful but brittle and difficult to scale to complex, real-world environments. Their relationship to human cognitive functions is a direct, top-down mapping of symbolic logic.\\nThe neural lineage is built on a foundation of statistical learning from data, culminating in the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Its progression is marked by a move away from explicit logic toward emergent, stochastic behavior.\\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) represents a critical transition. It scales learning to high-dimensional inputs (like images and text) using neural networks [ 58 , 59 ] . DRL agents learn policies directly from data, moving away from hand-crafted symbolic rules. Methods such as PPO allow for fine-grained behavioral optimization [ 60 , 61 ] . As shown in Figure 4 , advancements like meta-DRL introduced generalization across tasks, a precursor to the adaptability required for modern agency. DRL is a bridge, using neural networks to learn the policies that symbolic systems would have to be explicitly programmed with.\\nThe emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) was not an evolution but a revolution that created the new neural paradigm. LLMs provided a powerful, general-purpose substrate for reasoning based on statistical prediction in a high-dimensional space of concepts. This enabled a fundamental architectural shift from designing cognitive agents to orchestrating generative pipelines.\\nFrameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI do not implement symbolic PPAR loops or BDI architectures. They represent a new paradigm of LLM Orchestration , where pre-trained models act as central executives that coordinate tasks through fundamentally different mechanisms, as detailed in Table 3 .\\nThis shift marks the definitive break from the symbolic tradition. Agency in the neural paradigm is an emergent property of prompt-driven orchestration, not a product of internal symbolic logic. The evolution of a personal assistant, depicted in Figure 5 , culminates in this new architecture.\\nThe most advanced manifestation of the neural paradigm is multi-agent orchestration. Frameworks like AutoGen [ 67 ] and LangGraph [ 81 ] coordinate diverse, modular agents through structured communication protocols. As visualized in Figure 6 , an orchestrator (often an LLM itself) acts as a context manager and task router, assessing the overall goal and dynamically assigning specialized subtasks to other agents.\\nThis architecture achieves scalability and complex problem-solving not through a single agent’s cognitive complexity, but through the emergent intelligence of a well-orchestrated system. It is the culmination of the neural lineage, firmly establishing the new orthodoxy of LLM-driven pipelines and completing the paradigm shift from the symbolic AI tradition.',\n",

This section outlines the systematic process used to identify, evaluate, and synthesize literature, with a specific focus on categorizing works according to the symbolic and neural lineages defined in our conceptual framework (Figure 2 ). It follows established review protocols to ensure reproducibility while accounting for the field’s rapid evolution.\\nThis study adopts the PRISMA 2020 framework (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) [ 82 , 83 ] , guiding all stages from search strategy to synthesis. The methodology is designed to capture and distinguish between the symbolic/classical and neural/generative lineages of agentic AI research across computer science, cognitive psychology, robotics, and ethics.\\nObjectives: This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of agentic AI systems through the following specific research objectives:\\nTo identify, classify, and synthesize literature based on the dual architectural paradigms (Symbolic vs. Neural) of Agentic AI.\\nTo examine the evolution of capabilities, applications, and performance metrics within and across each paradigm.\\nTo analyze governance frameworks and ethical challenges, contextualizing them within their respective architectural paradigms.\\nTo highlight paradigm-specific research gaps and propose informed future directions based on the synthesized evidence.\\nA multi-database search strategy was employed to identify literature across both historical symbolic and modern neural agentic AI research. Sources included: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, arXiv, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar.\\nThe search strategy employed a structured set of keyword clusters designed to comprehensively capture the core concepts associated with both architectural paradigms. To represent the Symbolic/Classical lineage, targeted terms included foundational concepts such as \"Cognitive architectures,\" \"BDI agent,\" \"SOAR,\" \"POMDP,\" \"symbolic planning,\" and \"multi-agent systems\" (in its traditional sense). Conversely, the Neural/Generative paradigm was captured through terms reflecting its contemporary emergence, such as \"LLM agent,\" \"AI orchestration,\" \"prompt chaining,\" \"tool-augmented LLM,\" \"multi-agent conversation,\" and specific framework names including \"AutoGen\" and \"LangChain.\" Finally, a set of General terms—\"Agentic AI,\" \"autonomous agent,\" and \"goal-directed AI\"—was used to ensure broad coverage and to capture literature that might bridge or transcend the paradigmatic divide.\\nBoolean operators were structured to optimize breadth and relevance (e.g., (\"autonomous agent\" OR \"agentic AI\") AND (\"large language model\" OR \"orchestration\" OR \"cognitive architecture\")).\\nThe search scope was interdisciplinary, targeting relevant fields from computer science to ethics. To capture the most current advancements in the rapidly evolving neural paradigm, the search included pre-print servers like arXiv, with these records being manually assessed for quality and relevance.\\nTo ensure the review’s methodological integrity and thematic relevance, predefined inclusion and exclusion parameters were applied during the screening process. These criteria were designed to capture high-quality literature from both paradigms of agentic AI.\\nThe literature search employed the following inclusion criteria to identify publications that contribute directly to the core themes of agentic AI architectures and applications. Specifically, we included peer-reviewed journal articles, conference proceedings, and formally published technical reports from recognized institutions. To capture the most recent advancements in the rapidly evolving neural paradigm, we also incorporated high-impact pre-prints from arXiv, which were manually screened for methodological rigor and citation impact, with a focus on those presenting novel architectures or frameworks. The scope of included work encompassed studies involving the design, implementation, or evaluation of autonomous agents, spanning both classical symbolic systems and modern LLM-orchestrated frameworks. All selected publications were required to be in English and published within the temporal window of January 2018 to March 2025.\\nTo ensure a focused and methodologically rigorous review, studies were excluded according to the following criteria. Non-English language publications were omitted. We also excluded non-peer-reviewed or informal sources such as opinion pieces, editorials, blog posts, and unverified online content. Furthermore, studies focused exclusively on generative AI (e.g., for image generation or text completion) without incorporating agentic features like goal-directedness, tool use, or multi-step autonomy were deemed out of scope. Finally, duplicate records retrieved from multiple databases were identified and removed to prevent redundancy in the analysis.\\nThese criteria ensured the retention of conceptually aligned and methodologically sound studies from both paradigms, preserving the review’s comprehensive scope. A summary is provided in Table 4 .\\nThe screening protocol adhered to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to ensure methodological transparency and reproducibility. Records were compiled from selected databases, yielding an initial pool of 165 items (157 from databases, 8 from supplemental sources).\\nFollowing deduplication, 120 unique records remained. Title and abstract screening excluded 42 studies due to irrelevance or insufficient focus on agentic AI. Full-text assessment confirmed 78 articles met all inclusion criteria.\\nIn alignment with PRISMA’s guidance for systematic reviews that require foundational context, a supplemental phase was conducted [ 82 ] . During thematic synthesis, 12 seminal theoretical papers from the symbolic paradigm (e.g., foundational works on MDPs by [ 39 ] and cognitive architectures by [ 84 ] ) were incorporated. These papers were essential for providing complete historical context for the taxonomic framework and understanding the symbolic lineage, though they were analyzed separately from contemporary neural paradigm research. This resulted in a final corpus of 90 publications for contextual and theoretical grounding, with 78 studies forming the core for analysis of contemporary trends.\\nThe process is illustrated in Figure 7 , which clearly distinguishes the primary systematic search from the supplemental inclusion of foundational context.\\nThe 78 studies forming the core of the review underwent thematic synthesis following the methodology described by Thomas and Harden [ 85 ] , with analysis specifically structured around the dual-paradigm framework.\\nOur analysis employed a multi-faceted methodological approach to systematically investigate the body of research. The initial phase involved paradigm classification , whereby each study was categorized according to its primary architectural paradigm—either Symbolic/Classical or Neural/Generative—based on the core operational mechanisms defined in our conceptual framework. Following this classification, we conducted a detailed framework mapping within each paradigm to group studies by their specific architectural approaches, including orchestration models (e.g., AutoGen, CrewAI), memory structures, and learning mechanisms. Building on this organized foundation, a cross-paradigm comparison was performed to identify fundamental differences in implementation, performance, and limitations between the two overarching paradigms. In parallel, we performed domain clustering to group applications by sector—such as healthcare, finance, robotics, and scientific discovery—which enabled the identification of performance patterns and deployment strategies both within and across paradigms. Finally, an ethical coding procedure was applied, using a structured lexicon to tag recurring themes related to governance, safety, transparency, and bias, with particular attention paid to how these ethical challenges manifest differently within each paradigm.\\nQualitative coding was supported by tools such as NVivo [ 86 ] , which enabled hierarchical theme identification and cross-paradigm analysis. Quantitative results were tabulated and compared within and across domains and paradigms to synthesize technical and operational insights.\\nThis paradigm-informed approach ensured a nuanced understanding of the current landscape of Agentic AI research, supporting both theoretical grounding and real-world applicability while maintaining the analytical rigor required for this review.\\nLimitations While this review provides a comprehensive synthesis of Agentic AI research, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the inherent temporal and scope dynamics of the field, particularly within the rapidly evolving neural paradigm, present a challenge; although our search extended to early 2025, some very recent developments may not be captured, a risk mitigated but not fully eliminated by the inclusion of pre-prints. Furthermore, our methodological approach required a contextual reference expansion through the supplemental inclusion of 12 seminal symbolic papers to ensure a robust theoretical framing of the classical lineage. We emphasize that these papers, analyzed separately from contemporary research, were used strictly for contextual and historical background and represent a deviation from a purely systematic retrieval process.\\nAdditional constraints arose from the nature of the subject matter itself. Transparency constraints were encountered as many state-of-the-art neural agentic systems operate as proprietary solutions with limited public documentation, meaning architectural details and performance metrics were sometimes incomplete or inferred from secondary sources. Methodological heterogeneity across the reviewed studies, with their varied evaluation metrics, also limited our ability to perform direct cross-study benchmarking, particularly between paradigms that employ fundamentally different performance measures. Finally, despite implementing rigorous classification criteria, the paradigm classification challenge of assigning hybrid or transitional architectures to a single paradigm may, in some cases, involve necessary simplification.\\nThese limitations collectively highlight the challenges of conducting systematic reviews in a nascent and fast-paced field with multiple co-existing paradigms. Our two-phase approach—a systematic review of contemporary research supplemented by a narrative inclusion of foundational symbolic context—was designed to balance methodological rigor with comprehensiveness while respecting the fundamental distinctions between these architectural paradigms.',\n",

The initial phase involved paradigm classification , whereby each study was categorized according to its primary architectural paradigm—either Symbolic/Classical or Neural/Generative—based on the core operational mechanisms defined in our conceptual framework. Following this classification, we conducted a detailed framework mapping within each paradigm to group studies by their specific architectural approaches, including orchestration models (e.g., AutoGen, CrewAI), memory structures, and learning mechanisms. Building on this organized foundation, a cross-paradigm comparison was performed to identify fundamental differences in implementation, performance, and limitations between the two overarching paradigms. In parallel, we performed domain clustering to group applications by sector—such as healthcare, finance, robotics, and scientific discovery—which enabled the identification of performance patterns and deployment strategies both within and across paradigms. Finally, an ethical coding procedure was applied, using a structured lexicon to tag recurring themes related to governance, safety, transparency, and bias, with particular attention paid to how these ethical challenges manifest differently within each paradigm.\\nQualitative coding was supported by tools such as NVivo [ 86 ] , which enabled hierarchical theme identification and cross-paradigm analysis. Quantitative results were tabulated and compared within and across domains and paradigms to synthesize technical and operational insights.\\nThis paradigm-informed approach ensured a nuanced understanding of the current landscape of Agentic AI research, supporting both theoretical grounding and real-world applicability while maintaining the analytical rigor required for this review.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'Limitations While this review provides a comprehensive synthesis of Agentic AI research, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the inherent temporal and scope dynamics of the field, particularly within the rapidly evolving neural paradigm, present a challenge; although our search extended to early 2025, some very recent developments may not be captured, a risk mitigated but not fully eliminated by the inclusion of pre-prints. Furthermore, our methodological approach required a contextual reference expansion through the supplemental inclusion of 12 seminal symbolic papers to ensure a robust theoretical framing of the classical lineage. We emphasize that these papers, analyzed separately from contemporary research, were used strictly for contextual and historical background and represent a deviation from a purely systematic retrieval process.\\nAdditional constraints arose from the nature of the subject matter itself. Transparency constraints were encountered as many state-of-the-art neural agentic systems operate as proprietary solutions with limited public documentation, meaning architectural details and performance metrics were sometimes incomplete or inferred from secondary sources. Methodological heterogeneity across the reviewed studies, with their varied evaluation metrics, also limited our ability to perform direct cross-study benchmarking, particularly between paradigms that employ fundamentally different performance measures. Finally, despite implementing rigorous classification criteria, the paradigm classification challenge of assigning hybrid or transitional architectures to a single paradigm may, in some cases, involve necessary simplification.\\nThese limitations collectively highlight the challenges of conducting systematic reviews in a nascent and fast-paced field with multiple co-existing paradigms. Our two-phase approach—a systematic review of contemporary research supplemented by a narrative inclusion of foundational symbolic context—was designed to balance methodological rigor with comprehensiveness while respecting the fundamental distinctions between these architectural paradigms.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'The rapid expansion of Agentic AI has produced a diverse yet fragmented body of research. This section synthesizes the extant literature through the lens of the dual-paradigm framework introduced in Figure 2 , analyzing how contributions are distributed across the symbolic/classical and neural/generative lineages. We organize and analyze the most influential contributions across foundational studies, architectural frameworks, and domain-specific applications, focusing on their operational mechanisms to clearly delineate the paradigm shift.\\nThe theoretical bedrock of Agentic AI is found in two distinct lineages, each with its own foundational breakthroughs. Landmark studies have shaped the conceptual and architectural foundations of both paradigms, spanning strategic reasoning, cognitive models, and alignment.\\nThese studies collectively mark the progression from explicit, algorithmic deliberation to emergent, stochastic intelligence. They serve as reference points for the fundamental differences in how adaptability, coordination, and strategic reasoning are implemented in each paradigm, illustrating the conceptual divide captured by our framework.\\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has solidified the neural/generative paradigm, which operates on principles fundamentally incompatible with its symbolic predecessor. Modern agentic frameworks leverage LLMs as generative engines within software pipelines, explicitly departing from classical cognitive loops. Their core innovation lies in dynamic context management, prompt engineering, and tool composition.\\nThis analysis underscores that these frameworks form the backbone of the neural paradigm, designed for practical task completion through orchestration, not for simulating internal cognitive processes. Mapping them to PPAR or BDI obscures their true innovative mechanics, which are defined by prompt-driven stochasticity, not algorithmic symbol manipulation.\\nAgentic AI frameworks are being deployed across sectors where autonomy and adaptability are essential. The choice of paradigm is critically influenced by domain-specific constraints—ethical, regulatory, or epistemic. The following implementations exemplify how each paradigm is applied.\\nThe application of Agentic AI reveals a distinct paradigm split influenced by the core requirements of each sector. In healthcare, where safety and compliance are paramount , applications diverge clearly along architectural lines. Symbolic systems, such as rule-based clinical decision support tools, are predominantly employed for predictable and auditable tasks. In contrast, the flexibility of neural paradigms is leveraged for tasks like generating structured medical reports [ 66 ] and powering on-premise edge agents [ 87 ] ; however, these neural frameworks are often contained within deterministic tool-chaining pipelines to ensure the reliability required in clinical settings.\\nThis pattern of complementary paradigm use is also evident in finance, a domain demanding high accuracy and auditability . Here, neural frameworks dominate tasks involving complex data synthesis and analysis. For instance, CrewAI’s role-based workflow is applied to market analysis [ 43 ] as it provides a clear, auditable trail of agent actions. Similarly, LlamaIndex-powered models for financial sentiment [ 79 ] demonstrate how neural systems use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground their stochastic outputs in verified data, thereby reducing hallucination. Despite this, symbolic systems maintain a critical role in high-frequency trading and core regulatory logic where absolute determinism is non-negotiable.\\nFinally, in scientific research, which requires profound epistemic rigor , the choice of paradigm is dictated by the nature of the intellectual task. The deployment of AutoGen to coordinate multi-agent conversations for economic research [ 69 ] exemplifies the neural paradigm’s strength in simulating collaborative, exploratory discovery and critique. This stands in direct contrast to the role of symbolic systems, which remain the bedrock for theorem proving and logical inference, highlighting a fundamental architectural choice between exploratory generation and deductive reasoning.\\nThese implementations demonstrate that the paradigm choice is not merely technical but is decisively shaped by domain-specific needs, validating the need for a clear taxonomic framework to classify and select appropriate architectures.\\nThe evolution of Agentic AI is increasingly characterized by a deliberate synthesis of architectural paradigms, moving beyond isolated approaches toward integrated systems that combine strengths while mitigating inherent limitations. This shift toward hybrid architectures represents the field’s maturation as it seeks to balance adaptability with reliability. Importantly, these trends are not broad truisms about any generation of AI, but rather specific architectural responses to challenges uniquely faced by large-scale, agentic systems.\\nThe most significant emerging trend is neuro-symbolic integration , which aims to formally bridge the reliable, deterministic reasoning of symbolic systems with the adaptive, generative capabilities of neural networks [ 88 ] . This effort transcends the well-documented limitations of both paradigms, potentially establishing a new hybrid category that leverages their complementary strengths.\\nA second and particularly distinctive direction is the exploration of decentralized agent networks . Here, blockchain-based coordination mechanisms are applied to multi-agent AI systems to provide verifiable governance, transparent decision-making, and resilient autonomy [ 89 ] . Unlike conventional centralized orchestrators, distributed consensus frameworks offer robustness against single points of failure, while also opening the possibility of economic coordination between heterogeneous agents through tokenized incentives. This line of research directly addresses questions of trust, accountability, and cooperative alignment—issues that become acute when scaling agentic AI across organizations or societal infrastructures.\\nComplementing these architectural innovations, advances in lifelong learning frameworks address a critical limitation of current LLM-based agents—their largely stateless nature [ 90 ] . By enabling continuous adaptation and durable knowledge retention, this trend effectively injects persistent memory, a concept foundational to symbolic AI, into neural architectures. This supports more context-aware, long-term, and resilient operation in dynamic environments.\\nCollectively, these emerging trends signal the field’s progression from debating paradigm superiority to architecting sophisticated hybrids. Far from generic insights, they constitute targeted responses to enduring limitations in current Agentic AI systems: brittle reasoning, centralized governance bottlenecks, and memory deficiencies. The resulting synthesis offers the most promising path toward developing Agentic AI systems that are simultaneously adaptable and reliable, creative and verifiable—capable of operating effectively in the complex, dynamic environments that characterize real-world applications.\\nA critical yet often underexplored aspect of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is the fundamental distinction in their coordination mechanisms. A deeper examination reveals that these strategies are a primary differentiator between the two paradigms, reflecting their core architectural principles: explicit algorithms in the symbolic paradigm versus emergent, stochastically-guided behavior in the neural paradigm.\\nWithin the Symbolic Paradigm , coordination is achieved through pre-defined, algorithmic protocols rooted in decades of distributed AI research. These protocols are engineered to ensure predictable, verifiable, and fault-tolerant interactions, making them indispensable for critical systems where correctness is paramount. A quintessential example is the Contract Net Protocol (CNP) [ 91 ] , a classic negotiation framework where a manager agent announces a task through a “call for proposals.” Other agents then evaluate their capabilities and submit bids, leading the manager to award the contract to the most suitable agent. This process, analogous to an auction, is extensively applied in domains like manufacturing and logistics scheduling. Another foundational strategy is the Blackboard System [ 92 ] , where a shared memory space acts as a central coordination point. Specialist agents, akin to experts surrounding a physical blackboard, monitor this space for relevant data and contribute their expertise incrementally to build towards a solution. This approach is highly effective for complex, unstructured problems like medical diagnosis or signal interpretation. Furthermore, Market-Based Approaches facilitate coordination through a virtual economy where agents buy and sell services or resources, providing a decentralized method for resource allocation in networked systems.\\nIn direct opposition, coordination within the Neural Paradigm is not typically governed by hard-coded protocols. Instead, it emerges as a property of structured conversation and prompt-driven orchestration [ 93 , 94 , 95 ] . Here, a central orchestrator (often an LLM itself) or the agents themselves leverage their generative capabilities to dynamically assign roles, manage dialogue, and synthesize results. This can manifest in several distinct patterns. Conversation-Based Coordination [ 96 , 97 , 98 ] , exemplified by frameworks like AutoGen, achieves collaboration through structured conversational loops where agents with defined roles interact within a group chat, with the LLM’s context window managing the interaction state. A more explicit variant is the Role-Based Workflow [ 99 ] (e.g., CrewAI), where a higher-level orchestrator assigns tasks based on pre-defined roles and goals, though the routing decisions are still driven by LLM-based reasoning rather than deterministic algorithms. Lastly, Dynamic Context Management [ 100 , 81 ] (e.g., LangGraph) implements coordination through state machines that control information flow between nodes; the graph structure defines possible paths, but the specific execution is determined stochastically by the LLM’s output at each step.\\nThe fundamental dichotomy between these coordination strategies is summarized in Table 5 , which highlights the core operational differences.\\nThis analysis confirms that the paradigm shift extends to the very fabric of multi-agent coordination. The symbolic paradigm offers verifiable reliability through rigorously engineered protocols, while the neural paradigm offers adaptable emergence through learned conversation patterns. This critical distinction is essential for understanding the capabilities, risks, and appropriate applications of modern MAS, thereby further validating the necessity of the dual-paradigm framework presented in this survey.\\nThe evaluation of Agentic AI systems presents a fundamental challenge that distinguishes it from the assessment of traditional AI models. As the reviewer rightly notes, simple metrics like accuracy are wholly insufficient. Measuring “agency” requires quantifying a system’s capacity for sustained, goal-directed behavior in dynamic environments, necessitating a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that accounts for paradigm-specific mechanisms of action.\\nThe core challenge lies in the fact that agency is not a monolithic property but a spectrum encompassing autonomy , task success , efficiency , and robustness . Consequently, evaluation must be tailored to the architectural paradigm.\\nIn the Symbolic Paradigm , evaluation has historically focused on verifiability . Key metrics include Goal Completion Fidelity , which measures the percentage of pre-defined sub-goals correctly achieved in a plan, and Plan Optimality , which compares the cost (e.g., time, steps) of an agent’s generated plan against a known optimal solution. Furthermore, assessment involves verifying Logical Soundness through formal methods to ensure rule sets cannot derive contradictory or unsafe actions, and rigorously testing Edge Case Handling against rare but critical scenarios either explicitly encoded in or missing from the agent’s knowledge base.\\nConversely, in the Neural Paradigm , evaluation is inherently more complex due to inherent stochasticity. While benchmarks like AgentBench [ 101 ] and GAIA [ Mialon2023GAIA ] represent a shift towards holistic assessment, they have limitations. Metrics must be designed to capture emergent capabilities and failures. This includes evaluating Long-Horizon Task Success on complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., “research a topic and write a report with citations”), often measured by final outcome quality as judged by humans or a powerful LLM “judge.” Other critical dimensions are Context Window and Memory Management , which assess an agent’s ability to utilize information across extended interactions; Tool Use Proficiency , encompassing tool selection accuracy, call sequence efficiency, and error recovery; Robustness to Prompts , testing consistency across instruction rephrasings and resilience to injection attacks; and practical Cost and Latency metrics, measuring computational expense (e.g., total tokens, API calls) and time-to-completion, which are crucial for real-world deployment.\\nA comprehensive evaluation framework for Agentic AI must therefore integrate these dimensions. It is not enough for an agent to eventually succeed at a task; it must do so efficiently, reliably, and in a manner that is transparent and auditable where required. This typically involves a synergistic combination of automated metrics (e.g., success rate, number of steps), human evaluation for qualitative judgment of output coherence and usefulness, and adversarial testing (e.g., “red teaming”) to probe for specific failure modes like hallucination or goal divergence.\\nThis paradigm-aware approach to evaluation—where symbolic systems are judged on verifiability and neural systems on robust adaptability—is essential for the responsible development and deployment of autonomous agents. It moves the field beyond simple benchmarks towards a more nuanced understanding of what it means for an AI system to be truly “agentic.”\\nSynthesizing the literature through our dual-paradigm framework reveals several fundamental distinctions and clear trajectories for the field of Agentic AI. The analysis demonstrates that paradigm divergence is fundamental ; rather than representing evolutionary stages, the symbolic and neural lineages constitute parallel development paths characterized by fundamentally different operational mechanics—algorithmic reasoning versus stochastic orchestration. This architectural divergence emerges as the most critical factor in determining any agentic system’s inherent capabilities and limitations.\\nThis division naturally leads to the principle that mechanism determines application . The choice between paradigms is far from arbitrary but is instead dictated by domain requirements. Symbolic architectures demonstrate particular excellence in domains demanding absolute reliability, verifiability, and safety, such as core regulatory systems and safety-critical controls. Conversely, neural architectures thrive in environments requiring adaptability, sophisticated pattern recognition, and operation on unstructured data, exemplified by creative research applications and complex customer interactions.\\nLooking toward the future, the evidence indicates that the frontier lies in hybridization . Emerging research trends do not suggest the ultimate victory of one paradigm over the other but rather point toward their strategic integration. The next significant advancement will likely emerge from hybrid architectures that embed symbolic reasoning modules within neural orchestration frameworks, effectively mitigating the weaknesses of pure neural approaches—such as hallucination and lack of verifiability—while preserving their adaptive strengths.\\nCollectively, these insights, structured by the dual-paradigm framework, provide a cohesive and accurate narrative for understanding the field’s present state and future direction. This approach moves beyond a simple catalog of technologies to establish a coherent theory of architectural design in Agentic AI, offering researchers and practitioners a principled foundation for system development and evaluation.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Agentic AI systems have transitioned from theoretical research to critical production deployments. This section analyzes these deployments through the lens of our dual-paradigm framework, examining how domain-specific constraints—such as safety, regulation, and real-world interaction—dictate the choice of architectural paradigm and shape implementation priorities. The progression from automation to autonomy is not a function of evolutionary stage but of selecting the appropriate paradigm for the task’s constraints.\\nTo provide a structured analysis, Table 6 maps key domains against their dominant architectural paradigm, primary constraints, and illustrative implementations, creating a comparative schema based on mechanistic choice rather than chronological progression.\\nThe diversity of these deployments reflects a key insight: the architectural paradigm is a strategic response to domain-specific pressures. For instance, healthcare applications heavily favor symbolic or highly constrained deterministic approaches. This prioritizes safety, accuracy, and auditability—a necessity in high-stakes, regulated environments—over the generative flexibility of pure neural systems.\\nConversely, domains like education leverage the neural paradigm for its core strength: generating adaptive, personalized, and context-aware interactions that are difficult to pre-program with symbolic rules.\\nFinance and Legal applications demonstrate a crucial middle ground: they are built on neural orchestration frameworks but are heavily constrained by symbolic mechanisms (e.g., role-based workflows, rigorous retrieval from verified sources) to mitigate the risks of hallucination and ensure compliance. Robotics presents the most explicit hybrid model, pairing symbolic systems for safety-critical low-level control with neural systems for high-level coordination and adaptation.\\nFurthermore, this paradigm-driven analysis reveals critical cross-domain challenges that must be addressed in future research. Chief among these is the need for paradigm-specific governance frameworks . The operationalization of agentic systems requires tailored policy approaches that account for each paradigm’s distinct risks: governing symbolic systems involves verifying their logical structures, while governing neural systems necessitates auditing training data, prompts, and outputs for stochastic failures—a challenge further compounded in hybrid architectures.\\nEqually critical are the emerging challenges in security and resilience . As these systems become integrated into critical infrastructure, they represent prime targets for adversarial attacks, though the attack vectors differ fundamentally by paradigm. Symbolic systems face exploitation of logical flaws and rule manipulation, while neural systems remain vulnerable to prompt injection, data poisoning, and other inference-time attacks that exploit their stochastic nature.\\nFinally, the paradigm divide fundamentally shapes human-AI collaboration . Effective interface design must account for these architectural differences: interacting with symbolic systems requires understanding their internal logic and state representations, whereas engaging with neural systems involves carefully steering context and interpreting often opaque, generative outputs—requiring distinct approaches to oversight and interpretability.\\nA critical capability that distinguishes agentic AI from passive models is their ability to interact with and manipulate external tools and data sources via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) [ 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 ] . This functionality is the bridge between an agent’s internal reasoning and tangible action in the real world. The nature of this integration is, as our framework predicts, paradigm-dependent.\\nIn the Symbolic Paradigm , tool use is typically hard-coded and deterministic. Agents call specific functions with predefined parameters based on explicit logical rules. This is prevalent in safety-critical domains like healthcare, where agents interact with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems using strict, auditable APIs (e.g., HL7 FHIR standards for reading/writing patient data) or clinical decision support tools with fixed input-output schemas [ 113 , 114 ] .\\nIn the Neural Paradigm , tool use is orchestrated and generative. Frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen use the LLM’s ability to understand natural language instructions to dynamically select and call appropriate tools from a suite of available options. The LLM [ 115 , 116 ] generates the API call parameters (e.g., formulating a database query, crafting a search query) based on its context, which is then executed by the framework. This allows for immense flexibility but introduces risks of malformed calls or unexpected outputs.\\nTable 7 [ 117 , 118 , 119 ] provides a non-exhaustive overview of the types of real-world tools and APIs that agentic systems are currently being integrated with, categorized by their primary domain and function.\\nThis integration enables agents to move beyond text generation to become truly functional systems. For instance, a neural agent using AutoGen could read an email via the Outlook API, extract key tasks, write code to solve them using a Python tool, and then post the results to a Slack channel—all within a single orchestrated workflow. Conversely, a symbolic agent in a manufacturing context might reliably call a single, well-defined API to adjust a machine’s parameters based on its rigid internal state model.\\nIn conclusion, agentic AI is not a monolithic force but a set of distinct architectural paradigms.

       "    'paragraphs': 'As Agentic AI systems gain autonomy and are deployed in critical domains, they introduce a complex spectrum of ethical and governance concerns [ 120 , 9 , 174 ] . However, a critical oversight in current discourse is the treatment of these challenges as monolithic. The risks and requisite mitigation strategies differ profoundly between the symbolic and neural paradigms, demanding a paradigm-aware approach to oversight and interdisciplinary collaboration.\\nA synthesis of these issues is presented in Table 9 , which expands upon standard taxonomies by outlining the core challenges and, most importantly, their paradigm-specific manifestations and governance implications.\\nAnalysis and Summary\\nThe bifurcation of ethical challenges detailed in Table 9 leads to several critical and interconnected conclusions. First, it becomes evident that effective governance cannot be architecturally agnostic . Regulation and ethical oversight must be predicated on the underlying paradigm; a requirement for \"full explainability,\" for instance, is feasible for a symbolic system but may be technologically impossible for a pure neural agent, thus necessitating the development of alternative compliance mechanisms.\\nFurthermore, the rise of hybrid systems compounds ethical complexity . An agent that blends paradigms inherently inherits the governance challenges of both. A neuro-symbolic architecture, for example, requires a framework capable of auditing its deterministic symbolic logic while simultaneously monitoring its neural components for stochastic failures, creating a significantly more demanding oversight burden.\\nConversely, the attribution gap presents a specific crisis for the neural paradigm . The fundamental question of \"Who is liable?\" is most acute here, as its diffuse and stochastic nature directly challenges legal frameworks built on principles of direct causation and intent. This may ultimately require the establishment of new forms of strict liability for developers and operators.\\nFinally, these distinctions mean that effective human-AI collaboration is inherently paradigm-dependent . Designing appropriate human oversight requires a deep understanding of the agent’s core mechanics. The process of overseeing a symbolic agent is analogous to supervising a junior programmer—it involves checking their logical steps. In stark contrast, overseeing a neural agent is more akin to supervising a brilliant but unpredictable intern—it requires carefully steering their context and interpreting their often-opaque outputs.\\nAddressing the ethical and governance issues of Agentic AI is essential to harness its transformative potential. However, this analysis demonstrates that a nuanced, paradigm-specific approach is not just beneficial but necessary. Blanket policies will inevitably fail. The path forward requires technical standards, legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines that are as sophisticated and differentiated as the technologies they aim to govern.\\nThis paradigm-specific framing, however, remains incomplete without explicit consideration of policy frameworks that account for the degrees of agency and autonomy in Agentic AI systems, an issue we address next.\\nAn overlooked but critical dimension of ethical and governance discourse is the explicit development of policy frameworks tailored to agentic AI . Current governance proposals often extend existing AI regulations to cover autonomous systems, but they seldom distinguish between systems that merely generate outputs and those that exercise agency in decision-making . For agentic AI, the challenge lies in defining and operationalizing levels of autonomy and clarifying their governance implications.\\nPolicy mechanisms must therefore incorporate criteria that distinguish different levels of agency.\\nTable 10 summarizes a proposed taxonomy of agency in Agentic AI, outlining the\\ncharacteristics of assistive, shared, and delegated forms of agency alongside their governance implications.\\nAccordingly, governance must move beyond paradigm-specific risk analysis toward a taxonomy of agency , where ethical principles and legal accountability mechanisms scale with the degree of autonomy.

The goal is to forge a new class of hybrid systems that leverage the reliability of symbolic reasoning and the adaptability of neural generation.\\nNeuro-Symbolic Integration as the Keystone: The most profound progress will come from research that successfully couples neural networks for perception and pattern recognition with symbolic engines for reasoning and constraint checking. This is the most promising path to overcoming the brittleness of pure symbolism and the opacity of pure neural approaches.\\nParadigm-Specialized Roles in Ecosystems: Future multi-agent ecosystems [ 154 , 155 ] will not be homogenous. They will consist of specialized agents—some highly neural for creative tasks, some highly symbolic for regulatory compliance—that communicate through standardized protocols. The orchestration of such hybrid swarms is a critical research frontier.\\nA Dual-Track Approach to Governance: The development of safety and governance mechanisms [ 9 ] must continue on two tracks: advancing formal methods for symbolic verifiability and developing new statistical, training-based methods for neural alignment.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Agentic AI represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the design of intelligent systems, but its rapid evolution has led to a fragmented and often anachronistic understanding of the field. This review has addressed this confusion by introducing and validating a novel conceptual framework: the existence of two distinct lineages of Agentic AI—the Symbolic/Classical and the Neural/Generative —each with fundamentally different operational mechanics, strengths, and limitations.\\nOur analysis demonstrates that the common practice of conceptual retrofitting —describing modern LLM-orchestrated agents with the language of symbolic systems (e.g., PPAR loops, BDI)—obscures their true nature and impedes progress. Through a systematic, paradigm-aware review of the literature, we have established three central tenets. First, the architectural divide is both real and meaningful ; symbolic systems excel in environments requiring safety, verifiability, and explicit logic (e.g., healthcare, robotics control), while neural systems thrive in domains requiring adaptability, pattern recognition, and operation on unstructured data (e.g., finance, creative research) (Sections 5 , 6 ).\\nFurthermore, this divide dictates that governance must be paradigm-specific . The ethical challenges and requisite mitigation strategies differ profoundly between paradigms, meaning accountability for a symbolic system involves auditing its logic, whereas for a neural system, it necessitates auditing its training data and prompts. This renders a one-size-fits-all approach to AI ethics fundamentally insufficient (Section 7 ).\\nCritically, our findings indicate that the most productive path forward is hybrid, not isolated . The most pressing research gaps and promising future directions lie not in the isolated improvement of either paradigm, but in their strategic integration into neuro-symbolic architectures that leverage the complementary strengths of symbolic reliability and neural adaptability (Sections 8 , 9 ).\\nThis dual-paradigm framework provides the essential analytical lens to move the field beyond a simple catalog of technologies toward a coherent theory of architectural design in Agentic AI. It offers researchers, engineers, and policymakers a precise vocabulary and a functional taxonomy to classify systems, evaluate their capabilities and risks appropriately, and make informed design choices.\\nUltimately, the development of Agentic AI is not merely a technical challenge—it is a sociotechnical one. Its success will depend on whether we can architect systems that are not only powerful but also trustworthy. This requires a conscious and deliberate effort to build hybrid intelligence—systems that are both adaptable and reliable, both creative and sound. By recognizing and embracing the distinct nature of these two architectural lineages, we can steer this transformative technology toward a future where agentic systems truly serve as trusted collaborators in scientific discovery (understanding), in providing fair and accessible services (equity), and in forming the robust, verifiable backbone of critical infrastructure (resilience).',\n",

This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of 90 studies (2018–2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic: symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance). Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both adaptable and reliable.

       "    'paragraphs': 'High-fidelity simulations underpin design and decision-making across many areas of computational science and engineering. However, resolving transient dynamics with fine spatial meshes is still expensive when long horizons, high frequencies, or repeated solves over parameter sets are required. Surrogate models have therefore become popular as a means to accelerate inference while retaining accuracy where it matters, from fluids and granular flow to materials and mechanics (Forrester et\\xa0al., 2008 ; Herrmann & Kollmannsberger, 2024 ) .\\nSeveral approaches to surrogate modeling exist: classical Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) compress dynamics via low-rank bases (e.g., POD/Galerkin) or regression in latent coordinates (Benner et\\xa0al., 2015 ; Quarteroni et\\xa0al., 2016 ) ; Gaussian-process and Kriging surrogates excel with limited data and quantified uncertainty (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006 ; Sacks et\\xa0al., 1989 ; Forrester et\\xa0al., 2008 ) ; Deep Learning (DL) surrogates, ranging from convolutional encoder-decoder models to sequence models and neural operators, aim to learn solution operators or time-advancement rules directly from data, offering mesh- and geometry-agnostic generalization in favorable settings, and they scale to large datasets and complex, nonlinear regimes (Ronneberger et\\xa0al., 2015 ; Shi et\\xa0al., 2015 ; Li et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Lu et\\xa0al., 2019 ; Kovachki et\\xa0al., 2023 ) .\\nHowever, each class of approaches has its own inherent limitations. ROMs can struggle with strongly nonlinear phenomena and often require intrusive projection or stabilization (Benner et\\xa0al., 2015 ; Quarteroni et\\xa0al., 2016 ) . Neural operators and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown strong results for wave propagation and inverse problems, yet they frequently rely on global transforms or explicit PDE supervision (Li et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Raissi et\\xa0al., 2018 ; Cuomo et\\xa0al., 2022 ) . At high frequency, global spectral layers must resolve short wavelengths, and PINN training can become stiff due to competing loss terms and the need for accurate residuals on fine collocation sets (Kovachki et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Krishnapriyan et\\xa0al., 2021 ; Wang et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Maddu et\\xa0al., 2021 ) . Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly suitable for grid-like data, but become cumbersome when simulating generic domains with complex shapes (Bronstein et\\xa0al., 2017 ) .\\nRecently, a promising alternative to the models discussed above has emerged in the form of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). They provide a powerful framework for surrogate modeling on both structured and unstructured meshes and possess several properties that make them particularly suitable for representing physical phenomena. For instance, they naturally incorporate locality by aggregating information from neighboring nodes and support weight sharing in a way that is inherently invariant to node ordering (Gilmer et\\xa0al., 2017 ; Zaheer et\\xa0al., 2018 ; Battaglia et\\xa0al., 2018 ) . These features align closely with the behavior of most physical systems, where locality and invariance are fundamental principles.\\nBased on this paradigm, several simulators have been developed, among which the Graph Network Simulator (GNS) and MeshGraphNet stand out as the most promising. While differing mainly in the graph construction method, they both excel at simulating complex phenomena such as fluid dynamics, thanks to message passing and graph-to-graph updates to generate subsequent time steps of a simulation (Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Pfaff et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Fortunato et\\xa0al., 2022 ) .\\nDespite this progress, applications of GNN surrogates to structural problems, particularly dynamic ones, remain comparatively limited. Existing work often focuses on static or time-independent PDEs, quasi-static responses, or settings where displacements are large relative to the geometric scale (Chou et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Gladstone et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Zhao et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Deshpande et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Herrmann & Kollmannsberger, 2024 ) . However, a general framework capable of handling dynamic events and micro-scale displacements has not yet been proposed. The latter aspect, namely micro-scale displacements, introduces several numerical challenges: finite-difference velocities computed from absolute nodal positions can suffer from catastrophic cancellation when subtracting nearly equal floating-point numbers, which degrades derivative accuracy and destabilizes long rollouts (Higham, 2002 ) .\\nTo address these gaps, we introduce the Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of structural dynamics. The design is general and not restricted to any specific structural class; in this paper, we evaluate it on guided wave dynamics, an application that is both practically relevant - for example, in fields like structural health monitoring - and numerically demanding, due to the need for fine meshes and spatial discretizations to obtain accurate results (Rose, 1999 ; Cawley, 2024 ) . GNSS combines three ingredients tailored to structural simulations: (i) a local-coordinate formulation that expresses nodal kinematics in node-fixed frames to stabilize finite-difference velocities at micro-scale displacements; (ii) a sign-aware acceleration loss that discourages phase flips and improves long-horizon stability; and (iii) a wavelength-informed connectivity radius that aligns the message-passing neighborhood with physically meaningful interaction scales (e.g., a fraction of the bending-wave wavelength), thereby leveraging locality without oversmoothing (Langer et\\xa0al., 2017 ) . Together, these choices preserve the benefits of graph locality, while mitigating failure modes observed when applying off-the-shelf GNN simulators to structural dynamics problems involving small displacements.\\nWe benchmarked GNSS on a numerical case study involving wave propagation in a clamped beam, using a dataset generated through finite element simulations. Our model accurately predicts wave propagation during the rollout phase and generalizes across different loading conditions, outperforming traditional GNNs based on absolute nodal positions.\\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the implementation of GNSS. Section 3 introduces the case study used to validate the proposed method and discusses the results.

A comprehensive treatment of these theoretical foundations is beyond the scope of this paper; instead, the focus is on adapting and applying the GN framework to structural dynamics. Accordingly, this section first introduces basic graph definitions, then outlines the GN paradigm, and finally presents the specific GN-based architecture developed for structural dynamic analysis.\\nA graph 𝒢 \\\\mathcal{G} consists of a set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges that define connections between nodes.

The degree of a node is defined as the number of edges incident to that node.

The node feature vector associated with node n n , denoted by 𝐱 n ∈ ℝ d \\\\mathbf{x}_{n}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} , represents some measurable properties of the node. Similarly, the edge feature vectors encode the relationship between connected nodes. Given the feature vectors, the graph can be defined as G = ( 𝑽 , 𝑬 ) G=(\\\\bm{V},\\\\bm{E})\\nEarly neural architectures for graphs, such as the GNN model proposed in Scarselli et\\xa0al. ( 2009 ) ’s work, extended neural computation to structured graph domains using an iterative, equilibrium-based message-passing scheme. Each node updates its state by aggregating information from its neighbors until convergence. These models have proven effective for representing physical systems with complex, irregular topologies, where traditional architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed for structured grid-like data, are inadequate. GNNs generalize the concept of convolution to graph domains, making them well-suited for applications in fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and materials science (Battaglia et\\xa0al., 2018 ; Pfaff et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Wong et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Choi & Kumar, 2024 ; Li et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Zhao et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Gulakala et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Shivaditya et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Bronstein et\\xa0al., 2017 ; Wu et\\xa0al., 2020 ) .\\nA key strength of GNNs in modeling physical systems lies in their inductive biases. These include the representation of local interactions through message passing, the sharing of weights across the graph, and invariance to node permutations. Such biases naturally reflect physical principles such as locality, translational symmetry, and conservation laws (Battaglia et\\xa0al., 2018 ) .\\nThe GN framework (Battaglia et\\xa0al., 2018 ) generalizes and unifies multiple GNN-based architectures such as message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), interaction networks, and relation networks. Unlike classical GNNs, GNs explicitly decompose the graph update process into three modular functions: edge update, node update, and global update. This modular graph-to-graph transformation enables flexible and expressive modeling capabilities, which are particularly beneficial in physical simulation tasks (Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al., 2020 ) .\\nGiven as input a system’s state described by a graph 𝒮 = ( 𝑿 , 𝑹 ) \\\\mathcal{S}=(\\\\bm{X},\\\\bm{R}) , a GN produces an updated graph 𝒮 ′ = ( 𝑿 ′ , 𝑹 ′ ) \\\\mathcal{S}^{\\\\prime}=(\\\\bm{X}^{\\\\prime},\\\\bm{R}^{\\\\prime}) of identical topology representing the updated state of the system. 𝑿 \\\\bm{X} and 𝑹 \\\\bm{R} describe the physical properties and relationships of the system, respectively. The architecture typically follows an encode-process-decode paradigm (Battaglia et\\xa0al., 2018 ) , where raw inputs are encoded into latent node and edge embeddings, iteratively processed through message passing, and decoded into physically meaningful outputs.\\nThe encoding phase is described in Equation 1 . During this step, the physical properties and relationship describing the state are embedded into a higher-dimensional continuous space:\\nHere, N N is the number of nodes, d d is the number of properties for each node, k k is the number of relationships for each edge, and the h h -dimensional space is the latent space . This initial transformation not only homogenizes the feature space, but also allows the network to capture local patterns that are crucial for the learning task (Scarselli et\\xa0al., 2009 ; Gilmer et\\xa0al., 2017 ) .\\nMessage passing is the phase during which information is processed and exchanged among the different nodes of the system. It consists of updating the latent features of the graph through three steps:\\nMessage Construction (Equation 2 ): The updated edge features (also called message ) are obtained by combining the old information of the edge and the two nodes connected to it:\\nMessage Aggregation (Equation 3 ): For each node, an aggregated message is computed; this is obtained by combining all the messages related to node i i :\\nHere, 𝒩 \\u200b ( i ) \\\\mathcal{N}(i) represents the set of nodes linked to node i i .\\nNode Update (Equation 4 ): During this final step, the old node feature vector is combined with the aggregated message to obtain the updated node features:\\nEquation 5 describes the entire message passing pipeline concisely:\\nIn Equations 2 – 5 , the symbols ϕ , ψ , γ \\\\phi,\\\\,\\\\psi,\\\\,\\\\gamma represent arbitrary operands which are part of the architectural choice when designing a GN.\\nThe whole message passing procedure is typically repeated M > 1 M>1 times. This hyperparameter defines the degree of information propagation through the network, and thus the depth of the GN, as visually represented in Figure 1 . Information spread is usually represented through a computation graph, which describes how the embedding of each node is iteratively updated through message passing. Each layer of the computation graph carries out a message-passing operation; by applying this process recursively across layers, the network is able to represent both local interactions and more complex, higher-order relationships within the graph (Gilmer et\\xa0al., 2017 ; Battaglia et\\xa0al., 2018 ) .\\nDuring the decoding phase, the information stored in the latent representation is converted to task-specific predictions, such as node-level, edge-level, or graph-level outputs (Battaglia et\\xa0al., 2018 ) . For example, referring to the case of GNS and MeshGraphNet, the decoder performs a single node-level task by transforming the updated node features into a physical quantity at each node, the acceleration.\\nIn Figure 2 , our GNSS is presented. This framework is a modified version of the GNS developed by Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) , specifically adapted for structural simulations. Figure 2 (a) shows the Rollout , namely the procedure used to simulate the trajectory of the system: an initial configuration X 0 X_{0} is provided, then the GNSS is iteratively applied T Δ \\u200b t p \\u200b h \\\\frac{T}{\\\\Delta t_{ph}} times to predict the trajectory from physical time 0 to physical time T T . Δ \\u200b t ph \\\\Delta t_{\\\\mathrm{ph}} is the fixed timestep size adopted in the numerical simulations used to generate all trajectories in the dataset. Figure 2 (b) expands the operation involved at each time step t t , during which the GNSS performs the whole encode-process-decode paradigm to retrieve the updated nodal information (accelerations). Lastly, Figure 2 (c) details the processing phase, i.e., message passing, showing the procedure for a single passing step; as introduced above, message passing is recursively repeated M M times.\\nIn what follows, we detail the GNSS operations shown in Figure 2 (b)–(c).\\nThe pipeline — from graph construction to position update — is described for a single\\nsimulation time step t t ; accordingly, all intermediate quantities are evaluated at t t ,\\nand the output corresponds to the updated state at t + 1 t+1 . Because a single GNSS pass\\nperforms multiple rounds of message passing, we denote the m m -th round by the\\nsuperscript (m) . To avoid clutter, we omit the time index; unless otherwise stated,\\nall expressions are understood at time t t .\\nThe pre-processing phase is responsible for representing the information stored in the initial configuration of the system into a graph structure ready to be processed by the GN.\\nThe representation of the system naturally follows from the choice of a graph-based model. The continuous structure is discretized into a set of points , each capturing the local physical properties of its neighborhood, while the interactions among these points are expressed as relationships . Throughout the following description, we will denote a point in the discretized structure as x x , and its associated relationship as r i \\u200b j r_{ij} , representing the underlying physical properties. In contrast, the terms node v i v_{i} and edge e i \\u200b j e_{ij} will refer to the corresponding latent features, i.e., the latent graph representation used within the model.\\nRegarding the relationship between those points, the primary idea behind the graph construction proposed by Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) is that, typically, entities in physical systems are influenced by their neighbors. This natural behavior is reflected in the graph structure by establishing edges only between nodes that are sufficiently close. In practice, this is achieved by defining a connectivity radius that sets the maximum allowable distance for two nodes to be connected, as shown in Figure 3 .\\nOnce the graph’s topology is defined, each node i i of the graph is associated with a feature vector storing physical information. Following the implementation proposed by Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) , the point feature vector stores information about the velocity context and the type of particle related to the node. As demonstrated by Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) , including not only the current velocity of a point, but also the velocities from previous timesteps, greatly improves the performance of the model. This information is stored in a tensor as shown in Equation 6 :\\nHere, t t is the current timestep, and 𝐩 ˙ i ( t ) \\\\prescript{(t)}{}{\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{p}}}_{i} is the velocity of point i i at time t t , d d is the dimension of the space, and n n is the number of previous velocities considered (in addition to the current one). This is a hyperparameter, and is usually set to n = 4 n=4 as suggested by Choi & Kumar ( 2024 ) . The velocities are calculated via finite differences as shown in Equation 7 :\\nwhere 𝐩 i ( t ) \\\\prescript{(t)}{}{{\\\\mathbf{p}}}_{i} is the position of point i i at time t t and Δ \\u200b t \\\\Delta t is the timestep size. The timestep size used in the algorithm is set to 1, as non-dimensional time quantities are preferred during prediction. This unit timestep size corresponds to a physical timestep Δ \\u200b t p \\u200b h \\\\Delta t_{ph} implicitly defined by the one used in the training dataset. Consequently, the timestep size adopted in the numerical simulations must remain fixed and identical across all trajectories in the dataset.\\nThe framework is designed to account for different types of particles. This information is required by the model to correctly handle entities playing different roles in the simulation, and is stored in a vector 𝐟 \\\\mathbf{f} . This vector has 16 components and is created through an embedding layer.\\nIn our model, we exploit this structure to inform the prediction mechanism about the constraint of the structural simulation. Thanks to this choice, we can simply assign arbitrary IDs to different types of constraints, and the model will optimize the weights of the embedding layer (i.e., the 16 components of 𝐟 \\\\mathbf{f} ) to best represent the different entities according to their behavior. For example, we can assign an ID to the free portion (nodes) of the structure, another ID to nodes where a prescribed motion is applied, and another ID to the region of application of BCs. This choice allows us to simplify the feature vector proposed by Choi & Kumar ( 2024 ) by eliminating the information about the distance from the boundaries that was given for each node. Additionally, this allows us to model different types of boundaries by assigning different IDs to them (clamp, pin, etc.).\\nAll the properties listed above are included in a point state vector, as shown in Equation 8 :\\nHere, 𝐩 ˙ i ≤ t \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{p}}_{i}^{\\\\leq t} is the flattened vector of velocities history. For a representative 2D case, considering the current velocity and 4 additional velocities and the previous timesteps, the point feature vector is composed of 26 elements: 5 components for velocity along direction x x , 5 for velocity along direction y y , and 16 for the type embedding.\\nMoreover, the interaction between connected points i i and j j is represented by their distance in the physical space and their displacement in the current timestep, both normalized by the connectivity radius R R , as shown in Equation 9 :\\nThe distance provides information about the level of interaction between the two points, while the displacement gives a direction to the relationship.\\nTypically, GNs represent displacements in an absolute coordinate system shared by the entire physical system (Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Choi & Kumar, 2024 ) . While this approach is well-suited to domains commonly simulated with GNs, such as granular flow and fluid dynamics, it can be problematic in structural mechanics. In structural simulations, load-induced displacements are often several orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the system. This scale mismatch can cause numerical issues when derivatives (e.g., velocities) are computed via finite differences. In particular, subtracting two large, nearly equal floating-point numbers (absolute positions at successive timesteps) may lead to a loss of significant digits, a phenomenon known as catastrophic cancellation (Higham, 2002 ) . The resulting numerical noise reduces the accuracy of computed derivatives, and the problem becomes critical when rounding errors are comparable to, or larger than, the displacements being resolved. This limitation is well recognized in precision-sensitive fields such as structural dynamics and geomechanics, where floating-point inaccuracies can distort small-strain calculations (Belytschko et\\xa0al., 2014 ) .\\nTo overcome this limitation, GNSS introduces a novel representation of nodal positions in local coordinate systems that are fixed in both space and time. For each node, the origin is set at its initial position (i.e., its location at time zero), effectively centering all subsequent displacements around zero. By eliminating large absolute position values, this representation mitigates catastrophic cancellation and ensures stable, accurate derivative computations via finite differences. This formulation constitutes a key feature of GNSS, enabling reliable surrogate modeling of structural dynamics where traditional GN formulations fail.\\nThe encoder is responsible for transforming the input graph 𝒢 \\\\mathcal{G} into a latent graph 𝒢 0 \\\\mathcal{G}_{0} , in which the old physical feature vectors are embedded into a latent space. In our implementation, following Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) ’s work, this operation is performed by two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), ϵ Θ v v \\\\epsilon^{v}_{\\\\Theta^{v}} and ϵ Θ e e \\\\epsilon^{e}_{\\\\Theta^{e}} , which embed the feature vectors associated with nodes and edges, respectively. The two MLPs share the same architecture: an input layer with dimensions N x N_{x} for nodes and N r N_{r} for edges, two hidden layers of 64 units each, and an output layer of size 64. The sets of trainable parameters are identified by Θ v \\\\Theta^{v} and Θ e \\\\Theta^{e} , and are optimized during training to learn an effective way to embed physical properties into the latent space. This operation can be represented as shown in Equation 10 :\\nHere, 𝐯 i t \\\\mathbf{v}_{i}^{t} and 𝐞 i \\u200b j t \\\\mathbf{e}_{ij}^{t} represent the node and edge feature vectors in the latent space.\\nFigure 10 shows the encoding procedure for a node and an edge of a sample graph. The result of these operations is a latent graph 𝒢 0 = ( 𝑽 , 𝑬 ) \\\\mathcal{G}^{0}=\\\\left(\\\\bm{V},\\\\bm{E}\\\\right) ; the superscript 0 indicates that this is the initial state representation, prior to performing any message-passing step.\\nThe processor performs the message passing operations, a simplified representation of which is shown in Figure 2 (c).\\nThe processor takes as input the initial graph 𝒢 m \\\\mathcal{G}^{m} , where the index m m denotes the current message-passing step. This index starts from m = 0 m=0 (the encoder output) and is incremented at each iteration until a user-defined number M M of steps is reached. Message passing begins with the message construction phase, illustrated in Figure 5 and described by Equation 11 . In this phase, each edge feature vector is updated by combining its current value with the feature vectors of the two nodes it connects, all evaluated at the current iteration. In our model, this combination is implemented by an MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units each. The input layer has size 3 \\u200b n 3n , since the MLP input is the concatenation of the three feature vectors involved in constructing the message for each edge. The output layer has size n n , corresponding to the latent space dimension, in order to preserve consistency in the feature vector dimensions across the graph entities. This operation can be generalized as:\\nHere, ϕ m \\\\phi^{m} denotes the MLP used at the m m -th message-passing step, and 𝚯 m ϕ \\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}^{\\\\phi}_{m} is the set of trainable parameters associated with it. The operation is repeated for all edges in the graph.\\nThe output of the message construction phase is then used for message aggregation, as illustrated in Figure 6 and described by Equation 12 . For each node i i in the graph, an aggregated message is constructed by element-wise summing the feature vectors of the edges connected to it. This is expressed as:\\nFor each node, the aggregated message is computed and stored together with its previous feature representation in the graph.\\nFinally, the node features are updated, as illustrated in Figure 7 and by Equation 13 . This step involves combining the old node feature vector with the aggregated message to obtain the updated node feature vector. In our model, following the structure from Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) , this operation is performed by an MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units each. The input layer has size 2 \\u200b n 2n (i.e., two times the latent space dimension, since the aggregated message has dimension n n ), and the output layer has dimension n n . This operation is defined as:\\nHere, γ m \\\\gamma^{m} is an operator representing the MLP associated with the current message-passing step, and 𝚯 γ \\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}_{\\\\gamma} represents the set of trainable parameters associated with the MLP. The operation is repeated for all nodes in the graph.\\nIn our model, M M is set to 10, as in Choi & Kumar ( 2024 ) ’s work. Two main aspects cause this hyperparameter to be particularly critical for the model’s performance. The first consideration concerns information propagation: a lower M M may not allow information to reach distant parts of the graph, potentially missing important relational data. Conversely, too many message passing rounds can distort relevant signals, leading to less effective representations. Another important consideration is model complexity. Each message passing step uses its own unique MLPs. This means that with every additional step, new parameters are introduced. As a result, the number of parameters grows linearly with the number of message passing steps, and the computational cost increases as each MLP must be executed in sequence.\\nAt the end of all the prescribed message passing steps, the output of the processor block is an updated graph 𝒢 ′ = 𝒢 M \\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\mathcal{G}^{M} containing the update node feature vector 𝐯 i ′ {\\\\mathbf{v}^{\\\\prime}_{i}} and the updated edge feature vector 𝐞 i \\u200b j ′ {\\\\mathbf{e}^{\\\\prime}_{ij}} .\\nThe decoder extracts the dynamics of all points in the physical system, which correspond one-to-one to the graph nodes, from the information stored in the updated graph 𝒢 ′ \\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\prime} . In other words, the extracted information represents the output of the procedure and corresponds to the prediction for the next time step, t + 1 t+1 , as shown in Equation 14 :\\nHere, 𝐯 i ′ \\\\mathbf{v}^{\\\\prime}_{i} represents the updated node features of node i i , while 𝐲 i ( t + 1 ) \\\\prescript{(t+1)}{}{\\\\mathbf{y}_{i}} represents the predicted dynamics. For structural simulations, the model is trained to predict the acceleration of all points in the physical system. Accordingly, 𝐲 i ( t + 1 ) \\\\prescript{(t+1)}{}{\\\\mathbf{y}_{i}} is a vector of dimension d d ,matching the dimension of the physical space. The operator δ 𝚯 v \\\\delta^{v}_{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}} is the decoder: in our model, this function is an MLP with two hidden layers of 128 units each, with an input layer having the size of the latent space (i.e. n n ), and an output layer having size d d .\\nThe decoding process is illustrated in Figure 8 .\\nThe updater enforces an inertial frame by incorporating the laws of motion through inertial and static priors. The inertial prior assumes that the velocity of each point changes predictably based on its acceleration over a short time interval (Equation 15 ), while the static prior assumes that the position of each point evolves continuously with its current velocity (Equation 16 ). These priors are enforced by hardcoding the updater to calculate the new velocity and position via Euler integration:\\nwhere 𝐲 i ( t + 1 ) \\\\prescript{(t+1)}{}{\\\\mathbf{y}_{i}} is the predicted acceleration of point i i .\\nOur framework relies on two core procedures: training and rollout . The training phase produces a learned model capable of predicting positions, while the rollout phase acts as a solver, generating full trajectories from user-provided input data.\\nThe training procedure is summarized in the pseudo-code shown in Algorithm 1 .\\nAs in traditional ML algorithms, training proceeds over successive epochs. At each epoch, the sampler extracts a batch of data from the training set. Each batch consists of B B samples, randomly selected from all timesteps across all trajectories. Figure 9 illustrates the batching operation for a representative dataset with two trajectories of five timesteps each. In this example, each batch contains B = 2 B=2 random samples across all the available data. In the interest of simplicity, each sample consists of the system configuration at timestep t t together with that at timestep t + 1 t+1 . However, in practical applications, information from several previous timesteps is often included to improve temporal context and prediction accuracy. The configuration at t t is used as input to the model, while the acceleration required to evolve the system from configuration t t to configuration t + 1 t+1 ( 𝐲 ( t + 1 ) \\\\prescript{(t+1)}{}{\\\\mathbf{y}} ) serves as the ground truth (label) for the current training step.\\nFrom the input configuration (positions), velocities are extracted via finite differences. To improve robustness against error accumulation and instabilities during rollout, Gaussian noise is added to all computed velocities in the training samples, following Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) . This regularization strategy encourages the model to generalize beyond the exact training trajectories and mitigates the buildup of prediction errors over time.\\nAfter noise injection, GNSS encodes the system configuration at timestep t t from each sample into a graph, predicts the corresponding acceleration ( 𝐲 \\\\mathbf{y} ), and compares it with the ground truth ( 𝐲 ^ \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}} ). Backpropagation is then used to update the weights of all MLPs and the embedding layer in order to minimize a user-defined loss function. To further improve generalization in long rollouts, we propose a novel loss function, the weighted Mean Squared Error (wMSE) shown in Equation 17 : a modified version of the Mean Squared Error(MSE) that penalizes acceleration predictions with incorrect sign through a scalar weight s s , defined as:\\nHere, the subscript i indicates the i − t \\u200b h i-th node; the final loss is computed as the mean squared value of ε i \\\\varepsilon_{i} over all predictions in the batch.\\nAfter training, predictions are generated in an autoregressive manner: the initial state is encoded as a graph, and GNSS is iteratively applied to predict the full trajectory. The number of iterations N T \\\\rm{N_{T}} is defined by the user to cover the entire physical timeframe of interest, with the understanding that the physical timestep size is fixed and identical to that used to generate the training dataset. The corresponding pseudo-code for the rollout procedure is reported in Algorithm 2 .',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'In Figure 2 , our GNSS is presented. This framework is a modified version of the GNS developed by Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) , specifically adapted for structural simulations. Figure 2 (a) shows the Rollout , namely the procedure used to simulate the trajectory of the system: an initial configuration X 0 X_{0} is provided, then the GNSS is iteratively applied T Δ \\u200b t p \\u200b h \\\\frac{T}{\\\\Delta t_{ph}} times to predict the trajectory from physical time 0 to physical time T T . Δ \\u200b t ph \\\\Delta t_{\\\\mathrm{ph}} is the fixed timestep size adopted in the numerical simulations used to generate all trajectories in the dataset. Figure 2 (b) expands the operation involved at each time step t t , during which the GNSS performs the whole encode-process-decode paradigm to retrieve the updated nodal information (accelerations). Lastly, Figure 2 (c) details the processing phase, i.e., message passing, showing the procedure for a single passing step; as introduced above, message passing is recursively repeated M M times.\\nIn what follows, we detail the GNSS operations shown in Figure 2 (b)–(c).\\nThe pipeline — from graph construction to position update — is described for a single\\nsimulation time step t t ; accordingly, all intermediate quantities are evaluated at t t ,\\nand the output corresponds to the updated state at t + 1 t+1 . Because a single GNSS pass\\nperforms multiple rounds of message passing, we denote the m m -th round by the\\nsuperscript (m) . To avoid clutter, we omit the time index; unless otherwise stated,\\nall expressions are understood at time t t .\\nThe pre-processing phase is responsible for representing the information stored in the initial configuration of the system into a graph structure ready to be processed by the GN.\\nThe representation of the system naturally follows from the choice of a graph-based model. The continuous structure is discretized into a set of points , each capturing the local physical properties of its neighborhood, while the interactions among these points are expressed as relationships . Throughout the following description, we will denote a point in the discretized structure as x x , and its associated relationship as r i \\u200b j r_{ij} , representing the underlying physical properties. In contrast, the terms node v i v_{i} and edge e i \\u200b j e_{ij} will refer to the corresponding latent features, i.e., the latent graph representation used within the model.\\nRegarding the relationship between those points, the primary idea behind the graph construction proposed by Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) is that, typically, entities in physical systems are influenced by their neighbors. This natural behavior is reflected in the graph structure by establishing edges only between nodes that are sufficiently close. In practice, this is achieved by defining a connectivity radius that sets the maximum allowable distance for two nodes to be connected, as shown in Figure 3 .\\nOnce the graph’s topology is defined, each node i i of the graph is associated with a feature vector storing physical information. Following the implementation proposed by Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) , the point feature vector stores information about the velocity context and the type of particle related to the node. As demonstrated by Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) , including not only the current velocity of a point, but also the velocities from previous timesteps, greatly improves the performance of the model. This information is stored in a tensor as shown in Equation 6 :\\nHere, t t is the current timestep, and 𝐩 ˙ i ( t ) \\\\prescript{(t)}{}{\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{p}}}_{i} is the velocity of point i i at time t t , d d is the dimension of the space, and n n is the number of previous velocities considered (in addition to the current one). This is a hyperparameter, and is usually set to n = 4 n=4 as suggested by Choi & Kumar ( 2024 ) . The velocities are calculated via finite differences as shown in Equation 7 :\\nwhere 𝐩 i ( t ) \\\\prescript{(t)}{}{{\\\\mathbf{p}}}_{i} is the position of point i i at time t t and Δ \\u200b t \\\\Delta t is the timestep size. The timestep size used in the algorithm is set to 1, as non-dimensional time quantities are preferred during prediction. This unit timestep size corresponds to a physical timestep Δ \\u200b t p \\u200b h \\\\Delta t_{ph} implicitly defined by the one used in the training dataset. Consequently, the timestep size adopted in the numerical simulations must remain fixed and identical across all trajectories in the dataset.\\nThe framework is designed to account for different types of particles. This information is required by the model to correctly handle entities playing different roles in the simulation, and is stored in a vector 𝐟 \\\\mathbf{f} . This vector has 16 components and is created through an embedding layer.\\nIn our model, we exploit this structure to inform the prediction mechanism about the constraint of the structural simulation. Thanks to this choice, we can simply assign arbitrary IDs to different types of constraints, and the model will optimize the weights of the embedding layer (i.e., the 16 components of 𝐟 \\\\mathbf{f} ) to best represent the different entities according to their behavior. For example, we can assign an ID to the free portion (nodes) of the structure, another ID to nodes where a prescribed motion is applied, and another ID to the region of application of BCs. This choice allows us to simplify the feature vector proposed by Choi & Kumar ( 2024 ) by eliminating the information about the distance from the boundaries that was given for each node. Additionally, this allows us to model different types of boundaries by assigning different IDs to them (clamp, pin, etc.).\\nAll the properties listed above are included in a point state vector, as shown in Equation 8 :\\nHere, 𝐩 ˙ i ≤ t \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{p}}_{i}^{\\\\leq t} is the flattened vector of velocities history. For a representative 2D case, considering the current velocity and 4 additional velocities and the previous timesteps, the point feature vector is composed of 26 elements: 5 components for velocity along direction x x , 5 for velocity along direction y y , and 16 for the type embedding.\\nMoreover, the interaction between connected points i i and j j is represented by their distance in the physical space and their displacement in the current timestep, both normalized by the connectivity radius R R , as shown in Equation 9 :\\nThe distance provides information about the level of interaction between the two points, while the displacement gives a direction to the relationship.\\nTypically, GNs represent displacements in an absolute coordinate system shared by the entire physical system (Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Choi & Kumar, 2024 ) . While this approach is well-suited to domains commonly simulated with GNs, such as granular flow and fluid dynamics, it can be problematic in structural mechanics. In structural simulations, load-induced displacements are often several orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the system. This scale mismatch can cause numerical issues when derivatives (e.g., velocities) are computed via finite differences. In particular, subtracting two large, nearly equal floating-point numbers (absolute positions at successive timesteps) may lead to a loss of significant digits, a phenomenon known as catastrophic cancellation (Higham, 2002 ) . The resulting numerical noise reduces the accuracy of computed derivatives, and the problem becomes critical when rounding errors are comparable to, or larger than, the displacements being resolved. This limitation is well recognized in precision-sensitive fields such as structural dynamics and geomechanics, where floating-point inaccuracies can distort small-strain calculations (Belytschko et\\xa0al., 2014 ) .\\nTo overcome this limitation, GNSS introduces a novel representation of nodal positions in local coordinate systems that are fixed in both space and time. For each node, the origin is set at its initial position (i.e., its location at time zero), effectively centering all subsequent displacements around zero. By eliminating large absolute position values, this representation mitigates catastrophic cancellation and ensures stable, accurate derivative computations via finite differences. This formulation constitutes a key feature of GNSS, enabling reliable surrogate modeling of structural dynamics where traditional GN formulations fail.\\nThe encoder is responsible for transforming the input graph 𝒢 \\\\mathcal{G} into a latent graph 𝒢 0 \\\\mathcal{G}_{0} , in which the old physical feature vectors are embedded into a latent space. In our implementation, following Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) ’s work, this operation is performed by two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), ϵ Θ v v \\\\epsilon^{v}_{\\\\Theta^{v}} and ϵ Θ e e \\\\epsilon^{e}_{\\\\Theta^{e}} , which embed the feature vectors associated with nodes and edges, respectively. The two MLPs share the same architecture: an input layer with dimensions N x N_{x} for nodes and N r N_{r} for edges, two hidden layers of 64 units each, and an output layer of size 64. The sets of trainable parameters are identified by Θ v \\\\Theta^{v} and Θ e \\\\Theta^{e} , and are optimized during training to learn an effective way to embed physical properties into the latent space. This operation can be represented as shown in Equation 10 :\\nHere, 𝐯 i t \\\\mathbf{v}_{i}^{t} and 𝐞 i \\u200b j t \\\\mathbf{e}_{ij}^{t} represent the node and edge feature vectors in the latent space.\\nFigure 10 shows the encoding procedure for a node and an edge of a sample graph. The result of these operations is a latent graph 𝒢 0 = ( 𝑽 , 𝑬 ) \\\\mathcal{G}^{0}=\\\\left(\\\\bm{V},\\\\bm{E}\\\\right) ; the superscript 0 indicates that this is the initial state representation, prior to performing any message-passing step.\\nThe processor performs the message passing operations, a simplified representation of which is shown in Figure 2 (c).\\nThe processor takes as input the initial graph 𝒢 m \\\\mathcal{G}^{m} , where the index m m denotes the current message-passing step. This index starts from m = 0 m=0 (the encoder output) and is incremented at each iteration until a user-defined number M M of steps is reached. Message passing begins with the message construction phase, illustrated in Figure 5 and described by Equation 11 . In this phase, each edge feature vector is updated by combining its current value with the feature vectors of the two nodes it connects, all evaluated at the current iteration. In our model, this combination is implemented by an MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units each. The input layer has size 3 \\u200b n 3n , since the MLP input is the concatenation of the three feature vectors involved in constructing the message for each edge. The output layer has size n n , corresponding to the latent space dimension, in order to preserve consistency in the feature vector dimensions across the graph entities. This operation can be generalized as:\\nHere, ϕ m \\\\phi^{m} denotes the MLP used at the m m -th message-passing step, and 𝚯 m ϕ \\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}^{\\\\phi}_{m} is the set of trainable parameters associated with it. The operation is repeated for all edges in the graph.\\nThe output of the message construction phase is then used for message aggregation, as illustrated in Figure 6 and described by Equation 12 . For each node i i in the graph, an aggregated message is constructed by element-wise summing the feature vectors of the edges connected to it. This is expressed as:\\nFor each node, the aggregated message is computed and stored together with its previous feature representation in the graph.\\nFinally, the node features are updated, as illustrated in Figure 7 and by Equation 13 . This step involves combining the old node feature vector with the aggregated message to obtain the updated node feature vector. In our model, following the structure from Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) , this operation is performed by an MLP with two hidden layers of 64 units each. The input layer has size 2 \\u200b n 2n (i.e., two times the latent space dimension, since the aggregated message has dimension n n ), and the output layer has dimension n n . This operation is defined as:\\nHere, γ m \\\\gamma^{m} is an operator representing the MLP associated with the current message-passing step, and 𝚯 γ \\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}_{\\\\gamma} represents the set of trainable parameters associated with the MLP. The operation is repeated for all nodes in the graph.\\nIn our model, M M is set to 10, as in Choi & Kumar ( 2024 ) ’s work. Two main aspects cause this hyperparameter to be particularly critical for the model’s performance. The first consideration concerns information propagation: a lower M M may not allow information to reach distant parts of the graph, potentially missing important relational data. Conversely, too many message passing rounds can distort relevant signals, leading to less effective representations. Another important consideration is model complexity. Each message passing step uses its own unique MLPs. This means that with every additional step, new parameters are introduced. As a result, the number of parameters grows linearly with the number of message passing steps, and the computational cost increases as each MLP must be executed in sequence.\\nAt the end of all the prescribed message passing steps, the output of the processor block is an updated graph 𝒢 ′ = 𝒢 M \\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\mathcal{G}^{M} containing the update node feature vector 𝐯 i ′ {\\\\mathbf{v}^{\\\\prime}_{i}} and the updated edge feature vector 𝐞 i \\u200b j ′ {\\\\mathbf{e}^{\\\\prime}_{ij}} .\\nThe decoder extracts the dynamics of all points in the physical system, which correspond one-to-one to the graph nodes, from the information stored in the updated graph 𝒢 ′ \\\\mathcal{G}^{\\\\prime} . In other words, the extracted information represents the output of the procedure and corresponds to the prediction for the next time step, t + 1 t+1 , as shown in Equation 14 :\\nHere, 𝐯 i ′ \\\\mathbf{v}^{\\\\prime}_{i} represents the updated node features of node i i , while 𝐲 i ( t + 1 ) \\\\prescript{(t+1)}{}{\\\\mathbf{y}_{i}} represents the predicted dynamics. For structural simulations, the model is trained to predict the acceleration of all points in the physical system. Accordingly, 𝐲 i ( t + 1 ) \\\\prescript{(t+1)}{}{\\\\mathbf{y}_{i}} is a vector of dimension d d ,matching the dimension of the physical space. The operator δ 𝚯 v \\\\delta^{v}_{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Theta}} is the decoder: in our model, this function is an MLP with two hidden layers of 128 units each, with an input layer having the size of the latent space (i.e. n n ), and an output layer having size d d .\\nThe decoding process is illustrated in Figure 8 .\\nThe updater enforces an inertial frame by incorporating the laws of motion through inertial and static priors. The inertial prior assumes that the velocity of each point changes predictably based on its acceleration over a short time interval (Equation 15 ), while the static prior assumes that the position of each point evolves continuously with its current velocity (Equation 16 ). These priors are enforced by hardcoding the updater to calculate the new velocity and position via Euler integration:\\nwhere 𝐲 i ( t + 1 ) \\\\prescript{(t+1)}{}{\\\\mathbf{y}_{i}} is the predicted acceleration of point i i .\\nOur framework relies on two core procedures: training and rollout . The training phase produces a learned model capable of predicting positions, while the rollout phase acts as a solver, generating full trajectories from user-provided input data.\\nThe training procedure is summarized in the pseudo-code shown in Algorithm 1 .\\nAs in traditional ML algorithms, training proceeds over successive epochs. At each epoch, the sampler extracts a batch of data from the training set. Each batch consists of B B samples, randomly selected from all timesteps across all trajectories. Figure 9 illustrates the batching operation for a representative dataset with two trajectories of five timesteps each. In this example, each batch contains B = 2 B=2 random samples across all the available data. In the interest of simplicity, each sample consists of the system configuration at timestep t t together with that at timestep t + 1 t+1 . However, in practical applications, information from several previous timesteps is often included to improve temporal context and prediction accuracy. The configuration at t t is used as input to the model, while the acceleration required to evolve the system from configuration t t to configuration t + 1 t+1 ( 𝐲 ( t + 1 ) \\\\prescript{(t+1)}{}{\\\\mathbf{y}} ) serves as the ground truth (label) for the current training step.\\nFrom the input configuration (positions), velocities are extracted via finite differences. To improve robustness against error accumulation and instabilities during rollout, Gaussian noise is added to all computed velocities in the training samples, following Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al. ( 2020 ) . This regularization strategy encourages the model to generalize beyond the exact training trajectories and mitigates the buildup of prediction errors over time.\\nAfter noise injection, GNSS encodes the system configuration at timestep t t from each sample into a graph, predicts the corresponding acceleration ( 𝐲 \\\\mathbf{y} ), and compares it with the ground truth ( 𝐲 ^ \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}} ). Backpropagation is then used to update the weights of all MLPs and the embedding layer in order to minimize a user-defined loss function. To further improve generalization in long rollouts, we propose a novel loss function, the weighted Mean Squared Error (wMSE) shown in Equation 17 : a modified version of the Mean Squared Error(MSE) that penalizes acceleration predictions with incorrect sign through a scalar weight s s , defined as:\\nHere, the subscript i indicates the i − t \\u200b h i-th node; the final loss is computed as the mean squared value of ε i \\\\varepsilon_{i} over all predictions in the batch.\\nAfter training, predictions are generated in an autoregressive manner: the initial state is encoded as a graph, and GNSS is iteratively applied to predict the full trajectory. The number of iterations N T \\\\rm{N_{T}} is defined by the user to cover the entire physical timeframe of interest, with the understanding that the physical timestep size is fixed and identical to that used to generate the training dataset. The corresponding pseudo-code for the rollout procedure is reported in Algorithm 2 .',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'To evaluate the capabilities of GNSS, we generated a validated numerical dataset using Abaqus for a fully clamped beam of length 320\\u2009mm. The beam was excited through a transverse prescribed motion applied to an interior node. The displacement–time history at the input node consists of a single sine-wave cycle at 50 \\u200b kHz 50\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kHz} , modulated by a Hanning window. Table 1 summarizes the simulation parameters used to create the dataset.\\nSix distinct trajectories were generated by varying the location of the prescribed motion, as illustrated in Figure 10 . Only the interior nodes highlighted in the figure were included, while regions near the boundaries were excluded to avoid wave reflections that could interfere with the signal. This choice allows the analysis to focus on pure wave propagation and simplifies the initial case study.Four trajectories were used for training, one for validation, and one was reserved exclusively for testing.\\nA sensitivity analysis was conducted to obtain a coarse tuning of the model hyperparameters.The results are shown in Figure 11 .\\nRed bars correspond to the baseline hyperparameters, which are kept fixed across all experiments except for the one under analysis. Each gray bar therefore represents the outcome of a training and rollout in which a single hyperparameter is varied from its baseline value, while all others remain at their baseline configuration. For example, in panel (a), the bar associated with r / Δ = 7 r/\\\\Delta=7 corresponds to a model trained with baseline values for all other hyperparameters, but with the connectivity radius set to 7.\\nThe bar height indicates the rollout MSE loss, defined as the mean Euclidean distance between predicted and ground-truth nodal positions, averaged over all timesteps of the rollout and across all trajectories in the dataset. Error bars denote the corresponding standard deviations.\\nPanel (a) reports the performance as a function of the connectivity radius. Prior studies suggest that an effective trade-off for modeling fluid and granular systems is to maintain approximately 15–20 edges per node (Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Choi & Kumar, 2024 ) . In structural problems, however, a physically meaningful scale can be identified, directly tied to the choice of the connectivity radius. In particular, the wavelength λ \\\\lambda of bending waves in beams can be estimated using the Euler–Bernoulli beam dispersion relation:\\nwhere E E is the Young’s modulus, I I the second moment of area, ρ \\\\rho the material density, A A the cross-sectional area, and f f the wave frequency. For the physical properties of the beam considered here, this yields a wavelength of approximately λ ≈ 13.4 \\u200b mm \\\\lambda\\\\approx 13.4\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mm} . Given our mesh resolution of 0.8 \\u200b mm 0.8\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mm} per node, each wavelength spans approximately 16–17 nodes, and half of this number is sufficient to capture a representative portion of the wave. This is confirmed by the sensitivity analysis, which shows the best performance for a connectivity radius including 7–10 neighboring nodes. Such a choice ensures that local interactions are sufficiently informed by the underlying physics, a key factor for accurately modeling wave propagation dynamics.\\nPanel (b) shows the performance with respect to the penalty term s s introduced in the proposed loss function. The rollout MSE remains stable for small values of s s , with the best performance obtained for s = 1.5 s=1.5 .\\nPanel (c) reports the rollout MSE as a function of the connectivity radius. Although the average MSE is lower with 13 message passing steps than with 10, the computational cost and the variability of the error across different trajectories are significantly higher in the former case. Moreover, while 7 message passing steps yield the best performance, the choice of 10 message passing steps — motivated by previous studies (Sanchez-Gonzalez et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Choi & Kumar, 2024 ) — is confirmed as a reliable default setting, which we adopt as the standard in this work.\\nFinally, panel (d) illustrates the effect of the Gaussian noise standard deviation. The most effective setting is found to be around 9-10% of the maximum displacement amplitude. Larger noise levels prevent the model from converging, whereas smaller levels do not provide sufficient robustness for long rollouts.\\nThe sensitivity analysis results show that the identified baseline values provide sufficiently accurate performance in terms of rollout MSE. Consequently, these values were adopted as the default configuration and used to train the GNSS model in the subsequent experiments.\\nTwo models, namely, GNSS and a traditional GNS, were trained using the baseline hyperparameters identified through the sensitivity analysis. The training performance is reported in Figure 12 . GNSS exhibited a promising decreasing trend during the early epochs, followed by a plateau in the later stages of training. The validation loss confirmed that no overfitting occurred. In contrast, the GNS loss decreased during the first few epochs but subsequently increased, converging to a value higher than the initial one. This behavior suggests that GNS is not effectively learning to capture the underlying physical phenomena, despite the absence of overfitting.\\nWe attribute the difference in performance primarily to the nature of the input information: while GNS operates on variables expressed in absolute coordinates, GNSS encodes the same information in relative coordinates.\\nThe trained models were then evaluated on unseen trajectories, characterized by the same structure and excitation type but applied at different excitation points. The rollout results for both models are presented in Figure 13 .\\nPanel (a) presents five rollout snapshots at representative timesteps for the ground truth (a1), GNSS (a2), and GNS (a3). Transverse displacements are on the order of μ \\u200b m \\\\mu\\\\mathrm{m} , but are visually magnified in the figure for clarity. The colorbar indicates the displacement magnitude, with its range defined by the minimum and maximum values of the ground truth in Figure 13 (a1).\\nQualitatively, the GNSS predictions closely follow the ground truth across all timesteps. In contrast, the GNS model fails to reproduce the physical response. For visualization purposes, the GNS results were scaled by a factor of 0.03 to enable a qualitative comparison of the deformation shapes. The colorbar further indicates that most predicted displacements lie far outside the physical range, underscoring the inability of the GNS model to produce physically consistent results.\\nPanel (b) provides a quantitative comparison of the displacement–time histories for three representative nodes: node 5 near the left end (b1), node 92 near the midpoint (b2), and node 180 near the right end (b3). Each plot reports the ground truth together with the GNSS and the GNS prediction. A separate vertical axis is used for the GNS curves to enable meaningful visual comparison. The GNSS model shows high accuracy in predicting the trajectory of all considered nodes. In contrast, GNS not only fails to capture the correct waveform, but also diverges to displacement values several orders of magnitude larger than the ground truth.\\nFigure 14 summarizes the spatial and temporal distributions of the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between the predicted and reference values. Panel (a) divides the beam into five equal segments and, for each segment, shows the kernel density of the RMSE averaged over t ∈ [ 30 , 100 ] \\u200b μ \\u200b s t\\\\in[30,100]\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\text{s} to suppress initial-transient bias. Sub-panel (a4) corresponds to the segment containing the node where the prescribed displacement is applied; this actuated node is excluded from the statistics. The error peaks in the input segment and decreases with distance from it, which is consistent with the presence of stronger local gradients and earlier motion near the excitation. Regions farther from the input remain quiescent for longer periods and therefore accumulate less error during the rollout. Panel (b) characterizes error growth over time by plotting the RMSE distributions aggregated from t = 0 t=0 up to t = t i t=t_{i} for t i ∈ { 1 , 50 , 99 } \\u200b μ \\u200b s t_{i}\\\\in\\\\{1,50,99\\\\}\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\text{s} . Both models accumulate error as the rollout progresses; however, GNSS exhibits only a modest shift toward higher RMSE values and remains concentrated at much lower error levels, whereas GNS shifts markedly and develops heavy tails at larger RMSE. Across both panels, GNSS consistently maintains substantially lower errors than the standard GNS.\\nThe results demonstrate that the standard approach based on absolute positions is inadequate for accurately modeling displacement, velocity, or acceleration fields when displacements are several orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic structural dimensions. By contrast, GNSS, through its relative coordinate formulation, successfully overcomes this limitation and achieves physically consistent predictions.\\nOn our dataset, GNSS attains an average speed-up of about 5 × 5\\\\times over FEM. According to the graph construction method adopted in this work, where two nodes are connected if their distance is less than or equal to a maximum allowable distance (the connectivity radius R R ), the expected node degree can be computed as shown in Equation 19 (Penrose, 2003 ) :\\nHere, κ d \\\\kappa_{d} is the volume of a unit ball in the d d -dimensional space ( κ 1 = 2 , κ 2 = π , κ 3 = 4 3 \\u200b π \\\\kappa_{1}=2,\\\\,\\\\kappa_{2}=\\\\pi,\\\\,\\\\kappa_{3}=\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi ). Given fixed node intensity λ \\\\lambda (analogous to mesh density) and fixed connectivity radius R R , the expected value of the degree of the node is bounded, hence the number of edges grows linearly with the total number of nodes, E = Θ \\u200b ( N ) E=\\\\Theta(N) . A message-passing layer with sparse edgewise aggregation therefore costs O \\u200b ( E + N ) = O \\u200b ( N ) O(E+N)=O(N) ; stacking a fixed number of layers keeps one GNSS rollout step near-linear in N N (up to feature-width constants).\\nIn contrast, explicit solvers for structural dynamics problems perform time integration using an explicit central-difference scheme with a lumped mass matrix, and the per-increment computational cost scales approximately linearly with the number of elements or nodes (Das, 2006 ) . However, the stable time increment in explicit integration is limited by a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which ensures that numerical information does not propagate faster than the physical wave speed within an element. This stability bound scales with the smallest element size, as shown in Equation 20 :\\nwhere h min h_{\\\\min} is the minimum characteristic element length and c c is the relevant wave propagation speed in the material (Das, 2006 ) . As indicated by Equation 20 , refining a fixed spatial domain (i.e., decreasing element size h h ) simultaneously increases the number of nodes N ∼ h − d N\\\\sim h^{-d} and decreases the stable time increment Δ \\u200b t stable ∼ h \\\\Delta t_{\\\\mathrm{stable}}\\\\sim h . Over a fixed physical duration τ \\\\tau , the number of required time steps then scales as 1 / Δ \\u200b t stable ∼ h − 1 1/\\\\Delta t_{\\\\mathrm{stable}}\\\\sim h^{-1} . Combining the per-step computational cost O \\u200b ( N ) O(N) with O \\u200b ( 1 / Δ \\u200b t stable ) O(1/\\\\Delta t_{\\\\mathrm{stable}}) steps yields a total explicit runtime of O \\u200b ( N 1 + 1 / d ) O\\\\!\\\\big(N^{1+1/d}\\\\big) , representing superlinear growth imposed by the stability constraint.\\nIn contrast, GNSS advances the solution through feed-forward message passing at the prescribed time step Δ \\u200b t ph \\\\Delta t_{\\\\mathrm{ph}} of the training dataset, which remains fixed across trajectories. There is no CFL-type restriction, so the temporal resolution is arbitrarily selected and imposed during training rather than being dictated by numerical stability. The per-step computational cost remains approximately linear in N N , making the observed 5 × 5\\\\times speed-up in our simple test case a conservative estimate for higher-resolution problems.',\n",

While vanilla RNNs have been empirically shown to retain roughly one real value of information per hidden unit, with the effective task-specific capacity linearly bounded by the number of model parameters [Collins et\\xa0al., 2017 ] , similar limitations extend to gated architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997 , Cho et\\xa0al., 2014 ] , despite their use of gating and explicit memory cells [Collins et\\xa0al., 2017 ] .\\nThis means that more complex sequences may exceed what the hidden state can encode, forcing the model to compress or forget.\\nThe introduction of the Transformer [Vaswani et\\xa0al., 2017 ] appeared to obviate explicit recurrence by bypassing the hidden-state bottleneck. However, recent work shows that recurrent inductive bias remains highly competitive and provides representational advantages not matched by Transformers [Gu and Dao, 2023 , Orvieto et\\xa0al., 2023 , Bhattamishra et\\xa0al., 2024 , Beck et\\xa0al., 2024 ] .\\nAnother challenge in training RNNs is the vanishing and exploding gradient problem [Bengio et\\xa0al., 1994 , Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997 ] , which arises from repeated multiplication through the recurrent Jacobian. Among various strategies to address this [Mikolov, 2012 , Pascanu et\\xa0al., 2013 , Le et\\xa0al., 2015 ] , unitary and orthogonal RNNs [Arjovsky et\\xa0al., 2016 , Jing et\\xa0al., 2019 , Helfrich et\\xa0al., 2018 , Kiani et\\xa0al., 2022 ] constrain the recurrent weights to be norm-preserving, allowing gradients to remain stable across timesteps. These models perform well on synthetic tasks, but their results on broader benchmarks vary.\\nWith the advancement of quantum computing [Arute et\\xa0al., 2019 , Acharya et\\xa0al., 2024 , Reichardt et\\xa0al., 2024 , DeCross et\\xa0al., 2025 ] , parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), which are a core component of variational hybrid quantum-classical models, have concurrently emerged as an alternative mechanism for function approximation [Benedetti et\\xa0al., 2019 , Du et\\xa0al., 2019 , Bondesan and Welling, 2020 , Pérez-Salinas et\\xa0al., 2021 , Schuld et\\xa0al., 2021 , Yu et\\xa0al., 2024b ] . PQCs implement unitary transformations by construction, which naturally preserve norms (§ 3.1 ). Acting on n n qubits, they enable expressive transformations over quantum states in an exponentially large Hilbert space ℂ 2 n \\\\mathbb{C}^{2^{n}} . Although such spaces are classically intractable beyond moderate n n , they can be manipulated with only n n qubits on quantum hardware.\\nIn this work, we present a hybrid quantum–classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) architecture grounded in quantum operations, in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a PQC. The hidden state is the quantum state of the PQC, residing in an exponentially large Hilbert space. A classical feedforward network parametrizes and steers the quantum computation, introducing nonlinearity through mid-circuit readouts, which are realized in simulation as a limiting case via projective measurements. This avoids emulating nonlinearity through linear quantum dynamics, leaving the PQC strictly for coherent unitary evolution.\\nFig. 2 illustrates both the PQC (with four qubits shown for illustration) and the unrolled QRNN:\\nAt each timestep t t , the input is mapped to a classical embedding 𝐱 t \\\\mathbf{x}_{t} via a learnable embedding layer.\\nA classical feedforward network ℱ \\\\mathcal{F} takes as input the concatenation of the readout vector 𝐳 t − 1 \\\\mathbf{z}_{t-1} (outputs from all measurements at timestep t − 1 t-1 ) and the current input 𝐱 t \\\\mathbf{x}_{t} . It outputs the PQC parameters 𝜽 t \\\\bm{\\\\theta}_{t} which configure the PQC with a fixed gate layout (Fig. 1(a) ), denoted U \\u200b ( 𝜽 t ) U(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}_{t}) , applied at timestep t t (Fig. 1(c) ).\\nThe PQC applies the parametrized unitary gates to evolve the quantum state, yielding the updated state. Residing in an exponentially large Hilbert space, this state persists across timesteps and provides the model’s core recurrent memory.\\nThe mid-circuit readout 𝐳 t \\\\mathbf{z}_{t} (or the final readout at the end of the sequence) is a classical feature vector obtained from the quantum state via measurements and is used: (i) as recurrent feedback 𝐳 t − 1 \\\\mathbf{z}_{t-1} at timestep t t , and (ii) as the input to task-specific classical layers.\\nWe develop the models on GPUs, allowing us to simulate and train quantum recurrence via classical backpropagation, with the expectation that such models will become classically unsimulatable as the number of qubits increases. To our knowledge, this is the first model grounded in quantum operations (RNN or otherwise) demonstrated in classical simulation with up to 14 qubits across six realistic sequence-modeling tasks, achieving competitive performance with LSTM and the scaled Cayley orthogonal scoRNN designed for norm preservation [Helfrich et\\xa0al., 2018 ] . Experiments also show that classical nonlinear control and feedback are effective, with the nonlinear variants outperforming their linear counterparts, and that the unitary quantum recurrent core maintains more stable gradients than LSTMs (§ 4.6 ).\\nThe QRNN is motivated in part by the memory and gradient problems of RNNs, but its main aim is to explore a hybrid quantum–classical recurrent model in an idealized proof of principle that allows us to study its computational behavior under best-case conditions across a broad class of sequence learning tasks. The PQC [Sim et\\xa0al., 2019 ] uses only one- and two-qubit gates without nonstandard operations, and the overall architecture provides a hardware-aware base case and a plausible path toward future hardware implementations.\\nAnother way to view the QRNN is via fast and slow weights in RNNs, which function as different types of memory across multiple timescales [Schmidhuber, 1992 , Ba et\\xa0al., 2016 ] . The PQC parameters serve as the short-term memory, analogous to the hidden activities of classical RNNs, and are controlled and reconfigured at each timestep by a classical feedforward network whose slow weights encode the long-term memory. The quantum state, updated via unitary transformations, evolves on a faster timescale than the slow weights, persists across timesteps, and acts as a third, higher-capacity memory in the Hilbert space, retaining information that influences subsequent computation [Hinton and Plaut, 1987 , Schmidhuber, 1993 ] .',\n",

The aim here is not to prescribe a hardware roadmap but to analyze a hardware-realistic base case under idealized classical simulation to study the empirical properties of the architecture, where we model mid-circuit observations via projective measurements as a limiting case.\\nAs more efficient and scalable toolchains become available (e.g., future multi-GPU toolkits based on cuQuantum [Bayraktar et\\xa0al., 2023 ] ), we anticipate more faithful simulations via ancilla-mediated schemes in which auxiliary qubits are entangled with the main circuit, measured, and reset as needed while the recurrent memory remains coherent. This aligns with mid-circuit measure-and-reset operations already supported on several platforms [DeCross et\\xa0al., 2022 , Lis et\\xa0al., 2023 , Norcia et\\xa0al., 2023 ] , although hardware implementations for large-scale sequence modeling would require fault-tolerant devices capable of sustaining long coherent recurrences and real-time classical control.\\nThis paper bridges quantum operations and recurrent learning by introducing a new hybrid QRNN whose recurrent core is implemented as a PQC steered by a classical controller. The unitary dynamics preserve norms, promoting stable gradient propagation; the controller supplies the nonlinearity and task adaptivity needed for expressiveness; and mid-circuit measurements enable per-timestep readouts and classical feedback.

It is evident that the model handles compound verb constructions and semantic expansion , in sentences like “Diese Band bereitet sich auf einen Auftritt vor Publikum in einer Kirche vor” (Fig. 4(a) ) and “Zwei grün gekleidete Männer bereiten in einem Restaurant Essen zu” (Fig. 4(b) ), where German separable verbs— “bereitet … vor” and “bereiten … zu” —are correctly reconstructed into the English verb phrases “is preparing to perform” and “preparing” , respectively. The soft attention allowed the model to attend across non-contiguous source tokens, enabling reassembly of verb phrases. Additionally, lexical expansions such as “Publikum” → \\\\rightarrow “a crowd of people” (Fig. 4(a) ) and “gekleidete Männer” → \\\\rightarrow “men in green outfits” (Fig. 4(b) ) demonstrate contextually appropriate semantic elaboration beyond literal translation.\\nThe model also displays syntactic reordering and clause realignment , necessitated by divergences between German and English word order. This is shown in both “Diese Band … vor Publikum … vor” and (Fig. 4(a) ) “Menschen, die vor einem großen Gebäude im Kreis sitzen” (Fig. 4(c) ). In the former, German’s verb-final structure is reorganized into a mid-sentence English verb phrase, while handling nested prepositional phrases. In the latter, the relative clause “die … sitzen” is compressed into the participial phrase “sitting” , dropping auxiliaries and pronouns to better fit English syntactic norms. Similarly, the location and positional phrases “im Kreis” and “vor einem großen Gebäude” are reordered into “in a circle in front of a large building”\\nLastly, for multi-clause coordination , tense adaptation , and long-range dependency tracking , as seen in “Acht Männer spielen auf der Bühne, während ein Gitarrist im Scheinwerferlicht spielt” (Fig. 4(d) ).

The hidden state is the quantum state of an nn-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially large Hilbert space ℂ2n\\\\mathbb{C}^{2^{n}}. The PQC is unitary by construction, making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints. At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine translation.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Text-to-SQL, the task of automatically translating natural language questions into executable SQL queries, is a key technique for lowering the barrier to database access (Liu et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . By enabling non-technical users to query structured data in natural language, it has found wide applications in business intelligence, data analytics, and interactive question answering (Hong et\\xa0al., 2025 ) .\\nExisting approaches to Text-to-SQL generally fall into three paradigms: (i) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of domain-specific open-source models (Li et\\xa0al., 2025b ; 2024b ) ; (ii) prompting closed-source large language models (LLMs) with advanced reasoning strategies such as chain-of-thought (Li et\\xa0al., 2025a ; Zhai et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Pourreza et\\xa0al., 2024 ) ; and (iii) Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods that optimize model reasoning with algorithms such as PPO and GRPO (Pourreza et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Ma et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Yao et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Dai et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . In particular, RL methods leverage final SQL execution results as reward signals for policy optimization. However, current practices treat execution feedback merely as scalar rewards, wasting rich tool information and leaving static LLMs unable to adapt their reasoning dynamically.\\nRecently, Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (MTIR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By interleaving model reasoning with external tools—such as search engines, Python interpreters, and SQL executors—MTIR enables LLMs to overcome intrinsic limitations in computation, retrieval, and structured manipulation. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of RL-based optimization in tool use: Search-R1 (Jin et\\xa0al., 2025 ) explores dynamic tool invocation for question answering, while ToRL (Li et\\xa0al., 2025c ) and Effective CIR (Bai et\\xa0al., 2025 ) design tailored RL recipes for mathematical reasoning. More recently, the ReEx-SQL (Dai et\\xa0al., 2025 ) framework extends TIR to Text-to-SQL, providing early evidence of its potential in structured query tasks.\\nDespite this progress, three fundamental challenges remain. On the tool side , SQL-oriented MTIR remains underexplored; existing efforts often rely on ad-hoc token mechanisms for tool invocation, limiting interoperability, extensibility, and compatibility with diverse database operations (Jin et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Dai et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . On the RL side , dominant methods such as GRPO suffer from reward collapse and difficulty in modeling long-horizon dependencies, leading to instability in multi-turn tool interaction. On the framework side , current Text-to-SQL studies adopt heterogeneous, non-standardized implementations that lack modularity and generality (Dai et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Ma et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Yao et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Gajjar et\\xa0al., 2025 ) .\\nTo address these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL , a reinforcement learning framework for Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning in Text-to-SQL (Figure 1 ). MTIR-SQL extends GRPO to handle complex multi-turn interactions and introduces two key modifications: (i) a trajectory filtering mechanism to discard invalid rollouts and (ii) the removal of KL regularization to mitigate distributional collapse during training. Built on top of RL-Factory (Chai et\\xa0al., 2025 ) with standardized MCP-compatible tool invocation, our framework ensures extensibility and interoperability.\\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\\nMTIR-SQL Framework. We introduce a novel RL framework for Text-to-SQL that enables LLMs to reason interactively and directly optimize via SQL execution feedback. It incorporates retrieval-based token masking for stable training and supports multi-turn iterative reasoning and execution verification.\\nGRPO Extensions. We extend GRPO with SQL execution rollout expansion and trajectory filtering to stabilize training in multi-turn tool-use scenarios, effectively mitigating reward collapse.\\nStrong Empirical Results. On the BIRD dataset, MTIR-SQL trained on Qwen-3-4B achieves a 16% absolute improvement over baselines, matching the performance of recent 7B-coder models. It attains competitive execution accuracy, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.',\n",

Early work focused on single-turn tool invocation through supervised fine-tuning approaches, demonstrating effectiveness across domains, including mathematical reasoning, code generation (Mai et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , and search integration (Jin et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . Multi-turn TIR enables iterative reasoning through sequential tool interactions, where models repeatedly generate tool calls, execute it, and refine based on results (Mai et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Shang et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Fu et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Yue et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Lin et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Wang et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Zeng et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Zhao et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . However, training stability remains a critical challenge due to distribution drift from external tool outputs and error accumulation across reasoning rounds, often leading to training instability and entropy collapse.

We train and evaluate our model on two Text-to-SQL benchmarks, SPIDER (Yu et\\xa0al., 2019 ) and BIRD (Li et\\xa0al., 2023 ) , which assess different aspects of the task. SPIDER is a large-scale, cross-domain benchmark focused on SQL complexity, with 10,181 questions and 5,693 unique queries across 200 databases. BIRD addresses real-world scenarios, featuring 12,751 question-SQL pairs on 95 large-scale databases with ”dirty” data and evaluating both accuracy and efficiency.To ensure both training efficiency and SQL generation accuracy, this study follows the principles of ”high quality, executable, and low redundancy” for data filtering and optimization. For the training of the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks, we prioritize execution validity checks. Batch execution of reference SQL queries revealed that some samples returned empty results, which, if used for RL training, would fail to provide valid reward signals and could lead to learning biases or ”reward hacking.”\\nBaselines. We compare our MTIR-SQL framework against two primary categories of baseline methods. For supervised fine-tuning, we evaluate Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (Hui et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , a state-of-the-art code generation model fine-tuned on Text-to-SQL datasets using standard cross-entropy loss. For reinforcement learning without tool integration, we implement GRPO on the Qwen3-4B model, using execution accuracy as the reward signal to optimize SQL generation through policy gradient methods. Both baselines use identical training procedures and computational budgets as our proposed framework but lack access to intermediate execution feedback during generation, allowing us to isolate the contribution of Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning.\\nExperimental Details. We conduct experiments using the Qwen3-Instruct model. During training and inference, we adopt database prompts from CodeS (Li et\\xa0al., 2024b ) and SQL-R1 (Ma et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , which provide curated schema components, values, and metadata, and have demonstrated competitive performance on the BIRD benchmark. We employ algorithms such as PPO and GRPO within the RL-Factory framework (Chai et\\xa0al., 2025 ) .The training configuration uses a batch size of 64 and a learning rate of 1e-6. During the rollout phase, we sample 5 outputs for each input at temperature T = 0.6, set the maximum sequence length to 8192, and the maximum number of interactions to N = 6. During inference, we apply greedy decoding (T = 0.0). We use SQLite as the SQL executor to obtain execution feedback. The feedback includes column headers and cell values for up to 10 rows. All experiments are conducted on a system equipped with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\\nPerformance on Main Benchmarks. In the first set of comparisons (Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 ), we evaluate MTIR-SQL against models with different parameter sizes, ranging from under 10B to large-scale models. As shown in Table 1 , our MTIR-SQL model (4B) achieves 64.4% on the BIRD Dev set, which is significantly higher than the other models under 10B parameters. The next best-performing model, SFT Code5-7B, achieves 57.17%, marking a clear advantage for our model despite its smaller size.\\nIn Table 2 , MTIR-SQL (4B) continues to outperform all models in the 10B-30B parameter range, where the best result from SFT Code5-15B is 58.47%. This demonstrates the efficiency of MTIR-SQL in achieving competitive performance even with a smaller model size. Similarly, in Table 3 , we compare MTIR-SQL to large-scale models, including both open-source and proprietary models. Despite the large model sizes (up to 236B parameters), MTIR-SQL (4B) achieves comparable performance to models such as ChatGPT + CoT (64.64%) and SuperSQL (58.50%), showing the robustness and scalability of our approach in handling complex Text-to-SQL tasks.\\nPerformance on Reasoning Paradigms. In Table 4 , we evaluate the performance of different reasoning paradigms on Text-to-SQL benchmarks, specifically focusing on Pass@1 performance across the SPIDER and BIRD datasets. The results highlight the effectiveness of multiturn tool-integrated reasoning.\\nAmong the reasoning paradigms, multi-turn TIR with GRPO-Filter leads to the highest performance on both the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks. The BIRD Dev score of 63.1% represents a significant improvement over standard reasoning and tool-integrated reasoning paradigms, which score 48.1% and 47.6%, respectively. In SPIDER Dev and Test, multi-turn TIR with GRPO filter also excels, achieving 82.4% and 83.4%, respectively, marking a clear advantage over other paradigms.\\nThis reinforces the importance of incorporating execution feedback through multi-turn reasoning for enhancing performance in real-world Text-to-SQL tasks, particularly when dealing with complex databases like SPIDER and BIRD.\\nAblation Study of RL Methods. To assess the effectiveness of MTIR-SQL, we conducted comparisons against PPO, GRPO, and our improved GRPO-Filter using the Qwen3-4B model. As illustrated in Figure 3 and summarized in Table 4 , GRPO converges more rapidly than PPO due to the absence of a critic warm-up phase, but it often suffers from reward collapse in later training stages. PPO, in contrast, provides greater stability but at the cost of slower convergence. Crucially, GRPO-Filter addresses these limitations by selectively filtering low-quality rollouts and removing the KL constraint, thereby stabilizing multi-turn training while achieving substantial performance gains. This demonstrates that our modifications are not merely incremental but essential for enabling robust reinforcement learning in execution-aware Text-to-SQL tasks.\\nAblation Study on Max Turns. We further analyzed the impact of maximum tool calling turns by conducting experiments with settings of 1, 3, and 6. The training curves are shown in Figure 4 , and the quantitative results are summarized in Table 4 . The main findings are as follows: (1) Larger Max Turns generally lead to higher final rewards and stronger overall performance. More turns provide the model with additional opportunities to explore, optimize responses, and execute complex tasks; (2) However, excessive turns (such as 6) may also result in training instability, occasionally causing reward saturation or collapse phenomena; (3) Although Max Turns = 1 demonstrates faster convergence, due to severely limited interaction flexibility, there exists a gap between the final performance and optimal values.\\nAblation Study on Reward Design. This ablation study evaluates the impact of removing each reward component on the model’s performance using the BIRD Development set:\\nR f R_{\\\\text{f}} (Exploration Reward): Removing the exploration reward shows that a moderate increase in its value (from 0 to 0.1) improves performance from 62.3% to 63.1%, a 0.8% increase. However, further increases (to 0.2) cause a significant drop in performance, from 63.1% to 60.5% (a 4.1% decline), indicating that excessive exploration rewards can negatively impact performance. A slight recovery is observed at 0.3 (60.5% to 61.2%, a 1.2% increase), suggesting that a balanced exploration reward is beneficial, but it should not be overemphasized.\\nR e R_{\\\\text{e}} (Execution Reward): Removing the execution reward results in the largest performance drop, from 63.1% to 59.4% (a 3.9% decrease), highlighting its crucial role in the natural language-to-SQL conversion process. Without execution-based feedback, the model struggles to make accurate predictions.\\nR r R_{\\\\text{r}} (Result Reward): Excluding the result reward leads to a smaller decline in performance, from 63.1% to 58.8% (a 4.3% drop), underlining its importance in ensuring the functional correctness of the model’s SQL queries.\\nIn conclusion, removing any reward—particularly R e R_{\\\\text{e}} —significantly hampers the model’s performance. This underscores the necessity of a balanced reward system that integrates execution feedback, exploration, and result accuracy for optimal performance.',\n",

Crucially, GRPO-Filter addresses these limitations by selectively filtering low-quality rollouts and removing the KL constraint, thereby stabilizing multi-turn training while achieving substantial performance gains. This demonstrates that our modifications are not merely incremental but essential for enabling robust reinforcement learning in execution-aware Text-to-SQL tasks.\\nAblation Study on Max Turns. We further analyzed the impact of maximum tool calling turns by conducting experiments with settings of 1, 3, and 6. The training curves are shown in Figure 4 , and the quantitative results are summarized in Table 4 . The main findings are as follows: (1) Larger Max Turns generally lead to higher final rewards and stronger overall performance. More turns provide the model with additional opportunities to explore, optimize responses, and execute complex tasks; (2) However, excessive turns (such as 6) may also result in training instability, occasionally causing reward saturation or collapse phenomena; (3) Although Max Turns = 1 demonstrates faster convergence, due to severely limited interaction flexibility, there exists a gap between the final performance and optimal values.\\nAblation Study on Reward Design. This ablation study evaluates the impact of removing each reward component on the model’s performance using the BIRD Development set:\\nR f R_{\\\\text{f}} (Exploration Reward): Removing the exploration reward shows that a moderate increase in its value (from 0 to 0.1) improves performance from 62.3% to 63.1%, a 0.8% increase. However, further increases (to 0.2) cause a significant drop in performance, from 63.1% to 60.5% (a 4.1% decline), indicating that excessive exploration rewards can negatively impact performance. A slight recovery is observed at 0.3 (60.5% to 61.2%, a 1.2% increase), suggesting that a balanced exploration reward is beneficial, but it should not be overemphasized.\\nR e R_{\\\\text{e}} (Execution Reward): Removing the execution reward results in the largest performance drop, from 63.1% to 59.4% (a 3.9% decrease), highlighting its crucial role in the natural language-to-SQL conversion process. Without execution-based feedback, the model struggles to make accurate predictions.\\nR r R_{\\\\text{r}} (Result Reward): Excluding the result reward leads to a smaller decline in performance, from 63.1% to 58.8% (a 4.3% drop), underlining its importance in ensuring the functional correctness of the model’s SQL queries.\\nIn conclusion, removing any reward—particularly R e R_{\\\\text{e}} —significantly hampers the model’s performance. This underscores the necessity of a balanced reward system that integrates execution feedback, exploration, and result accuracy for optimal performance.',\n",

Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback, which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves 64.4% accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev, significantly outperforming existing approaches.'},\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'The diagnosis of mental disorders remains one of the most complex and nuanced challenges in clinical medicine. Unlike many physical illnesses, which can be confirmed through objective tests such as blood panels, imaging, or genetic screening, psychiatric diagnoses rely heavily on subjective assessment [ 1 ] . The current diagnostic process is predominantly based on conversations between psychiatrists and patients, guided by standardized criteria outlined in manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [ 2 ] . During clinical interviews, psychiatrists assess the patient’s reported symptoms, behavioral cues, emotional responses, and historical context to reach a diagnosis. However, this approach introduces significant variability and subjectivity. Diagnoses can differ between clinicians assessing the same patient, and even the same clinician may interpret similar symptoms differently across patients [ 3 ] . This variability can be attributed to differences in clinical experience, interpersonal dynamics, cultural context, and interpretation of symptom severity or duration [ 4 ] . Moreover, time constraints, communication barriers, and unconscious bias can further compromise diagnostic consistency. These challenges contribute to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, and inconsistent care, ultimately affecting patient outcomes [ 5 ] .\\nIn recent years, advances in artificial intelligence, particularly LLMs [ 6 , 7 ] , have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning. These developments open new avenues for enhancing the diagnostic process in psychiatry by introducing data-driven, scalable, and interpretable decision support systems. In this context, we propose a Fine-Tuned LLM Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] enabled decision support system designed to assist and augment the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. The LLMs in the system are trained/fine-tuned on curated conversational datasets that simulate or replicate psychiatrist–patient interactions related to mental health evaluations, such as those for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and schizophrenia [ 12 , 13 ] . By fine-tuning a set of LLMs on these datasets, the system learns to recognize patterns indicative of specific mental disorders. Predictions from these models are then aggregated through a consensus-based reasoning process, led by OpenAI-gpt-oss, a dedicated reasoning LLM that evaluates and refines the diagnostic output. The specialized orchestration LLM agent [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] coordinates communication between components, ensuring an end-to-end workflow that is accurate, interpretable, and aligned with DSM-5 diagnostic standards [ 17 ] . To enable deployment in resource-constrained environments, each model is fine-tuned using the Unsloth library on Google Colab GPUs [ 18 ] with Low-Rank Adaptation and 4-bit quantization (QLoRA) [ 19 ] , ensuring high performance with minimal computational overhead. The proposed approach aims not to replace clinicians but to support them with a robust, evidence-based, and transparent tool that improves diagnostic precision and consistency. The following are our main contributions of this research.\\nFine-tuning a consortium of LLMs to analyze conversational data and predict diagnoses of mental disorders.\\nIncorporating the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning model to provide the final diagnosis based on the LLM consortium’s predictions.\\nAutomating the end-to-end diagnostic decision-making process for mental disorders through an LLM consortium integrated with the OpenAI-gpt-oss model, orchestrated by LLM agents to ensure transparency, reliability, and adherence to Responsible AI principles.\\nImplementing the prototype of the platform, integrating three LLMs with OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia, USA.\\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the core technologies that underpin the proposed AI-assisted psychiatric diagnostic platform. Section 3 details the overall system architecture, highlighting the integration of large language models and reasoning engines. Section 4 outlines the platform’s core functionalities and operational workflow. Section 5 presents implementation details and evaluates the system’s performance across diagnostic tasks. Section 6 reviews related work and contextualizes our approach within the landscape of LLM-based medical diagnosis systems. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and discusses potential directions for future research and clinical deployment.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'This section provides a foundational overview of the core technologies underpinning the proposed AI-assisted psychiatric diagnostic platform. In particular, we highlight advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), reasoning-capable LLMs, fine-tuning techniques, and the emerging paradigm of AI agents.\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are advanced deep neural networks trained on extensive text corpora to comprehend, generate, and reason using natural language. They form the backbone of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems [ 20 ] and have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, including text summarization, machine translation, dialogue generation, and question answering [ 6 ] .\\nSeveral prominent LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT [ 21 ] , Meta’s Llama [ 22 , 7 ] , Mistral [ 23 ] , and Alibaba’s Qwen2 [ 24 ] are available in both proprietary and open-source formats. Open-source LLMs offer significant advantages for healthcare applications, including transparency, customizability, and lower deployment costs. For instance, Llama-3 [ 22 , 7 ] is valued for its compact architecture and strong performance, even on resource-constrained systems. Mistral [ 25 ] features optimized attention mechanisms for faster inference, while Qwen2 [ 24 ] is designed for multilingual and on-device use, making it suitable for scalable, privacy-preserving deployments.\\nWhile foundational LLMs excel in pattern recognition and natural language generation, they often lack the capacity for structured, multi-step reasoning. Reasoning LLMs [ 8 ] address this limitation by being specifically designed or fine-tuned to synthesize diverse inputs, resolve conflicting information, and support logical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional LLMs that primarily rely on next-token prediction, reasoning models simulate higher-order cognitive functions akin to human deductive reasoning [ 21 , 26 ] .\\nOpenAI-gpt-oss [ 9 , 27 ] is a reasoning LLM designed to perform advanced evaluative and comparative tasks across multiple inputs. Unlike traditional generative LLMs that focus on single-output prediction, OpenAI-gpt-oss is capable of synthesizing responses, resolving contradictions, and applying logical inference to arrive at consistent, well-reasoned conclusions. It excels in tasks involving multi-model output reconciliation, ranking, and consensus generation. These capabilities make it particularly suitable for applications that require structured reasoning, such as diagnostic decision support, content validation, and multi-agent coordination, where interpretability and reliability are critical.\\nFine-tuning is a technique for adapting pre-trained LLMs to specific downstream tasks or domains. It involves retraining the model on curated datasets that reflect the target domain’s language, structure, and semantics, allowing the model to produce outputs more aligned with specialized applications such as clinical diagnostics [ 28 , 29 ] .\\nTo optimize for efficiency and scalability of fine-tuning, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [ 30 ] is commonly used. LoRA introduces trainable low-rank matrices into the transformer architecture, enabling task-specific adaptation while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. In resource-constrained environments, Quantized LoRA (QLoRA) [ 19 ] provides an even more memory-efficient approach by quantizing model weights to 4-bit representations. QLoRA retains most of the performance benefits of full-precision fine-tuning while dramatically reducing memory and compute requirements. Together, these techniques make fine-tuning large models feasible on modest hardware, supporting wider adoption of LLMs in specialized domains.\\nSeveral open-source libraries facilitate efficient fine-tuning workflows for LLMs. Unsloth [ 31 ] , for example, enables high-speed, memory-efficient fine-tuning of models such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen using LoRA and QLoRA techniques. It is optimized for both consumer-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090) and cloud-based environments, including TPU-enabled platforms like Google Colab [ 18 ] . Successful fine-tuning of large models generally requires GPUs with ample VRAM and compute capabilities. High-performance GPUs such as the NVIDIA A100 (40GB/80GB) and H100 are well-suited for large-scale training workloads, while more accessible GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090 and Tesla T4 provide sufficient resources for small to medium-scale fine-tuning and prototyping [ 32 ] .\\nAI agents are autonomous computational entities designed to perform complex tasks by interacting with data sources, machine learning models, and external APIs within dynamic or uncertain environments. When these agents are powered by LLMs, they are referred to as LLM agents, capable of interpreting natural language instructions, generating structured outputs, managing tasks, and coordinating actions across digital ecosystems [ 14 , 15 ] .\\nAgentic AI extends this concept by organizing multiple LLM agents into collaborative, role-specialized systems that demonstrate advanced capabilities such as long-term planning, self-reflection, adaptive behavior, and multi-agent coordination [ 15 , 33 ] . These systems operate through agent hierarchies or workflows in which each agent performs a specific role, such as prompt engineering, retrieval, inference, evaluation, or integration. The modularity of agentic architectures enhances scalability, interpretability, and reusability, making them particularly suitable for domains requiring structured reasoning, task delegation, and reliable decision support.',\n",

This centralized repository is designed to support the training and fine-tuning [ 34 ] of LLMs for predictive psychiatric diagnosis. It hosts a diverse collection of large-scale, labeled datasets comprising transcribed conversations, symptom narratives, and corresponding clinician-verified diagnoses—aligned with standardized diagnostic frameworks such as the DSM-5 [ 35 , 36 ] .

The OpenAI-gpt-oss model leverages its advanced reasoning capabilities to evaluate and synthesize the collective outputs of the LLM consortium, ultimately generating a refined and consistent diagnostic prediction. By adapting prompts to match the input requirements and context of each model, the LLM Agent Layer ensures optimal information flow and model interoperability [ 14 ] .

This stage is crucial for transforming general-purpose models into specialized diagnostic agents capable of interpreting psychiatrist–patient conversations and identifying symptoms of mental disorders. Multiple state-of-the-art models, including Llama-3 [ 22 , 7 ] , Mistral [ 25 ] , and Qwen2 [ 24 ] , are fine-tuned on this domain-specific dataset to adapt them to the unique linguistic and contextual characteristics of psychiatric evaluations. The structure and composition of the dataset used for fine-tuning are illustrated in Figure 3 .\\nThe fine-tuning process is carried out using the Unsloth library [ 31 ] , which facilitates efficient large-scale model adaptation. To ensure that models are deployable on consumer-grade hardware without compromising performance, the fine-tuning process incorporates Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA) [ 19 ] with 4-bit quantization as depicted in Figure 4 . This optimization significantly reduces memory and computational requirements, making the models suitable for real-time inference and edge deployment.\\nUpon completion, the fine-tuned and quantized models are deployed via Ollama [ 42 , 11 ] , a lightweight framework optimized to manage and run LLMs efficiently. These specialized models form the diagnostic core of the platform, each capable of analyzing psychiatric dialogue and producing preliminary mental disorder predictions based on learned diagnostic patterns and criteria aligned with DSM-5.\\nFollowing the fine-tuning process, the next phase of the platform involves generating preliminary diagnoses of mental disorders using the consortium of fine-tuned LLMs. When new conversational data is received between a psychiatrist and a patient, the platform’s LLM Agents initiate diagnostic analysis by interfacing with fine-tuned models through the Ollama API [ 42 ] . To facilitate accurate and context-aware predictions, the LLM Agent employs custom prompt engineering, embedding the relevant conversation data and structured diagnostic context into customized prompts for each model [ 47 ] . These prompts are carefully designed to align with the LLM input expectations and to provide adequate clinical representation, such as duration of symptoms, emotional tone, and functional impact, based on the diagnostic criteria of DSM-5. Each fine-tuned model then analyzes the provided input, extracts potential symptoms, and produces its own diagnostic prediction. These individual outputs are collected by the LLM Agent, which organizes them into a structured format for downstream processing. This step ensures that the specialized capabilities of fine-tuned LLM are fully utilized to provide rich, reliable, and interpretable diagnostic insights into potential mental health conditions.\\nBy allowing multiple independent evaluations throughout the model consortium, this layer improves diagnostic diversity, robustness, and the general ability of the platform to generalize in diverse patient presentations.\\nTo ensure the highest level of diagnostic accuracy, reliability, and clinical validity, the platform employs a consensus-based decision-making mechanism to generate the final diagnosis. Rather than relying on the output of a single model, the platform aggregates diagnostic predictions from multiple fine-tuned LLMs within the consortium. These individual outputs are then evaluated, compared, and synthesized by OpenAI-gpt-oss, a specialized reasoning LLM designed to perform advanced analytical inference [ 44 , 16 ] . As a core component of the architecture, OpenAI-gpt-oss acts as an intelligent adjudicator, capable of contextualizing, validating, and refining the predictions provided by the underlying LLMs. Using its advanced reasoning capabilities, OpenAI-gpt-oss identifies the most consistent and clinically appropriate diagnostic result from a diverse set of model-generated insights.\\nTo enable this reasoning process, the LLM Agent constructs custom, structured prompts by embedding and organizing the outputs from the fine-tuned models. These prompts, as illustrated in Figure 5 , provide OpenAI-gpt-oss with a unified view of candidate diagnoses, associated symptoms, and contextual cues. The reasoning LLM processes this composite input and produces a final diagnosis that aligns with the DSM-5 criteria and reflects a well-supported clinical interpretation [ 36 ] . This consensus-driven architecture significantly improves the robustness and generalizability of diagnostic predictions by mitigating the limitations of individual models and reducing variability. By orchestrating this process through a transparent, explainable pipeline, the platform not only increases trustworthiness but also establishes a replicable framework for AI-assisted psychiatric evaluation.\\nThe integration of ensemble-based inference with symbolic reasoning marks a transformative shift in mental health diagnostics, offering a scalable and interpretable decision support tool for clinicians.

       "    'paragraphs': 'The implementation of the proposed platform was conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport News, Virginia, USA. The LLM layer and reasoning Layer comprises of three fine-tuned LLMs, including Llama-3 [ 7 ] , Mistral [ 25 ] , and Qwen [ 24 ] , and OpenAI-gpt-oss [ 8 , 27 ] reasoning LLM. The LLM Agent Layer was implemented using OpenAI Agents SDK [ 48 ] and Google Agent Development Kit [ 49 ] , enabling secure orchestration, transparent auditability, and decentralized control of the LLM interactions.\\nFine-tuning was conducted using the Unsloth library [ 31 ] on Google Colab, leveraging both NVIDIA A100 GPUs and Tesla TPUs [ 18 ] to support efficient and scalable training cycles. The original dataset consisted of approximately 2,000 annotated records, each containing a psychiatrist–patient conversation, the doctor’s diagnostic reasoning, and the corresponding final diagnosis. These records were compiled from multiple data sources, as illustrated in Figure 3 .\\nThe Unsloth framework requires the input data to be structured in a conversational format [ 31 ] . To meet this requirement, the dataset was preprocessed and transformed into the required schema, shown in Figure 6 . Each training sample includes the fields: instruction (providing context or a prompt to the LLM), content (representing the main conversational input), and text (containing the model’s expected diagnostic reasoning output). The dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets using a 2/3, 1/6, 1/6 split, respectively. The training process was completed in approximately 1,627 seconds (27.12 minutes). Peak memory reservation during training was 14.605 GB, with actual memory utilization reaching 5.853 GB, equivalent to 39.69% of the reserved memory and 99.03% of the peak allocation. These results demonstrate that fine-tuning large language models for psychiatric diagnosis using structured conversational data can be performed efficiently on moderate-scale datasets, even with limited hardware resources. This underscores the practicality and accessibility of applying LLMs in specialized domains such as mental health.\\nAfter fine-tuning, the models were quantized using QLoRA [ 19 ] , a process that enables efficient operation on consumer-grade hardware. This optimization was critical for deploying the fine-tuned models on Ollama, a framework designed for the lightweight yet high-performance execution of LLMs. Based on the predictions of the LLMs, OpenAI-gpt-oss LLM makes the final diagnosis of the mental illness. Custom prompts are used to instruct the OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM to understand the context of the prediction. Based on the provided context and the predictions of the LLMs, the model makes the final diagnosis prediction. Platform performance is evaluated in three main areas: 1) Evaluation of LLM fine-tuning, 2) Diagnostic Performance of Fine-Tuned LLM Consortium, and 3) Diagnostic Reasoning Performance of the OpenAI-gpt-oss LLM.\\nThis evaluation focuses on measuring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process in improving the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs within the platform. Specifically, we evaluated the performance of the fine-tuned Llama-3 model in its ability to identify psychiatric symptoms and produce accurate diagnoses based on conversational data between psychiatrists and patients [ 50 ] .\\nThroughout the fine-tuning process, we continuously monitored critical metrics—specifically, training loss and validation loss—to assess the model’s learning dynamics and generalization ability [ 28 ] . As shown in Figure 9 , the training loss (Figure 7 ) and validation loss (Figure 8 ) both exhibit a steep decline during the initial training steps, indicating rapid learning and effective assimilation of domain-specific patterns. The validation loss continues to decrease smoothly over time, stabilizing around step 25, which suggests improved generalization to unseen samples. Meanwhile, the training loss decreases more aggressively and plateaus slightly earlier, signaling convergence. Figure 9 provides an integrated visualization of both metrics along with the area between the curves, which quantifies the generalization gap. This shaded area (2̃.41) highlights the difference between training and validation performance. The relatively narrow and consistently shrinking gap further confirms the model’s ability to generalize well without overfitting. These trends collectively indicate that the fine-tuning process was effective and stable, enabling the LLM to adapt precisely to the psychiatric diagnostic domain while maintaining performance on unseen conversational data.\\nFigure 10 captures multiple key training dynamics, including the loss difference, loss ratio, and loss derivatives over training steps, offering valuable insights into the model’s convergence behavior and generalization performance. The consistently positive loss difference (validation loss exceeding training loss) suggests signs of overfitting, especially at steps with noticeable spikes. The loss ratio, ranging from 1.0 to 3.0, highlights varying degrees of generalization, where a lower ratio reflects better alignment between training and validation performance. Additionally, the loss derivatives reveal rapid initial improvements followed by smaller, oscillating changes, indicating stabilization or saturation in the learning process [ 51 ] .\\nFollowing the training phase, we assessed the predictive performance of the fine-tuned models in the context of psychiatric diagnosis. This evaluation involved comparing real diagnostic annotations—based on psychiatrist–patient conversations—with the predictions generated by both the baseline (pre-trained) LLMs and their fine-tuned counterparts.\\nFigure 11 and Figure 12 present the diagnostic predictions made by the Llama-3 model [ 22 , 7 ] before and after fine-tuning for two psychiatric conditions: Major Depressive Disorder (DSM-5 296.21) and Bipolar I Disorder, Current Episode Manic (DSM-5 296.41) [ 52 ] . Before fine-tuning, the model generated verbose but loosely structured outputs, relying on high-level symptom descriptions without explicitly mapping them to DSM-5 diagnostic codes [ 2 ] . While it identified relevant symptoms (e.g., euphoric mood, insomnia, and loss of appetite), it did not consistently align them with standardized diagnostic criteria. After fine-tuning on a domain-specific dataset, the model demonstrated significantly improved diagnostic precision. It accurately produced concise and clinically valid diagnoses with correct DSM-5 codes, directly inferred from the contextual patient-physician conversations. This highlights the effectiveness of targeted fine-tuning in enhancing clinical reasoning and diagnostic accuracy in mental health applications.\\nFigure 14 and Figure 13 illustrate the diagnostic predictions produced by the Mistral model [ 23 ] for Panic Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) [ 53 ] . Before fine-tuning, Mistral was able to recognize relevant clinical symptoms from the conversation and partially align them with DSM-5 criteria. For instance, in the panic disorder case, the model identified key features such as shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and anticipatory anxiety about future attacks. Similarly, for PTSD, it recognized trauma exposure, intrusive flashbacks, and avoidance behaviors, citing appropriate DSM-5 criteria. However, after fine-tuning, the model demonstrated improved diagnostic specificity and accuracy. It produced concise and direct classifications that fully matched the DSM-5 diagnostic codes (e.g., DSM-5 300.01 for Panic Disorder and DSM-5 309.81 for PTSD) [ 36 ] . This confirms that fine-tuning enhanced Mistral’s capacity for structured clinical reasoning and reliable psychiatric diagnosis from patient-doctor dialogues.\\nFigure 16 and Figure 15 present the diagnostic outputs generated by the Qwen2 model [ 54 ] for Schizophrenia and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, respectively [ 55 ] . Prior to fine-tuning, the model identified relevant symptoms and attempted to match them to DSM-5 criteria. However, the predictions were often verbose, interpretative, and occasionally lacked clinical precision. After fine-tuning on the psychiatric dataset, the Qwen2 model accurately mapped symptom clusters to their corresponding DSM-5 diagnoses with greater clarity and conciseness, yielding outputs that are more aligned with psychiatric clinical standards.\\nThese results demonstrate that the fine-tuned models consistently produce predictions that closely align with clinically validated diagnoses, showing improved precision, consistency, and interpretability. Compared to their baseline versions, the fine-tuned LLMs exhibit a substantial increase in diagnostic accuracy, underscoring the effectiveness of task-specific fine-tuning in mental health applications. These findings validate the utility of LLMs as decision-support tools in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis.\\nIn this evaluation, we assessed the diagnostic reasoning performance of the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM by comparing its final diagnosis predictions with those generated independently by multiple fine-tuned LLMs. The goal was to evaluate OpenAI-gpt-oss’s ability to synthesize diverse diagnostic outputs and determine the most accurate and clinically appropriate outcome. Figure 17 illustrates a comparative analysis of the diagnostic predictions from the Llama-3, Mistral, and Qwen2 models, alongside the final output produced by OpenAI-gpt-oss. The figure highlights the reasoning model’s ability to interpret and reconcile varying predictions, applying structured clinical logic to arrive at a DSM-5-aligned diagnosis. The results demonstrate that OpenAI-gpt-oss significantly enhances diagnostic reliability by evaluating the coherence and clinical relevance of the LLM consortium’s outputs. This consensus-driven reasoning step adds an important layer of interpretability and robustness, reinforcing the value of integrating a dedicated reasoning LLM within the framework for AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Recent advances have seen LLMs and multimodal AI systems increasingly applied across a wide range of healthcare domains. These efforts collectively highlight the expanding capabilities of LLMs in clinical reasoning, decision support, and medical knowledge retrieval. Despite these advancements, most prior work remains focused on general medicine or physical health domains, with limited specialization in psychiatric evaluation or adherence to standardized diagnostic frameworks such as the DSM‑5. Furthermore, while individual models often perform well in isolated tasks, they rarely incorporate structured reasoning or multi-model coordination—critical components for nuanced psychiatric assessments. Table 1 presents a comparative analysis of these prior systems in relation to our proposed framework. In the subsections that follow, we provide a detailed overview of each relevant system’s architecture, capabilities, and relevance to psychiatric diagnostic support.\\nThe Med‑PaLM family of models, including Med‑PaLM and Med‑PaLM-2, developed by Google Research, represents some of the most advanced and widely evaluated LLMs for clinical and biomedical tasks [ 56 ] . These models are fine-tuned versions of the PaLM (Pathways Language Model) foundation model, tailored to the medical domain through instruction tuning using a combination of publicly available medical datasets, expert-annotated clinical examples, and proprietary benchmarks.\\nMed‑PaLM-2 demonstrated expert-level competency, achieving over 85% accuracy on U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)–style multiple-choice questions, including datasets such as MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Notably, in head-to-head evaluations, physicians preferred Med‑PaLM-2’s long-form answers to those written by human experts across multiple dimensions, including factual correctness, comprehensiveness, and safety. The model also performed well on several open-ended generation tasks, such as consumer health question answering and summarization of clinical information.\\nIn addition to the text-only versions, a multimodal extension called Med‑PaLM-M was developed, enabling the model to jointly reason over textual and visual inputs. This includes radiology images, dermatology photos, pathology slides, and ophthalmic scans. Evaluated on the MultiMedBench benchmark, Med‑PaLM-M demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse tasks encompassing classification, retrieval, and open-ended question answering with multimodal inputs. The model is capable of interpreting complex visual patterns and aligning them with clinical narratives, allowing for integrated diagnostic reasoning that mirrors specialist workflows.\\nFurthermore, the Med‑PaLM series introduces an ethical framework and rigorous safety assessments for AI in healthcare. This includes human evaluation protocols to assess bias, hallucination risks, and alignment with clinical guidelines. Despite its strengths, limitations remain—such as interpretability challenges and dependence on high-quality supervised data—underscoring the need for hybrid frameworks that can further ensure trust and safety in clinical applications.\\nThe “LLM for DDx” framework [ 57 ] investigates the application of LLMs to the task of generating differential diagnoses from clinical vignettes, including both structured patient data and free-text clinical notes. By leveraging prompt engineering techniques, the system guides the LLM to output ranked diagnostic hypotheses based on symptomatology, patient history, and clinical context. This framework adopts few-shot or zero-shot prompting, often augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning or self-consistency sampling, to simulate a clinician’s diagnostic reasoning. The model is evaluated on publicly available datasets such as MedQA, MIMIC-III case notes, and Clinical Case Challenge benchmarks. It demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing comorbidities, parsing temporal disease progression, and identifying rare or underrepresented conditions—tasks that often challenge traditional rule-based decision support systems. One of the key strengths of this approach lies in its adaptability: the model can generalize across specialties (e.g., internal medicine, neurology, pediatrics) without needing task-specific retraining. However, the system does not integrate multimodal data sources (e.g., lab results, imaging), and lacks structured inference mechanisms like probabilistic reasoning or iterative refinement via specialized LLMs. As such, its diagnostic accuracy can be sensitive to prompt phrasing and input variability, necessitating human-in-the-loop oversight for safe clinical deployment. Despite these limitations, the work highlights the potential of LLMs to augment differential diagnosis in resource-constrained or high-ambiguity settings, offering a foundation for future systems that incorporate more structured reasoning pipelines and multimodal data fusion.\\nMe‑Llama [ 37 ] adapts the Llama architecture for biomedical applications through a two-phase process: (1) continual pretraining on large-scale biomedical corpora—including PubMed articles, clinical guidelines, and de-identified electronic health records (EHRs); and (2) instruction tuning using curated clinical dialogues and task-specific prompts aligned with workflows typical in patient care. The model is optimized for downstream tasks such as clinical note summarization, medical question answering, and evidence extraction from unstructured clinical documents. Benchmarks show that Me‑Llama outperforms general-purpose LLMs on several biomedical NLP tasks, including the BioASQ challenge, PubMedQA, and MedNLI. Despite being limited to text-only inputs (i.e., it does not incorporate imaging, waveform, or wearable sensor data), Me‑Llama exhibits a strong semantic understanding of biomedical terminology, abbreviations, and guideline-referenced medical reasoning. Its lightweight fine-tuning also makes it suitable for deployment in edge healthcare systems, such as point-of-care mobile applications and hospital EMR-integrated tools. Overall, Me‑Llama demonstrates the feasibility and performance benefits of domain-specific LLM adaptation within clinical language environments.\\nDrHouse [ 45 ] introduces an advanced virtual provider assistant system that integrates LLM-based diagnostic reasoning with real-time physiological data collected from consumer-grade wearable sensors (e.g., smart watches, sleep trackers, fitness monitors). The system continuously monitors health signals such as heart rate variability, blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), sleep quality, step count, and circadian rhythm alignment, enabling longitudinal health tracking and context-aware decision-making. In contrast to static, prompt-only systems, DrHouse engages users through multi-turn, adaptive dialogues that emulate the back-and-forth of a clinical consultation. The LLM component dynamically adjusts its diagnostic hypotheses using an iterative concurrent reasoning framework—recalculating disease likelihoods as new data or clarifications are introduced. Additionally, DrHouse retrieves up-to-date medical knowledge from external expert databases such as UpToDate, PubMed abstracts, and clinical guidelines, thereby ensuring that recommendations remain grounded in the latest medical evidence.\\nThe system employs a dual-loop architecture that balances real-time inference with long-term patient modeling. It maintains an evolving profile of each user’s medical baseline and incorporates Bayesian-style updates for probabilistic diagnosis refinement. DrHouse was evaluated on both public benchmark datasets (e.g., MedQA, Symptoma) and proprietary longitudinal datasets derived from wearable telemetry and self-reported health surveys. Quantitatively, the model achieved up to an 18.8% improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to baseline LLMs without sensor fusion. Qualitatively, user studies showed that 91.7% of patients found the interaction intuitive and trustworthy, while 75% of clinicians expressed confidence in its ability to support primary care triage.

By leveraging prompt engineering techniques, the system guides the LLM to output ranked diagnostic hypotheses based on symptomatology, patient history, and clinical context. This framework adopts few-shot or zero-shot prompting, often augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning or self-consistency sampling, to simulate a clinician’s diagnostic reasoning. The model is evaluated on publicly available datasets such as MedQA, MIMIC-III case notes, and Clinical Case Challenge benchmarks. It demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing comorbidities, parsing temporal disease progression, and identifying rare or underrepresented conditions—tasks that often challenge traditional rule-based decision support systems. One of the key strengths of this approach lies in its adaptability: the model can generalize across specialties (e.g., internal medicine, neurology, pediatrics) without needing task-specific retraining. However, the system does not integrate multimodal data sources (e.g., lab results, imaging), and lacks structured inference mechanisms like probabilistic reasoning or iterative refinement via specialized LLMs. As such, its diagnostic accuracy can be sensitive to prompt phrasing and input variability, necessitating human-in-the-loop oversight for safe clinical deployment. Despite these limitations, the work highlights the potential of LLMs to augment differential diagnosis in resource-constrained or high-ambiguity settings, offering a foundation for future systems that incorporate more structured reasoning pipelines and multimodal data fusion.',\n",

Recognizing the inherent subjectivity and variability in traditional mental health assessments—often based on unstructured clinical interviews—we proposed a novel architecture that leverages conversational data, custom prompt engineering, and multi-model consensus reasoning to replicate and improve upon clinical diagnostic workflows. The platform is structured into four key layers: the Data Lake Layer for managing annotated psychiatrist–patient dialogues; the fine-tuned LLM Layer for training models specialized in symptom analysis; the LLM Agent Layer for orchestrating model interactions and prompt generation; and the OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning Layer, which synthesizes model outputs into a final, reliable diagnosis aligned with DSM-5 criteria. Our approach demonstrates that AI systems, when trained and orchestrated properly, can support mental health professionals by offering data-driven insights and reducing diagnostic variability. The use of low-rank adapters and quantization techniques further enables efficient deployment on consumer-grade hardware, making the system accessible in real-world clinical and remote care settings. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first end-to-end integration of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with a reasoning engine to standardize psychiatric diagnoses. It lays the foundation for future advancements in AI-assisted eHealth systems, where intelligent agents can augment clinical decision-making while preserving interpretability and ethical responsibility. Future work will focus on clinical validation, multilingual adaptation, and integration with multimodal inputs—such as voice, facial expressions, and affective signals—to enhance diagnostic depth, contextual understanding, and empathy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations, primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on conversational datasets involving psychiatrist–patient interactions focused on mental health conditions (e.g., depression). These models are capable of identifying mental disorders with high accuracy based on natural language input. The diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate seamless communication between the LLM consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Each LLM in the consortium was fine-tuned using the Unsloth library on Google Colab’s Tesla GPUs. To optimize performance on consumer-grade hardware, we employed Low-Rank Adaptation with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA). Experimental results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis—paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.'},\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) leverages the rich semantic information in Knowledge Bases (KB) to deeply understand natural language questions and provide precise answers. Since KBQA holds significant value in applications such as search engines, intelligent healthcare, and financial risk control (Jang et\\xa0al., 2017 ; Wu et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Chen et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , it has garnered extensive attention in recent years. Although KBQA performs well on simple questions, it still struggles with complex questions in real-world scenarios. This difficulty primarily arises from generalizing to a wide range of unseen complex questions and adapting to the heterogeneous structures of KBs.\\nExisting semantic-parsing-based (Shu et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Jiang et\\xa0al., ) and information-retrieval-based KBQA approaches (Liu et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Sun et\\xa0al., 2019 ) rely on predefined workflows (e.g., generate-then-retrieve or retrieve-then-rank pipelines), resulting in error propagation and adaptability limitations. Recently, a series of approaches has adopted an agentic reasoning paradigm. As illustrated in the middle of Fig. 1 , under this paradigm, LLMs autonomously perform task planning, tool calling, and ultimately derive precise answers through multi-turn interactions with KBs. Specifically, existing agentic approaches fall into two categories, i.e., prompting-based (Xiong et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Sun et\\xa0al., ) and finetuning-based approaches (Jiang et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Fang et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Zhu et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . The former uses hand-crafted few-shot prompts to guide reasoning, relying on the intrinsic reasoning ability of LLMs. However, few examples are inadequate for the model to understand complex questions, perceiving the KB structure, resulting in low performance. In response, finetuning-based approaches adapt open-source LLMs by constructing agentic reasoning trajectories and fine-tuning the model to follow them. However, most of them rely on process supervision. Since manually creating high-quality trajectories is labor-intensive, they typically synthesize reasoning trajectories by decomposing gold logical forms (e.g., SPARQL). Besides, they learn from trajectories via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to employ the model with agentic reasoning ability.\\nDespite the progress, existing finetuning-based approaches rely heavily on process supervision both in data generation and model training. They encourage LLMs to exploit idea trajectories rather than autonomously exploring alternative ones. Consequently, they have two critical limitations:\\nLimited Robustness. Under process supervision, as shown in the left part of Fig. 1 , training trajectories are typically decomposed from gold logical forms, with each step being idealized and error-free. However, such trajectories omit the noise and uncertainty inherent in real-world interactions. As a result, models always struggle when exposed to the noisy, such as tool-call failures and empty results, as they are trained on ideal trajectories.\\nLimited Flexibility. For many questions, there exists more than one correct trajectory, and in some cases, certain trajectories may even outperform the gold logical forms. Training on trajectories only derived from gold logical forms constrains the model to low-diversity behavioral patterns. As shown in Fig. 1 , when the model is presented with an example problem containing a“high school” type constraint, it insists on finding a predicate with the meaning “notable type” and applies the type constraint. However, more efficient solutions exist, such as leveraging common sense to identify entities of a specific type from the candidate set, or using “SearchTypes” to more directly constrain the entity types.\\nMotivated by this, in this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1 , an LLM capable of autonomously performing task decomposition, invoking tools, refining formal queries, and executing them to obtain answers. To incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 adopts a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning approach that relies mainly on outcome supervision. First, to break free from the dependency on process annotation, it employs an outcome-based rejection sampling strategy to curate high-quality trajectories and perform to endow the model with a foundational exploration capability. To mitigate the reward sparsity induced by outcome-only signals, KnowCoder-A1 employs multi-stage curriculum RL on reward schedules that progress from easy to hard, steadily strengthening autonomous exploration and complex reasoning. Trained with only around 6700 outcome-supervised samples, KnowCoder-A1 consistently outperforms previous agentic KBQA approaches across three mainstream datasets, i.e., WebQSP, CWQ, and GrailQA. Using 12× less training data, it achieves an F1 score of 80.5% on GrailQA, achieving a 3.3% relative improvement over KBQA-o1, the previous SOTA agentic-based approach. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1 achieves a relative improvement of up to 11.1% compared to KBQA-o1, demonstrating the strong generalization ability of the proposed approach.\\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\\nWe propose KnowCoder-A1 , our first agentic reasoning model for KBQA. Relying mainly on outcome supervision, it learns to act as a robust and flexible agent, capable of recovering from errors and strategically exploring diverse reasoning trajectories.\\nTo address the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, we propose a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with an easy-to-hard curriculum, progressing from easy to hard reward criteria while discouraging reward hacking.\\nExtensive experiments on three mainstream datasets demonstrate that KnowCoder-A1 consistently outperforms previous agentic KBQA approaches, particularly in challenging zero-shot scenarios.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Traditional KBQA methods can be categorized into two primary kinds of approaches: Information Retrieval-based (IR-based) and Semantic Parsing-based (SP-based) ones. IR-based methods (Miller et\\xa0al., 2016 ; Liu et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Sun et\\xa0al., 2019 ; Saxena et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Shi et\\xa0al., 2021 ; Zhang et\\xa0al., 2022 ) first retrieve query-relevant information from the KB and subsequently rank candidate answers. Among IR-based methods, some (Bordes et\\xa0al., 2015 ; Chen et\\xa0al., 2019a ) incorporate a long-term memory component that can be read from and written to, or perform a path-walking process over the KB to derive the answer (Qiu et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Ren et\\xa0al., 2021 ) . SP-based methods (Sun et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Chen et\\xa0al., 2019b ; LAN & JIANG, ; Jiang et\\xa0al., ; Ye et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Shu et\\xa0al., 2022 ) transform the natural language question into a logical query, link the entities and relations, and execute the completed query to obtain the answer. With the advent of LLMs, they have been employed to enhance both approaches, serving as powerful subgraph retrievers (Zhao et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Liu et\\xa0al., 2024 ) or semantic parsers (Li et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Nie et\\xa0al., 2024 ) . However, these enhancements do not fundamentally alter the predefined, multi-stage workflow, which brings inflexibility and error propagation.\\nRecently, a new paradigm of agentic reasoning has emerged, which views the LLM as an agent that uses tools to interact with the KB, progressively reason, and finally find the answer. We call them agentic methods in this paper. They can be divided into two main categories: prompt-based and finetuning-based ones. The former methods, such as Interactive-KBQA (Xiong et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , QueryAgent (Huang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , Readi (Cheng et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , and TOG ( Sun et\\xa0al., ) , leverage carefully designed interaction strategies and prompts to elicit the model’s reasoning capabilities. However, these methods struggle to equip the model with sufficient agentic capability to effectively perceive the KB and execute complex reasoning. Their success is also heavily dependent on the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs, most of which are closed-source and have an extremely large number of parameters. However, the limited number of examples is insufficient for the model to fully comprehend complex questions and capture the underlying KB structure, leading to suboptimal performance. Finetuning-based methods aim to distill reasoning abilities into smaller, open-source LLMs. Approaches (Gu et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Jiang et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Zhu et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Fang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) achieve this by constructing high-quality reasoning trajectories and finetuning on them. However, these trajectories, by decomposing and augmenting gold program annotations and the reliance on process supervision via SFT, limit the model’s capacity for autonomous exploration, resulting in poor robustness and flexibility. Although some recent works have used Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods ( Luo et\\xa0al., ; Xiong et\\xa0al., 2025 ) to expand samples during inference for incremental fine-tuning, this is an indirect way to foster exploration and still operates within the confines of the process-supervised SFT paradigm. Overall, existing finetuning-based methods fall under SFT-based process supervision, which, as noted in Section 1 , struggles to encourage autonomous exploration, leading to less robust and adaptable reasoning trajectories.',\n",

Among IR-based methods, some (Bordes et\\xa0al., 2015 ; Chen et\\xa0al., 2019a ) incorporate a long-term memory component that can be read from and written to, or perform a path-walking process over the KB to derive the answer (Qiu et\\xa0al., 2020 ; Ren et\\xa0al., 2021 ) .

       "      'paragraphs': 'Recently, a new paradigm of agentic reasoning has emerged, which views the LLM as an agent that uses tools to interact with the KB, progressively reason, and finally find the answer. We call them agentic methods in this paper. They can be divided into two main categories: prompt-based and finetuning-based ones. The former methods, such as Interactive-KBQA (Xiong et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , QueryAgent (Huang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , Readi (Cheng et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , and TOG ( Sun et\\xa0al., ) , leverage carefully designed interaction strategies and prompts to elicit the model’s reasoning capabilities. However, these methods struggle to equip the model with sufficient agentic capability to effectively perceive the KB and execute complex reasoning. Their success is also heavily dependent on the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs, most of which are closed-source and have an extremely large number of parameters. However, the limited number of examples is insufficient for the model to fully comprehend complex questions and capture the underlying KB structure, leading to suboptimal performance. Finetuning-based methods aim to distill reasoning abilities into smaller, open-source LLMs. Approaches (Gu et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Jiang et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Zhu et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Fang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) achieve this by constructing high-quality reasoning trajectories and finetuning on them. However, these trajectories, by decomposing and augmenting gold program annotations and the reliance on process supervision via SFT, limit the model’s capacity for autonomous exploration, resulting in poor robustness and flexibility. Although some recent works have used Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods ( Luo et\\xa0al., ; Xiong et\\xa0al., 2025 ) to expand samples during inference for incremental fine-tuning, this is an indirect way to foster exploration and still operates within the confines of the process-supervised SFT paradigm. Overall, existing finetuning-based methods fall under SFT-based process supervision, which, as noted in Section 1 , struggles to encourage autonomous exploration, leading to less robust and adaptable reasoning trajectories.',\n",

We view the KB and the tool executor as the environment: ℳ = ( 𝒢 , Exec ) \\\\mathcal{M}=(\\\\mathcal{G},\\\\ \\\\texttt{Exec}) ,\\nwhere Exec executes tool calls against 𝒢 \\\\mathcal{G} and returns structured observations (including error diagnostics when execution fails). It is worth noting that error messages are retained to provide corrective signals to help LLM refine subsequent tool calls.\\nAction Space. At each step, the agent first produces an explicit thinking process and then makes a tool call from a finite action set Action . We instantiate three tools based on Interactive-KBQA (Xiong et\\xa0al., 2024 ) :\\nSearchTypes (typename): Given a type name, retrieves and ranks candidate types in similarity order.\\nSearchGraphPatterns (sparql, semantic): Given a partial SPARQL sketch (assumed to start with SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {...} ), returns up to 10 one- and two-hop subgraphs in which the variable ?x appears as the head or tail object. An optional semantic parameter can be provided to rank the returned subgraphs in similarity order.\\nExecuteSPARQL (sparql): Given a SPARQL query, executes it against a sandboxed endpoint over 𝒢 \\\\mathcal{G} and returns the result. This enables flexible query on the graph, such as hypothesis testing (e.g., subgraph existence) or end-to-end query execution.\\nState and Trajectory. Let c t c_{t} denote the explicit thinking process in natural language, a t ∈ Action a_{t}\\\\in\\\\textsc{Action} the action, and o t o_{t} the observation at step t t . The trajectory, which also serves as the agent’s state, is the history of all past interactions. The trajectory at step t t is denoted as:\\nInteractive Process. Given a question q q , the agent begins with an initial prompt\\nwhere the instruction consists of a brief task description, tool definitions, and the required interaction format, followed by the question q q and its topic entities E q E_{q} . The specific prompt is provided in the Appendix E .\\nAt each step t t , the agent first generates a thought c t + 1 c_{t+1} and a tool call a t + 1 a_{t+1} conditioned on the current trajectory and the initial prompt:\\nThe tool call a t + 1 a_{t+1} is then passed to the executor, which returns an observation o t + 1 = Exec \\u200b ( a t + 1 ) o_{t+1}=\\\\texttt{Exec}(a_{t+1}) . The new interaction turn ( c t + 1 , a t + 1 , o t + 1 ) (c_{t+1},a_{t+1},o_{t+1}) is appended to the current trajectory to form the trajectory for the next step, τ t + 1 \\\\tau_{t+1} . This iterative process continues until the agent determines it has gathered sufficient information and decides to output the final answer, or reaches T T , the maximum number of steps.\\nDue to the heterogeneous structures of KBs and the complexity of questions, employing a base model with insufficient reasoning and tool-use capabilities as an agent makes it difficult to guarantee the discovery of trajectories to the correct answer. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a cold-start stage where the agent is fine-tuned on reasoning trajectories to acquire foundational perception and reasoning capabilities. Instead of relying on program-decomposed trajectories, we generate trajectories via outcome-based rejection sampling. Moreover, to avoid overfitting while ensuring sufficient guidance, we adhere to the principle of constructing a dataset that is concise, yet high in quality and diversity. In the following, we will first describe this data curation process and then detail the model’s training procedure.\\nAs discussed in Sec. 1 , program-decomposed trajectories used in existing approaches fundamentally lack exploration, resulting in the limited robustness and flexibility of the model.\\nTo overcome the limitations and obtain a high-quality and diverse dataset, we design an outcome-based data construction strategy, the overall pipeline is illustrated in the left panel of Fig. 2 , which contains three core components:\\nFirst, to ensure the model learns a diverse set of fundamental reasoning patterns, we curate a mixed question set using a principled sampling strategy across several sources. From WebQSP, we balance one- and two-hop questions to teach varied reasoning depths. From CWQ, we up-sample infrequent question types to guarantee exposure to complex compositional structures. Finally, from GrailQA, we up-sample questions without topic entities to improve the model’s ability to generalize.\\nNext, to endow the model with stronger exploratory abilities and expand its exploration space, we use a prompt designed to encourage trial-and-error. As the yellow block in Fig. 2 shows, the prompt contains three parts: task description, tool definition, and high-quality demos: a few manually crafted exemplars that demonstrate a general agentic reasoning process, including planning, interacting, and self-correction after errors. Then, we prompt strong models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Flash (Comanici et\\xa0al., 2025 ) and DeepSeek-V3 (Guo et\\xa0al., 2025 ) ) to generate multiple candidate trajectories for each question.\\nAfter that, to ensure the correctness of the trajectories, we apply an outcome-based rejection sampling, filtering the generated trajectories using two criteria, retaining only those that are both correct and fully grounded in evidence:\\nExact-match Correctness. The Exact Match (EM) score (Talmor & Berant, 2018 ) between the predicted and gold answers must be 1 1 . This ensures that at least one of the predicted answers appears in the gold answers, which largely guarantees the correctness of the trajectory.\\nEvidence Grounding. All predicted answers must appear in the observation history { o 0 , … , o T } \\\\{o_{0},\\\\ldots,o_{T}\\\\} , ensuring that the agent does not rely on internal parametric knowledge that could lead to hallucinations during training.\\nFinally, we apply a final filtering step to these trajectories. We ensure that each question has a maximum of three trajectories and that the number of trajectories is equal or balance across the aforementioned question types. The statistics of the resulting cold-start dataset can be found in Table 8 in Appendix C , where the size of the dataset is less than most of the existing methods.\\nIn the fine-tuning stage, we aim to teach the agent to reason over long, complex interaction histories. To achieve this efficiently without losing critical long-term context, we fine-tune the agent on complete trajectories. This approach avoids the disadvantage of alternative methods, which split the trajectory into multiple input-output steps: retaining the full context for each step is computationally inefficient, while using only a limited history window risks severing crucial long-term dependencies.\\nSpecifically, we use the entire history as input but compute the loss only on the agent’s generated tokens, masking out the observation part returned by tools during training. This prevents these external tokens from affecting the loss calculation, ensuring that the retrieved results do not interfere with the model’s internal reasoning and generation processes. The process can be formalized as follows:\\nWe define the input prompt as x x and the expert trajectory as τ \\\\tau . Here the trajectory τ \\\\tau is represented as a sequence of M M tokens, τ = ( y 1 , … , y M ) \\\\tau=(y_{1},\\\\dots,y_{M}) , which comprise the expert’s thoughts and actions. The agent is fine-tuned by maximizing the likelihood of generating this expert trajectory conditioned on the input x x . During training, we specifically mask out observation tokens, computing the loss only on the expert’s thought and action tokens. This objective is formulated as:\\nwhere θ \\\\theta represents the model’s parameters, M M is the total number of tokens in the sequence, y j y_{j} is the j j -th token, and y < j y_{<j} denotes the sequence of preceding tokens ( y 1 , … , y j − 1 ) (y_{1},\\\\dots,y_{j-1}) .\\nBased on the cold-start model, in the RL stage, we aim to further promote autonomous exploration and eliminate the reliance on process supervision. To achieve this, we employ the outcome-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method (Shao et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , where any trajectory leading to a correct answer receives a positive incentive, thereby encouraging the agent to explore and acquire stronger reasoning capabilities. Moreover, to ensure the RL training is both balanced and effective, we implement two key strategies.\\nFirst, to balance the agent’s exploration across question types (e.g., simple vs. complex), we sample a balanced set of questions for the RL training, following a similar principle as in the cold-start stage. Second, to mitigate the reward sparsity induced by outcome-only signals and refine the training process, we introduce a curriculum strategy on the reward, scheduling the reward strictness, guiding the learning process from easy to hard and effectively suppressing reward hacking.\\nIn this section, we first introduce the GRPO method, followed by the design of our data selection and reward curriculum strategies.\\nInspired by the recent success of policy gradient methods on reasoning tasks (Jin et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Xue et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Luo et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , we employ the GRPO method for optimization. GRPO estimates the baseline using the rewards from a group of rollouts for the same query to compute the advantage. In this paper, we adopt a fully on-policy variant of GRPO, which is demonstrated as an effective way to incentivize exploration (He et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . Its objective function can be expressed as follows:\\nHere, q q is the question from the train set D Q D_{Q} , and τ ( i ) \\\\tau^{(i)} is the i i -th trajectory generated by the policy model π θ o \\u200b l \\u200b d \\\\pi_{\\\\theta_{old}} for q q . R \\u200b ( τ ( i ) ) R(\\\\tau^{(i)}) is a scalar reward derived solely from the final outcome of the trajectory. A ^ i , j \\\\hat{A}_{i,j} represents the group-wise relative advantage, which is estimated by normalizing the group-level rewards for the same query, normalized by the standard deviation s \\u200b t \\u200b d \\u200b ( ⋅ ) std(\\\\cdot) to stabilize training. ρ i , j \\u200b ( θ ) \\\\rho_{i,j}(\\\\theta) denotes the token-level importance ratio. π ref \\\\pi_{\\\\text{ref}} is a reference policy (i.e., the model after the cold-start stage), and β \\\\beta controls the strength of the KL loss 𝔻 KL ( ⋅ | | ⋅ ) \\\\mathbb{D}_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}(\\\\cdot||\\\\cdot) towards the reference policy.\\nDuring the earlier phases of RL training, the cold-start model often lack the capability to generate complete and correct reasoning trajectories for complex questions. This results in reward sparsity when relying solely on final outcomes, and meanwhile hinders effective exploration. Thus, we introduce a composite reward function that mitigates reward sparsity by providing denser feedback signals, while guiding the exploration process through a carefully designed easy-to-hard curriculum. The reward is specifically composed of a Format Reward and a multi-phase Answer Reward.\\nFormat Reward ( R fmt R_{\\\\text{fmt}} ). To discourage invalid trajectories and ensure that answers can be reliably parsed for reward calculation, we introduce a format reward. This component checks whether a trajectory adheres to the required format, specifically the presence of the answer box \\\\boxed{} . If the format is correct, we set R fmt = 0.1 R_{\\\\text{fmt}}=0.1 ; otherwise, R fmt = 0.0 R_{\\\\text{fmt}}=0.0 .\\nAnswer Reward ( R ans R_{\\\\text{ans}} ). To verify the correctness of the predicted answer and avoid a sparse reward signal, we evaluate the agreement between the predictions inside \\\\boxed{} and the gold answers using F β F_{\\\\beta} score. Compared with a simple EM score, the F β F_{\\\\beta} score balances precision and recall via an adoptable hyperparameter β \\\\beta , which prevents agents from trivially obtaining a high score by returning a large, low-precision candidate set. Concretely, the F β F_{\\\\beta} score is computed as:\\nwhere 𝒜 ^ \\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{A}} denotes the de-duplicated set of answers produced by the model and 𝒜 q ⋆ \\\\mathcal{A}_{q}^{\\\\star} denotes the set of gold answers, and | ⋅ | |\\\\cdot| denotes multiset cardinality.\\nBased on the answer reward, we employ a curriculum learning strategy by adapting the β \\\\beta parameter. This gradually adjusts the reward difficulty from easy to hard, as illustrated in the top-right part of Figure 2 .\\nPhase 1: Precision-focused Reward. In early training, we set β = 0.5 \\\\beta=0.5 in the answer reward. This precision-leaning objective grants relatively high reward for correct items even when recall is incomplete. As the Fig. 2 shows, if the golden answer is {A1, A2}, a precise but partial prediction {A1} achieves a high reward ( r 2 = 0.83 r_{2}=0.83 ). Conversely, an prediction that includes extraneous items, such as {A1, A2, A3, A4}, is penalized with a lower reward ( r 1 = 0.55 r_{1}=0.55 ), encouraging accurate predictions and preventing the model from hacking the reward by emitting large candidate sets.\\nPhase 2: Balanced Reward. Once the model achieves stable precision, we switch the objective to the F 1 F_{1} score ( β = 1 \\\\beta=1 ), which balances precision and recall. Under this balanced metric, a partial prediction is less rewarded than in Phase 1, incentivizing the agent to explore more thoroughly and recover the full set of correct answers.\\nThe total reward is the sum of the two parts, capped at a maximum value of 1.0:',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'Based on the cold-start model, in the RL stage, we aim to further promote autonomous exploration and eliminate the reliance on process supervision. To achieve this, we employ the outcome-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method (Shao et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , where any trajectory leading to a correct answer receives a positive incentive, thereby encouraging the agent to explore and acquire stronger reasoning capabilities. Moreover, to ensure the RL training is both balanced and effective, we implement two key strategies.\\nFirst, to balance the agent’s exploration across question types (e.g., simple vs. complex), we sample a balanced set of questions for the RL training, following a similar principle as in the cold-start stage. Second, to mitigate the reward sparsity induced by outcome-only signals and refine the training process, we introduce a curriculum strategy on the reward, scheduling the reward strictness, guiding the learning process from easy to hard and effectively suppressing reward hacking.\\nIn this section, we first introduce the GRPO method, followed by the design of our data selection and reward curriculum strategies.\\nInspired by the recent success of policy gradient methods on reasoning tasks (Jin et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Xue et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Luo et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , we employ the GRPO method for optimization. GRPO estimates the baseline using the rewards from a group of rollouts for the same query to compute the advantage. In this paper, we adopt a fully on-policy variant of GRPO, which is demonstrated as an effective way to incentivize exploration (He et\\xa0al., 2025 ) . Its objective function can be expressed as follows:\\nHere, q q is the question from the train set D Q D_{Q} , and τ ( i ) \\\\tau^{(i)} is the i i -th trajectory generated by the policy model π θ o \\u200b l \\u200b d \\\\pi_{\\\\theta_{old}} for q q .

This results in reward sparsity when relying solely on final outcomes, and meanwhile hinders effective exploration. Thus, we introduce a composite reward function that mitigates reward sparsity by providing denser feedback signals, while guiding the exploration process through a carefully designed easy-to-hard curriculum. The reward is specifically composed of a Format Reward and a multi-phase Answer Reward.\\nFormat Reward ( R fmt R_{\\\\text{fmt}} ). To discourage invalid trajectories and ensure that answers can be reliably parsed for reward calculation, we introduce a format reward. This component checks whether a trajectory adheres to the required format, specifically the presence of the answer box \\\\boxed{} .

       "    'paragraphs': 'To prove the effectiveness of KnowCoder-A1 , we conduct comprehensive experiments and present the setup, main results, and analysis in this section. Specifically, we focus on the following research questions (RQ): RQ1: Does KnowCoder-A1 outperform other directly comparable methods? RQ2: Does the main components of KnowCoder-A1 work effectively? RQ3: How does KnowCoder-A1 progressively enhance the agent’s reasoning capability for the KBQA task with outcome-only supervision? RQ4: Does KnowCoder-A1 generates flexible and robust reasoning trajectories?\\nDataset and Metrics . We evaluate KnowCoder-A1 on three widely-used KBQA datasets: WebQSP, CWQ, and the generalization-focused GrailQA, using a subset of the official testing data. Following existing work (Xiong et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , we primarily evaluate the F1 metrics, supplemented by Random Hits@1(RHits@1) and EM score. As our approach does not rely on semantic parsing, we do not report logical form accuracy (Gu et\\xa0al., 2021 ) .\\nBaselines . We compare KnowCoder-A1 against two main categories of methods: prompting-based and fine-tuning-based methods. For the former, we include a diverse range of prompting strategies, from direct prompting, such as IO, CoT, etc., and agent-based reasoning method Interactive-KBQA (Xiong et\\xa0al., 2024 ) . To ensure a fair comparison and reproducibility, we report the scores for these methods directly from their original publications. For the fine-tuning-based methods, we select SOTA methods finetuned on full data, include RnG-KBQA (Ye et\\xa0al., 2022 ) and TIARA (Shu et\\xa0al., 2022 ) , and the directly comparable low-source methods, which are finetuned on low-source data, includes agentic approaches like SFT-traj. (Xiong et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , KBQA-o1 ( Luo et\\xa0al., ) , and MCTS-KBQA (Xiong et\\xa0al., 2025 ) .\\nFurther details on the datasets, baselines, evaluation protocol, and implementation are provided in Appendix A .\\nTo evaluate the performance of KnowCoder-A1 , we conducted comprehensive experiments on three datasets, with the results presented in Table 1 . For additional context on the efficiency of our method, we compare the number of samples used during training with the number of rollouts used during inference in Table 2 . Taken together, these results demonstrate that KnowCoder-A1 establishes a new state-of-the-art for low-resource KBQA across all benchmarks. This shows the effectiveness of our approach, which can be analyzed from three key aspects.\\nFirst, KnowCoder-A1 significantly outperforms all directly comparable low-resource baselines, particularly on the more complex CWQ and the generalization-focused GrailQA datasets. Meanwhile, it nearly closes the gap with fully-supervised methods while using only a fraction of the data (\\xa010k outcome-supervised samples vs. \\xa060k fully-annotated queries), highlighting its exceptional data efficiency.\\nSecond, results prove that the outcome-supervised multi-stage training strategy is effective than the process-supervised SFT strategy.\\nResults in the last two blocks of Table 1 indicate that KnowCoder-A1 our approach consistently outperforms leading process-supervised SFT baselines. On GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1 achieves an F1 score of 80.5%, which represents a 3.3% relative improvement over the prior state-of-the-art method KBQA-o1 while using 12× less training data (3.5k vs. 43.8k samples). While performance is slightly lower on GrailQA’s I.I.D. and compositional subsets, which favor extensive training data to cover specific patterns, our method demonstrates a relative improvement of up to 11.1% on the zero-shot subset. This proves its superior ability to reason effectively on truly unseen questions.\\nFurthermore, beyond higher overall scores, KnowCoder-A1 is more efficient in both supervision and inference. In terms of supervision, as detailed in the “Train” columns of Table 2 , KnowCoder-A1 uses zero process-supervised (P.S.) instances and a comparable or smaller number of outcome-supervised (O.S.) samples than MCTS-based competitors. As montioned before, KnowCoder-A1 outperforms KBQA-o1 on GrailQA while using much fewer supervised samples. In terms of inference, as shown in the “Evaluation” columns of Table 2 , KnowCoder-A1 employs a single linear reasoning pass and avoids the costly sampling required by MCTS, reducing latency by 3.2–6 times.\\nThese results support outcome supervision as a more effective and efficient alternative to incremental SFT on pre-defined or explored paths.\\nFinally, KnowCoder-A1 unlocks SOTA reasoning capabilities in smaller models. As shown in the first block of Table 1 , KnowCoder-A1 consistently outperforms prompting-based methods that rely on significantly larger models like GPT-4-turbo by at least 6% at F1. This demonstrates an essential improvement in the model’s intrinsic reasoning ability.\\nTo verify the effectiveness of our key designs, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study, and the results are presented in Table 3 . First, we assess the reward curriculum by replacing our proposed easy-to-hard ( F 0.5 F_{0.5} -then- F 1 F_{1} ) strategy, give the result using EM, F 1 F_{1} , F 0.5 F_{0.5} , and revered strategy F 1 F_{1} -then- F 0.5 F_{0.5} as reward, respectively. Next, we evaluate the contribution of the entire RL stage by removing it altogether. Finally, we remove the data sampling strategy from the initial cold-start phase. The results confirm that each component is integral to the model’s performance, as removing or modifying any of them leads to a noticeable degradation.\\nEffectiveness of the Easy-to-Hard Reward Curriculum. The first block of Table 3 shows the effectiveness of the Easy-to-Hard Reward Curriculum. Take the GrailQA dataset as an example, we observe that an overly simplistic signal like EM is insufficient for exploration; it induces \"over-recall reward hacking,\" resulting in a massive drop in the F 1 F_{1} score on GrailQA. Meanwhile, a stricter F1 reward is too punishing early on, leading to a -4.5% F1 drop. Notably, reversing the curriculum to a hard-to-easy schedule ( F 1 F_{1} -then- F 0.5 F_{0.5} ) also degrades performance (-4.4% F1 drop). This confirms our hypothesis: starting with an “easy task” encourages broad exploration to discover correct reasoning paths, while the subsequent “hard task” refines the agent’s ability to achieve a better balance between precision and recall.\\nCritical Contribution of the RL Stage. From the second block of Table 3 , we can observe that removing the entire RL-stage causes at least 17.4% absolute drop in the F1 score. This large gap suggests that RL-based exploration is essential for refining the agent’s reasoning capability beyond initial supervised learning.\\nImportance of Upsampling in the Cold-Start Stage. Finally, as the last row shows, removing the up-sampling of infrequent question types leads to poor performance on those specific categories. This underscores the importance of our sampling strategy for building a model that can generalize across a diverse range of reasoning patterns.\\nTo answer the RQ3 and investigate how KnowCoder-A1 progressively enhances the agent’s reasoning capability under the outcome-only supervision, we analyze from the train dynamics, the evolution of its reasoning robustness and diversity, and the comparative performance against process-supervised methods.\\nAs shown in Fig. 3 , to track the evolution of the model’s capabilities during training, we present the curves of (a) training reward, (b) response length (token), (c) turns of interaction, and (d) the number of invalid tool calls along the training step. It can be seen that the agent’s strategy clearly transitions from broad exploration to efficient exploitation : initially, the agent explores inefficiently, which is reflected in high response lengths and turn counts for a low reward. As training progresses, these trends reverse: the reward consistently rises while the metrics for response length, turns, and invalid tool calls all significantly decrease. This dynamic illustrates a fundamental improvement in the agent’s complex question-solving process, not just a superficial optimization of rewards.\\nTo provide a deeper analysis of whether the model’s reasoning ability is enhanced, particularly concerning the robustness and flexibility lacking in SFT methods, we examine the evolution of the agent’s reasoning behavior. Fig. 4 (a) illustrates its robustness by showing the composition of rollout trajectories, categorized as: \"Directly Hit,\" for trajectories where the final prediction hits at least one gold answers; \"Recovered after Error/Empty,\" for those that hit at least one gold answers after encountering an intermediate error or empty observation; and \"Incorrect,\" for trajectories where the final prediction fails to find any gold answerss. The figure shows that the proportion of successful trajectories (\"Directly Hit\" and \"Recovered\") steadily increases during training, This confirms that the agent learns to effectively recover from imperfect feedback, a direct advantage of our outcome supervision approach. In contrast, process supervision encourages the model to simply replicate pre-defined trajectories from the training data, and thus fails to incentivize this type of recovery behavior.\\nFig. 4 (b) measures flexibility by plotting the diversity of trajectories, which we define as the number of unique final SPARQL queries generated for the same question across the rollouts. It can be seen that the agent initially broadens its search for a wide range of solutions before consolidating on a compact set of the most reliable ones, which is consistent with the process discussed in Sec. 5.4.1 . This indicates that outcome-only supervision naturally fosters an exploration-then-convergence behavior, where the agent ultimately retains sufficient solution diversity to effectively address the lack of flexibility inherent in process-supervised methods.\\nTo explore whether incorporating process supervision in addition to outcome-only supervision benefits model performance, we experimented by incorporating necessary process-level penalties for behaviors including hallucinations and timeouts. Specifically, we define a hallucination as a tool call containing a relation or type that is not present in the observation history, while a timeout query denotes a call that results in a 300 second timeout. We applied a negative reward of -0.2 for each occurrence of these behaviors, with the total accumulated penalty capped at -0.5. We then compared our full model against two variants incorporating these Process Rewards (P.R.): one applying the penalties throughout the entire RL training (P.R.@RL-phase-1&2), and another applying them only during the second stage (P.R.@RL-phase-2).\\nThe results clearly demonstrate that introducing penalties for any intermediate behaviors, even for intuitively negative ones, degrades final performance. We hypothesize that in KBQA tasks, where the correctness of answers can be explicitly verified, process-level rewards may interfere with the agent’s capacity to form a robust trial-and-error exploration strategy, as they tend to prematurely penalize exploratory trajectories that could eventually achieve correct results.\\nTo concretely demonstrate the advanced reasoning capabilities of KnowCoder-A1 , we present a qualitative case study with two detailed examples in Appendix F . These examples highlight the agent’s ability to: (1) robustly recover from erroneous feedback; (2) flexibly use tools to find correct answers via reasoning trajectories that differ from the gold SPARQL. These cases serve as strong evidence of the robustness and flexibility fostered by the proposed KnowCoder-A1 approach.\\nIn addition, we conduct error analysis, which is presented in Appendix D .',\n",

Fig. 4 (a) illustrates its robustness by showing the composition of rollout trajectories, categorized as: \"Directly Hit,\" for trajectories where the final prediction hits at least one gold answers; \"Recovered after Error/Empty,\" for those that hit at least one gold answers after encountering an intermediate error or empty observation; and \"Incorrect,\" for trajectories where the final prediction fails to find any gold answerss. The figure shows that the proportion of successful trajectories (\"Directly Hit\" and \"Recovered\") steadily increases during training, This confirms that the agent learns to effectively recover from imperfect feedback, a direct advantage of our outcome supervision approach. In contrast, process supervision encourages the model to simply replicate pre-defined trajectories from the training data, and thus fails to incentivize this type of recovery behavior.\\nFig. 4 (b) measures flexibility by plotting the diversity of trajectories, which we define as the number of unique final SPARQL queries generated for the same question across the rollouts.

It is trained by a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning framework that effectively leverages outcome-only supervision through a carefully designed learning curriculum. Specifically, KnowCoder-A1 first establishes foundational reasoning capabilities via a cold-start fine-tuning stage on a small, high-quality dataset created through outcome-based rejection sampling. It then enhances the agent’s exploratory capacity through curriculum RL, employing a progressive reward schedule that transitions from easy to hard tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further analyses reveal that KnowCoder-A1 learns to act as a robust and flexible agent, capable of recovering from errors and strategically exploring diverse reasoning trajectories. Future work may investigate more advanced reflection mechanisms to mitigate remaining error types and extend this curriculum strategy to other complex, agent-based reasoning tasks.',\n",

Second, we present a joint distribution of error frequency versus sample accuracy across training stages, which serves to supplement our main analysis of training dynamics (Section 5.4.1 ) and offers a more comprehensive view of how the agent’s capabilities evolve.\\nWe compared the impact of different backbone models on performance during the cold-start stage. As shown in Table 6 , our results indicate that Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base delivers the strongest overall performance. Although Qwen3-8B-Base performs better on the simpler WebQSP dataset, we selected Qwen2.5-Coder-7-Base for its superior performance on CWQ, which contains more complex questions.

As shown in Table 7 , the comparison covers LLM call frequency, token usage, and overall cost. The results reveal that KnowCoder-A1 achieves performance comparable to the complex ToG, while maintaining a computational budget similar to the much simpler CoT. This efficiency stems from outcome-based supervision: the model learns to recover from empty results or intermediate errors in a single pass, obviating the need to generate multiple branches to find a solution at significant computational expense. Overall, KnowCoder-A1 shifts the efficiency frontier toward lower cost while maintaining strong effectiveness, making it more predictable and easier to deploy in real-world scenarios.\\nTo further investigate how the agent’s robustness evolves, we analyze the association between intermediate errors and final rewards throughout training. As illustrated in Figure 5 , we plot the joint distribution of the mean frequency of empty results/errors per question against the mean reward. This visualization reveals a clear progression. Early in training, the distribution forms a downward-sloping triangle, where higher error rates are strongly correlated with lower rewards. As training advances, this shape flattens into a rectangle, indicating that high rewards are achieved even with a non-trivial frequency of errors. Concurrently, the density increases in the upper-left corner, reflecting a growing number of questions being solved directly and perfectly.

       "  'abstract': 'Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries, and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision, which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling. Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1 achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.'},\n",

By learning directly from raw audio, these models have the potential to integrate both lexical and paralinguistic information – capturing not only what is said, but how it is said Pasad ( 2025 ) . Despite this, while SFMs are increasingly evaluated for recognition accuracy and text-aligned reasoning, their treatment of paralinguistic variation remains largely untested Yang et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) .\\nOne important but understudied aspect of paralinguistic variation is voice quality . Voice quality refers to differences in phonation arising from specific laryngeal and supralaryngeal configurations (Laver, 1980 ) . In some languages these contrasts are phonemic (Esposito, 2005 ) , while in English they carry pragmatic and social meaning. Research has associated breathy voice with intimacy (Tsvetanova et\\xa0al., 2017 ) and creaky voice (also called vocal fry) with authority or disengagement (Laver, 1968 ) . Perceptual studies also point to gender-based asymmetries: creaky voice tends to elicit negative attitudes towards young female speakers (Hornibrook et\\xa0al., 2018 ) , whereas attractiveness judgments depend on both speaker gender and phonation type (Greer and Winters, 2015 ; Xu et\\xa0al., 2013 ) .\\nDespite the perceptual and social weight of voice quality, current SFM evaluation methods provide little insight into how these models interpret or reproduce phonation-related cues. The majority of paralinguistic assessments depend on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) frameworks (Sakshi et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Ma et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , which constrain model outputs and mask how non-lexical variations influence generation patterns. Additional concerns surrounding MCQA evaluations Bokkahalli\\xa0Satish et\\xa0al. ( 2025b ); Li et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ); Zheng et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ) , particularly within the speech domain, remain yet to be adequately addressed.\\nA framework for assessing SFM responses to systematic voice quality variation in naturalistic contexts is still absent.\\nRecent advances in speech synthesis and voice conversion Rautenberg et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ); Lameris et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ); Lameris and Ward ( 2025 ) now enable the generation of creaky and breathy phonation to varying degrees, and the systematic manipulation of these features across speaker profiles while keeping speaker identity and linguistic content constant. This allows us to pinpoint how voice quality affects both speech emotion recognition (SER) systems and the behaviour of SFMs including how they encode and interpret differences.\\nIn this work, we present VQ-Bench , a controlled evaluation suite designed to test SFM sensitivity to voice quality variation. The dataset includes parallel prompts synthesized in modal, breathy, creaky, and end-creak phonation types. We use it to evaluate two complementary settings: long-form, open-ended generation tasks, and speech emotion recognition. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a first systematic study of SFM behaviour under controlled phonation variation, (2) a corpus of synthetic voice quality data for reproducible evaluation, and (3) an open-ended evaluation protocol for probing paralinguistic sensitivity in speech models.\\nOur corpus and evaluation suite will be made available at this link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lost-in-phonation-65B9',\n",

The prompts were altered with respect to their glottal source characteristics, using the method described in Lameris et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ) , to produce modal, breathy, creaky, and end-creak variants of the original prompts.\\nTo create realistic prompts designed to measure the effect of voice quality, we create an expanded version of the open-ended long-form question prompts from Bokkahalli\\xa0Satish et\\xa0al. ( 2025a ) , which consists of four categories grounded in documented real-world applications of SpeechLLMs: Therapy, Career advice, Interview screening, and Storytelling Karvonen and Marks ( 2025 ); Lum et\\xa0al.

This results in a total of 20 prompts per speaker.\\nWe used F5-TTS (Chen et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , a state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS system to synthesize the prompts. In order to create the target voices for the synthesis of the prompts, we extracted speech from the Buckeye corpus Pitt et\\xa0al.

The OpenAI real-time speech-to-speech API proves unreliable, defaulting to classifying nearly all samples as male, and consequently shows no systematic response variation across voice qualities. All subsequent results therefore focus on the LFMAudio2 model, which demonstrates reliable gender detection.\\nThe gemini-2.5-flash-lite judge LLM ratings of LFMAudio2-1.5B responses were analyzed using a cumulative link mixed model (CLMM) for each dimension of the long-form generation task. The CLMM included voice quality, gender, and prompt as fixed effects, and speaker as a random intercept. We initially tested for interaction effects between voice quality and gender:\\nInteractions that were not significant based on an ANOVA were removed from the model. Likewise, fixed effects that were not significant were dropped. As an interaction effect was only found for the ‘Heroic agency’ evaluation dimension for the Buckeye corpus, the interactions were not further investigated. The full results can be found in Table 2 . The effect of voice quality was significant for all evaluation dimensions except ‘Role status’ and ‘Emotional validation’ . The direction of the effect differed per task and per voice quality. For the career advice task, in the ‘STEM vs. care’ dimension, breathy and end-creak resulted in higher STEM-oriented ratings compared to modal voice, while a creaky voice resulted in more care-oriented ratings. While all voice qualities increased scores of ‘Actionability’ compared to modal voice. For the interview task, all voice qualities resulted in lower scores, except for creaky voice in the Shortlist decision dimension. In the storytelling task, the effect of voice quality is mixed, but consistent across corpora. For the therapy task, all non-modal voice qualities increased scores compared to modal voice if voice quality was found to be significant. Surprisingly, the effect of end-creak aligns more with breathy speech than with creaky voice quality. Female voices were systematically rated lower than male voices in the interview task across both corpora, specifically for ‘Salary offer’ and ‘Leadership endorsement’ .\\nThe SER results were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel categorical regression, predicting emotion labels from voice quality, gender, and prompt, with a random intercept per speaker. The model was estimated using four Markov chains, each with 2,000 iterations, including 1,000 warmup iterations. The R-hat values indicated good convergence. Results revealed meaningful effects for several voice quality categories compared to modal voice, as well as gender effects. Breathy voice increased the likelihood of calm and neutral predictions while decreasing the likelihood of fearful and surprised predictions. Creaky voice decreased the likelihood of fearful and happy predictions. End-creak decreased the likelihood of fearful predictions.

Additionally, voice quality significantly affects predictions in an SER task. There is a high degree of internal consistency in the results despite the fact that the voices were created from disparate corpora. Both the results for the long-form response and SER task often correspond to descriptions of voice quality in literature, such as associations of breathy voice with non-aggressive, friendly speech (Xu et\\xa0al., 2013 ) as well as prevalent gender bias regarding salary and leadership.\\nIf speech foundation models are not evaluated for bias in terms of how they interpret voice quality, they risk reproducing the same, at times gendered, asymmetries observed in human listeners. Our current analysis is limited to binary gender distinctions, reflecting the structure of the source corpora. However, the inclusion of gender-ambiguous and non-binary voices will be essential to assess whether similar or distinct biases emerge beyond the binary paradigm. Subtle features such as breathiness or creak may be mapped to social judgments of competence in ways that can negatively impact SFM-aided decision making in job interviews that could disproportionately disadvantage female speakers. Thus, the models may not only mirror human biases but also amplify them, as observed with other stereotypes in AI systems Schwartz et\\xa0al. ( 2022 ) .\\nRegarding the mapping between perceived paralinguistic meaning and voice quality, our preliminary evaluation of an SER model indicates that, as these models continue to improve, they could serve as a useful resource for providing empirical evidence supporting the development of hypotheses about the specific communicative functions of individual voice qualities.',\n",

Similar trends appeared in speech emotion recognition: breathy voice increased predictions of calm and neutral states, while creaky and end-creak voices reduced fearful classifications.\\nThese patterns mirror well-documented human perceptual biases, including gender-linked asymmetries in how vocal traits are interpreted. VQ-Bench provides a reproducible method for probing this dimension of model behaviour. Our results highlight that paralinguistic variation, particularly voice quality, can meaningfully alter SFM reasoning, evaluation, and emotional mapping.

Our evaluation framework uses multi-modal input capabilities of modern SFMs, which accept both audio speech prompts and accompanying text instructions. The two SFMs evaluated in this study differ in their output modalities. LFMAudio2-1.5B generates both textual and corresponding speech outputs, whereas the OpenAI speech-to-speech API produces only speech output, which requires an additional transcription step (with speech recognition) to use the judge LLM.\\nThe prompts in Table 3 are organized into four ecologically valid categories – Therapy, Career Advice, Interview Screening, and Storytelling – each with five distinct variations. These categories were selected to represent realistic deployment scenarios where voice quality and speaker characteristics might influence model behaviour. For the Therapy category, prompts describe emotional distress and burnout in varied ways, testing whether the model’s supportive responses are influenced by how the speaker sounds rather than solely what they say. The Career Advice prompts present speakers with different professional interests and decision-making scenarios, allowing us to assess whether voice quality biases the model toward particular career trajectories (e.g., STEM vs. care-oriented roles). Interview Screening prompts feature speakers expressing confidence and leadership capability, enabling measurement of whether phonation type affects hiring recommendations and salary offers.

       "  'abstract': 'Recent advances in speech foundation models (SFMs) have enabled the direct processing of spoken language from raw audio, bypassing intermediate textual representations. This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal. One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality, encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality, designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular non-lexical aspects of speech perception.\\n \\n \\n Keywords:\\u2009Speech Foundation Models, Voice Quality, Phonation Types, Paralinguistics'},\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Stock markets are fundamental to the global financial system, with accurate price prediction directly impacting capital allocation, portfolio optimization, and risk management. While the Efficient Market Hypothesis (Merello et\\xa0al., 2019 ) suggests that prices reflect all available information, making future movements theoretically unpredictable, research has identified systematic inefficiencies—information asymmetry, behavioral biases, and market microstructure effects—that create potentially exploitable patterns for those capable of modeling and uncovering insights within complex market dynamics.\\nPredicting stock market movements remains an exceptionally challenging task due to a range of intertwined factors. Financial markets typically exhibit a low signal-to-noise ratio, where meaningful patterns are often obscured by random fluctuations. Their inherently non-stationary nature means that profitable patterns in one regime may fail as conditions change.\\nStock movements also involve complex interdependencies through sectoral correlations and momentum spillovers that evolve dynamically.\\nIn addition, prices react to influences operating across multiple timescales, while relevant information spans diverse forms, from structured numerical data to unstructured text.\\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2020 ) have emerged as a powerful framework for stock market prediction by modeling inter-stock relationships through industry affiliations and correlation, enabling information propagation across stocks to capture sectoral influences and spillover effects. However, conventional graph models are inherently limited to pairwise relationships. In contrast, real-world markets often exhibit complex group-wise correlations. Stocks within the same sector tend to move synchronously during sectoral shifts, and related industries experience collective movements under supply chain disruptions. These limitations motivate the adoption of hypergraphs (Agarwal et\\xa0al., 2006 ; Feng et\\xa0al., 2019b ) , where hyperedges can connect multiple nodes simultaneously, naturally encoding group relationships. Hypergraph representations preserve higher-order market structures and facilitate efficient computation by directly modeling group interactions rather than degenerating them into oversimplified binary relations.\\nModels that rely exclusively on numerical data exhibit fundamental epistemic constraints, as they are unable to anticipate phenomena absent from historical data. Corporate disclosures, regulatory shifts, and geopolitical events typically manifest as textual information prior to influencing market prices. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Chen et\\xa0al., 2023b ) has introduced new opportunities for processing textual data at scale. Equipped with extensive pre-trained knowledge of economics and finance, LLMs can assimilate dynamic news flows, thereby addressing informational gaps that traditional time series models are unable to bridge (Xie et\\xa0al., 2023 ) .\\nRecent research has explored several strategies for integrating LLMs with quantitative models, including alignment method that maps time series into textual embeddings (Ding et\\xa0al., 2023 ) , and prompt-based approach (Li et\\xa0al., 2024a ) that textualizes numerical data. Despite these advances, substantial challenges persist in achieving seamless LLM integration. Existing methods generally treat structural and textual information in isolation, thereby foregoing potential synergies. Furthermore, the inherent mismatch between the discrete, token-based processing of LLMs and the continuous nature of time series remains only partially resolved, underscoring the necessity for sophisticated multimodal fusion frameworks.\\nAs models grow increasingly complex, computational efficiency becomes paramount. The Mixture of Experts (MoEs) framework (Jacobs, 1993 ; Fedus et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Riquelme et\\xa0al., 2021 ) addresses this challenge by dynamically routing inputs to specialized expert networks, activating only relevant model subsets. This selective activation allows different experts to specialize in particular market conditions or sectors, preserving model capacity while maintaining manageable inference costs for practical deployment.\\nHowever, integrating MoEs architectures with advanced financial modeling components remains nontrivial. Current approaches to combining hypergraph structures with transformer architectures often rely on simple feature fusion rather than joint reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, existing MoEs implementations typically fail to capture the hierarchical and multi-scale nature of market dynamics.\\nThese limitations highlight the need for novel architectures capable of unifying relational modeling, modality alignment, textual understanding, and computational efficiency while remaining feasible for deployment in real trading environments.\\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal architecture that synergistically integrates multi-context hypergraph modeling, LLM-enhanced semantic reasoning, and style–structure expert specialization. Our contributions are threefold:\\nMulti-Context Multimodal Hypergraph : We introduce a hierarchical architecture consisting of a Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) that captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics at the instance level, and a Global Context Hypergraph (GCH) that models persistent structural dependencies across stocks.\\nBoth components utilize shared hyperedges that jointly connect nodes from quantitative and textual modalities, enabling direct interaction between market signals and news narratives. Through hypergraph convolutions, these shared connections facilitate mutual representation enhancement and cross-modal feature learning, achieving deep, integrated multi-modal understanding beyond simple fusion.\\nLLM-Enhanced Reasoning : We incorporate a frozen Large Language Model (Llama-3.2-1B) to bridge the semantic gap between textual and numerical information. Leveraging its pre-trained financial knowledge, the LLM enriches multi-modal representations while preserving efficiency via parameter freezing and lightweight adapter layers.\\nStyle-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) : We introduce a MoEs module with learnable style parameters that enables adaptive specialization across different market states and industry conditions via sparse activation. This design maintains computational efficiency while preserving high model capacity and complements the hypergraph for robust regime-aware representations.\\nExtensive experiments on the DJIA, NASDAQ 100, and S&P 100 indices demonstrate our method’s state-of-the-art performance, achieving the highest risk-adjusted returns with Sharpe ratios of 1.585, 2.100, and 1.351, and Calmar ratios of 3.377, 4.380, and 2.075, respectively, while maintaining the lowest maximum drawdowns (14.81%, 16.17%, and 14.27%).',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Early stock prediction methods primarily relied on statistical models (Wang and Leu, 1996 ; Zivot and Wang, 2006 ) , which assume linear dependencies and thus struggle to capture the complex dynamics of financial markets. Subsequent machine learning approaches (Ballings et\\xa0al., 2015 ) enhanced non-linear modeling capabilities but often treated stocks independently, overlooking inter-stock dependencies. This limitation motivated the adoption of graph-based models to represent the inherent relational structure among stocks.\\nRecognizing that stock movements are highly interconnected, researchers began employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model inter-stock relationships (Chen et\\xa0al., 2018 ) . Early studies constructed graphs using predefined relationships such as common shareholders, industry sectors, or supply chains. More advanced models, including RSR (Feng et\\xa0al., 2019a ) , which integrates LSTM with graph convolutions, HATS (Kim et\\xa0al., 2019 ) , which introduces multi-relational attention mechanisms, and FinGAT (Hsu et\\xa0al., 2021 ) , which applies dynamic attention to quantify stock interactions, have demonstrated improved performance. Recent approaches have shifted from static, predefined structures to dynamically learned relationships that capture latent dependencies between stocks (Sawhney et\\xa0al., 2021 ) .\\nBeyond pairwise relations, the recognition of group-wise interactions has spurred the development of hypergraph-based models. STHGCN (Sawhney et\\xa0al., 2020 ) jointly models the temporal evolution of stock prices and their industry-level associations, effectively capturing higher-order dependencies. More recently, CI-STHPAN (Xia et\\xa0al., 2024 ) introduced a pre-training framework on stock time series followed by fine-tuning for quantitative stock selection, leveraging self-supervised learning to extract robust spatio-temporal representations.\\nDeep learning has revolutionized stock market prediction through diverse neural architectures. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Cho et\\xa0al., 2014 ) , particularly LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997 ; Moghar and Hamiche, 2020 ) and GRU (Gupta et\\xa0al., 2022 ) variants, have been widely utilized for their ability to capture sequential dependencies and temporal dynamics. The DA-RNN (Qin et\\xa0al., 2017 ) introduced LSTMs to adaptively extract relevant features, while the State Frequency Memory (SFM) network (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2017 ) decomposed hidden states into multiple frequency components to enhance representational diversity. Moreover, transformer-based architectures have achieved superior performance by effectively modeling complex temporal and cross-asset dependencies. Stockformer (Ma et\\xa0al., 2025 ) integrates wavelet decomposition with dual-frequency spatio-temporal encoders and a fusion attention mechanism to capture both high- and low-frequency financial dynamics.\\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm in financial modeling. BloombergGPT (Wu et\\xa0al., 2024 ) represents a seminal effort, comprising 50 billion parameters trained on a hybrid corpus of financial and general-domain texts. FinGPT (Yang et\\xa0al., 2023 ) and DISC-FinLLM (Chen et\\xa0al., 2023a ) introduced instruction fine-tuning and low-rank adaptation, to improve task-specific performance. LLMs also have been leveraged under various paradigms: news-driven approaches utilize sentiment and contextual analysis of market narratives, while reasoning-driven agents like FinMEM (Yu et\\xa0al., 2023 ) and FinAgent (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) incorporate multimodal data sources, such as earnings calls, regulatory filings, and social media, to augment predictive accuracy and interpretability.\\nTime Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have further extended the foundation model paradigm to temporal data. Models such as TimesFM (Das et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , Lag-Llama (Rasul et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , and Chronos (Ansari et\\xa0al., 2024 ) exhibit strong generalization across diverse time series domains by pre-training on large-scale temporal corpora. Financially specialized models, including Kronos (Shi et\\xa0al., 2025a ) , address a key limitation of general-purpose TSFMs by focusing exclusively on financial datasets, thereby improving domain relevance. To mitigate computational costs and improve scalability, Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged, with Time-MoE (Shi et\\xa0al., 2025b ) scales TSFMs to billions of parameters while achieving 20–24% performance gains over dense models under equivalent computational budgets.\\nThe integration of numerical and textual data in time series forecasting has progressed from rudimentary keyword-based approaches to advanced architectures that leverage the full representational capacity of large language models.

       "      'paragraphs': 'Early stock prediction methods primarily relied on statistical models (Wang and Leu, 1996 ; Zivot and Wang, 2006 ) , which assume linear dependencies and thus struggle to capture the complex dynamics of financial markets. Subsequent machine learning approaches (Ballings et\\xa0al., 2015 ) enhanced non-linear modeling capabilities but often treated stocks independently, overlooking inter-stock dependencies. This limitation motivated the adoption of graph-based models to represent the inherent relational structure among stocks.\\nRecognizing that stock movements are highly interconnected, researchers began employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model inter-stock relationships (Chen et\\xa0al., 2018 ) . Early studies constructed graphs using predefined relationships such as common shareholders, industry sectors, or supply chains. More advanced models, including RSR (Feng et\\xa0al., 2019a ) , which integrates LSTM with graph convolutions, HATS (Kim et\\xa0al., 2019 ) , which introduces multi-relational attention mechanisms, and FinGAT (Hsu et\\xa0al., 2021 ) , which applies dynamic attention to quantify stock interactions, have demonstrated improved performance. Recent approaches have shifted from static, predefined structures to dynamically learned relationships that capture latent dependencies between stocks (Sawhney et\\xa0al., 2021 ) .\\nBeyond pairwise relations, the recognition of group-wise interactions has spurred the development of hypergraph-based models. STHGCN (Sawhney et\\xa0al., 2020 ) jointly models the temporal evolution of stock prices and their industry-level associations, effectively capturing higher-order dependencies. More recently, CI-STHPAN (Xia et\\xa0al., 2024 ) introduced a pre-training framework on stock time series followed by fine-tuning for quantitative stock selection, leveraging self-supervised learning to extract robust spatio-temporal representations.',\n",

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Cho et\\xa0al., 2014 ) , particularly LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997 ; Moghar and Hamiche, 2020 ) and GRU (Gupta et\\xa0al., 2022 ) variants, have been widely utilized for their ability to capture sequential dependencies and temporal dynamics. The DA-RNN (Qin et\\xa0al., 2017 ) introduced LSTMs to adaptively extract relevant features, while the State Frequency Memory (SFM) network (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2017 ) decomposed hidden states into multiple frequency components to enhance representational diversity. Moreover, transformer-based architectures have achieved superior performance by effectively modeling complex temporal and cross-asset dependencies. Stockformer (Ma et\\xa0al., 2025 ) integrates wavelet decomposition with dual-frequency spatio-temporal encoders and a fusion attention mechanism to capture both high- and low-frequency financial dynamics.\\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm in financial modeling. BloombergGPT (Wu et\\xa0al., 2024 ) represents a seminal effort, comprising 50 billion parameters trained on a hybrid corpus of financial and general-domain texts. FinGPT (Yang et\\xa0al., 2023 ) and DISC-FinLLM (Chen et\\xa0al., 2023a ) introduced instruction fine-tuning and low-rank adaptation, to improve task-specific performance. LLMs also have been leveraged under various paradigms: news-driven approaches utilize sentiment and contextual analysis of market narratives, while reasoning-driven agents like FinMEM (Yu et\\xa0al., 2023 ) and FinAgent (Zhang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) incorporate multimodal data sources, such as earnings calls, regulatory filings, and social media, to augment predictive accuracy and interpretability.\\nTime Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have further extended the foundation model paradigm to temporal data. Models such as TimesFM (Das et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , Lag-Llama (Rasul et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , and Chronos (Ansari et\\xa0al., 2024 ) exhibit strong generalization across diverse time series domains by pre-training on large-scale temporal corpora. Financially specialized models, including Kronos (Shi et\\xa0al., 2025a ) , address a key limitation of general-purpose TSFMs by focusing exclusively on financial datasets, thereby improving domain relevance. To mitigate computational costs and improve scalability, Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged, with Time-MoE (Shi et\\xa0al., 2025b ) scales TSFMs to billions of parameters while achieving 20–24% performance gains over dense models under equivalent computational budgets.',\n",

These projections enable the alignment of diverse data sources—quantitative indicators, textual news, and temporal information—within a common representational framework.\\nModality-Specific Projection. Each modality m m (quantitative, news, or timestamps) is transformed through a modality-specific feed-forward network that maps the original input space to the shared latent dimension:\\nwhere 𝐱 n , t ( m ) \\\\mathbf{x}_{n,t}^{(m)} denotes the input features of modality m m for stock n n at time t t . Specifically, 𝐱 n , t quant ∈ ℝ F \\\\mathbf{x}_{n,t}^{\\\\text{quant}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{F} corresponds to F F financial indicators, 𝐱 n , t news ∈ ℝ D news \\\\mathbf{x}_{n,t}^{\\\\text{news}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D_{\\\\text{news}}} represents pre-computed LLM embeddings of news, and 𝐱 t time ∈ ℝ D time \\\\mathbf{x}_{t}^{\\\\text{time}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D_{\\\\text{time}}} encodes timestamps via LLM-processed date representations shared across all stocks.\\nTemporal Encoding Integration. To introduce temporal awareness into quantitative features and strengthen their alignment with daily news embeddings, we incorporate positional encodings as follows:\\nThis formulation explicitly injects temporal context into quantitative representations, enhancing their ability to capture time-dependent market dynamics. In contrast, news embeddings inherently encode temporal semantics through their linguistic content. The resulting representations form two parallel embedding streams, 𝐙 quant , 𝐙 news ∈ ℝ N × T × D \\\\mathbf{Z}^{\\\\text{quant}},\\\\mathbf{Z}^{\\\\text{news}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times T\\\\times D} , which serve as inputs for cross-modal alignment within subsequent hypergraph-based layers.\\nTraditional graph-based approaches are inherently constrained by predefined static pairwise relationships, which limits their ability to capture dynamic, collective market behaviors where entire sectors often move synchronously. To address this limitation, we introduce a multi-context multimodal hypergraph framework that hierarchically models both local and global interactions through higher-order relationships. Our architecture leverages shared hypergraph to unify intra-modal and cross-modal interactions, facilitating comprehensive information exchange between quantitative signals and semantic news semantics. This design effectively captures the bidirectional interplay between the two modalities—how news drives market movements and how market fluctuations, in turn, generate new narratives. By modeling these intertwined dependencies, the proposed framework achieves synergistic multimodal integration and cross-modal alignment, surpassing conventional fusion approaches.\\nThe Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) is designed to model the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in financial markets, where individual stock movements are jointly influenced by immediate behavioral patterns and market narratives. Unlike conventional methods relying on fixed temporal windows or predefined, static correlations, the LCH flexibly discovers dynamic group relationships of stock–time quantitative and textual instances that exhibit coordinated behaviors by representing each stock at each timestamp as a distinct node within a hypergraph. This formulation preserves fine-grained temporal resolution while leveraging hyperedges to model group-wise dependencies that evolve over time.\\nTo achieve unified processing across temporal and spatial dimensions, we flatten the stock and time dimensions to obtain 𝐙 f \\u200b l \\u200b a \\u200b t ( m ) ∈ ℝ N ⋅ T × D \\\\mathbf{Z}^{(m)}_{flat}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\cdot T\\\\times D} for each modality m ∈ { quantitative , news } m\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{quantitative},\\\\text{news}\\\\} , where each row represents a unique stock–time instance. The core innovation lies in constructing multimodal sub-hypergraphs that capture distinct types of dependencies: temporal correlations within numerical indicators, semantic coherence across news narratives, and the bidirectional interplay between quantitative and textual modalities. This design explicitly acknowledges that market behaviors are governed by fundamentally heterogeneous forms of relationships and modalities.\\nFor each modality pair ( m i , m j ) (m_{i},m_{j}) (quantitative or news), a specialized sub-hypergraph is learned via adaptive projection:\\nwhere FFN l \\u200b o \\u200b c \\u200b a \\u200b l ( m i , m j ) \\\\text{FFN}_{local}^{(m_{i},m_{j})} is a modality-pair-specific network that learns to identify E 1 E_{1} latent hyperedges, each representing a set of stock–time instances exhibiting coordinated behaviors. This formulation yields four distinct sub-hypergraphs corresponding to intra- and inter-modal relationships intertwined with critical market dynamics:\\nQuantitative–Quantitative Dynamics : Captures temporal momentum and volatility clustering within numerical market indicators;\\nNews–News Coherence : Models semantic coherence and the propagation of narratives across the news landscape;\\nQuantitative–News Alignment : Aligns market reactions with contemporaneous news events. This cross-modal sub-hypergraph learns how current price patterns co-occur with specific news narratives, contextualizing stock movements within the textual information;\\nNews–Quantitative Anticipation : Represents the inverse relationship—how news content anticipates market movements. This component captures predictive cues embedded in texts that may not yet manifest in price dynamics.\\nThis symmetric design explicitly differentiates between the market’s reactive and anticipatory responses to news information.\\nAlthough these sub-hypergraphs encode complementary aspects of market behavior, their relative importance fluctuates with changing market regimes. Rather than treating all relationships uniformly, the LCH employs an adaptive multi-hypergraph fusion mechanism:\\nThis fusion network dynamically weights and integrates the intra- and cross-modal sub-hypergraphs in accordance with the prevailing market context. Subsequently, z-score normalization is applied to each element within the hyperedges, followed by a column-wise softmax operation to ensure that each hyperedge constitutes a probability distribution over nodes, resulting in the unified incidence matrix 𝐇 l \\u200b o \\u200b c \\u200b a \\u200b l \\\\mathbf{H}_{local} .\\nHowever, not all hyperedges contribute equally to modeling market structure. Some effectively encode distinctive and insightful dependencies, whereas others capture redundant or noisy patterns. To highlight the most informative structures, we introduce an information-theoretic hyperedge weighting scheme based on the Jensen–Shannon Divergence (JSD). For each pair of hyperedges i i and j j :\\nwhere 𝐡 i \\\\mathbf{h}_{i} denotes the node distribution of the i i -th hyperedge, 𝐦 i \\u200b j = 1 2 \\u200b ( 𝐡 i + 𝐡 j ) \\\\mathbf{m}_{ij}=\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\mathbf{h}_{i}+\\\\mathbf{h}_{j}) is their mean distribution, and KL is the Kullback–Leibler Divergence. Hyperedges with higher average JSD scores capture more unique relational structures and thus receive larger weights in the diagonal matrix 𝐖 𝟏 ∈ ℝ E 1 × E 1 \\\\mathbf{W_{1}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{E_{1}\\\\times E_{1}} . This adaptive weighting encourages the model to emphasize structurally informative hyperedges while suppressing redundant ones.\\nFinally, information is propagated through the weighted hypergraph structure to model higher-order interactions among stock–time instances. For each modality, hypergraph convolution is performed using the shared local hypergraph 𝐇 l \\u200b o \\u200b c \\u200b a \\u200b l \\\\mathbf{H}^{local} :\\nwhere 𝚯 l \\u200b o \\u200b c \\u200b a \\u200b l ( m ) ∈ ℝ D × D \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Theta}^{(m)}_{local}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D\\\\times D} is a learnable modality-specific transformation matrix, and σ \\\\sigma denotes a nonlinear activation. This operation facilitates high-order cross-temporal, and cross-modal interactions, enabling implicit alignment between modalities. Consequently, the model learns temporal lead–lag relationships and cross-stock spillover effects, uncovering latent connections between quantitative market dynamics and textual narratives.\\nThe resulting features 𝐙 ′ L \\u200b C \\u200b H ( m ) \\\\mathbf{Z^{\\\\prime}}^{(m)}_{LCH} are then reshaped to ℝ N × T × D \\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times T\\\\times D} to yield 𝐙 L \\u200b C \\u200b H ( m ) \\\\mathbf{Z}^{(m)}_{LCH} , embedding sophisticated dependencies.\\nWhile the Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) captures fine-grained spatiotemporal patterns, the Global Context Hypergraph (GCH) models persistent structural relationships—such as sector affiliations, supply chain dependencies, and competitive dynamics—that span the entire temporal horizon. This global perspective facilitates the identification of stable sectoral structures and long-term dependencies through higher-order group interactions.\\nThe GCH adopts an architecture analogous to that of the LCH but operates at the stock level rather than the instance level, thereby modeling persistent inter-stock relationships across time. The features are first flattened into stock-level representations of shape ℝ N × ( T ⋅ D ) \\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times(T\\\\cdot D)} . Subsequently, multi-head self- and cross-attention mechanisms, sub-hypergraph construction, adaptive fusion, and the derivation of the global hypergraph incidence matrix 𝐇 g \\u200b l \\u200b o \\u200b b \\u200b a \\u200b l \\\\mathbf{H}_{global} are performed, followed by the JSD-based weighting mechanism and hypergraph convolution to derive enhanced global representations for both modalities. These representations are then reshaped back to ℝ N × T × D \\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times T\\\\times D} , yielding 𝐙 G \\u200b C \\u200b H ( m ) \\\\mathbf{Z}^{(m)}_{GCH} . Comprehensive formulations of these processes are provided in Appendix B .\\nThe GCH captures industry-wide trends, sectoral correlations, and market-wide sentiment flows, thereby complementing the micro-level temporal patterns learned by the LCH. Working in concert, these two hypergraphs yield a multi-context representation: the LCH effectively models short-term responses—such as how individual stocks react to technical indicators or news—while the GCH contextualizes these reactions within overarching market dynamics. Collectively, this hypergraph architecture forms a robust foundation for comprehensive market understanding, enabling rich multi-modal and multi-scale representations.\\nFollowing hypergraph processing, we incorporate a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) to enrich semantic representations and facilitate advanced multimodal reasoning across the aligned numerical and textual modalities. Specifically, the quantitative and news embeddings 𝐙 G \\u200b C \\u200b H quant , 𝐙 G \\u200b C \\u200b H news ∈ ℝ N × T × D \\\\mathbf{Z}^{\\\\text{quant}}_{GCH},\\\\mathbf{Z}^{\\\\text{news}}_{GCH}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times T\\\\times D} produced by the GCH are further refined through an LLM-based reasoning layer.\\nWe employ the frozen Llama-3.2-1B model, chosen for its favorable trade-off between semantic reasoning capacity and computational efficiency. Freezing the LLM parameters preserves its extensive linguistic and financial domain-specific knowledge acquired during pre-training, while lightweight adapter layers are utilized to perform modality alignment and feature fusion without imposing significant training costs.\\nFirst, the quantitative and news features are concatenated along the feature dimension:\\nThe concatenated representations are then projected into the LLM input space via a multimodal fusion network:\\nwhere D LLM = 2048 D_{\\\\text{LLM}}=2048 denotes the hidden dimension of the Llama-3.2-1B model. The fused embeddings are subsequently processed by the frozen LLM to yield high-level semantic representations:\\nThis design enables the framework to exploit the LLM’s pre-trained understanding of finance, market structures, and contextual semantics while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter freezing. The LLM serves as a semantic reasoning engine that enhances multimodal feature representations with deep linguistic and financial knowledge, thereby augmenting the model’s capacity for nuanced and context-aware market prediction.\\nStock markets exhibit heterogeneous behaviors across multiple scales—from global sentiment shifts to sector-specific momentum. We propose a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) architecture comprising two complementary expert pools: Shared Market Experts, which model overarching market regimes, and Industry-specialized Experts, which capture sector-level dynamics. Leveraging sparse activation, only the most relevant experts are dynamically selected based on market context and industry characteristics, ensuring high model expressiveness with efficient computation.\\nA central innovation of this module lies in the parametric style space: each expert incorporates learnable style parameters that enable distinct predictive strategies.\\nDuring training, these parameters naturally differentiate across experts—yielding diverse strategic orientations such as bullish versus bearish or conservative versus aggressive. This diversity fosters a broad spectrum of adaptive trading perspectives among the experts.\\nIndividual stock dynamics are strongly conditioned by the broader market environment. Distinct market regimes, such as bullish, bearish, or high-volatility phases, exhibit systematic patterns that collectively shape asset behavior. The Shared Market Experts module is designed to infer the prevailing market regime and to adapt its specialization accordingly.\\nTo capture the global market state, we first flatten 𝐙 L \\u200b L \\u200b M ∈ ℝ N × T × D L \\u200b L \\u200b M \\\\mathbf{Z}_{LLM}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times T\\\\times D_{LLM}} into ℝ N × T ⋅ D L \\u200b L \\u200b M \\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times T\\\\cdot D_{LLM}} , yielding 𝐙 f \\u200b l \\u200b a \\u200b t \\\\mathbf{Z}_{flat} . This representation is then projected into a lower-dimensional space ℝ N × D \\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\times D} to reduce dimensionality and computational overhead. Next, we derive the market state by aggregating information across all stocks:\\nwhere W r ∈ ℝ D × D m W_{r}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D\\\\times D_{m}} projects features into a market-representative subspace, and W l ∈ ℝ 1 × N W_{l}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times N} performs cross-stock aggregation. These projections allow the model to learn both which features are most informative for market-state inference and how to optimally aggregate asset-level information.\\nThe resulting market state is then concatenated with individual stock features to construct an augmented representation:\\nensuring that each stock’s routing decision reflects both local characteristics and global market context.\\nEach Shared Market Expert j j is parameterized by a learnable style vector 𝐬 j m \\u200b k \\u200b t ∈ ℝ D s \\\\mathbf{s}_{j}^{mkt}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D_{s}} , which defines its regime-specific specialization:\\nThrough training, these style vectors evolve into distinct market archetypes—such as bullish, bearish, or neutral—enabling the ensemble to capture a diverse and adaptive set of prediction and trading behaviors across varying market conditions.\\nBeyond market-level influences, sector-specific forces often drive synchronized movements within industries, shaped by shared fundamentals or supply-chain dependencies. The Industry-specialized Experts complements the market view by modeling these intra-sector dynamics through experts specialized in distinct industry behaviors.\\nThis module leverages the higher-order sectoral relationships 𝐇 g \\u200b l \\u200b o \\u200b b \\u200b a \\u200b l \\\\mathbf{H}_{global} learned by the Global Context Hypergraph (GCH) to guide industry-aware routing:\\nThe transformation extracts industry embeddings that capture latent cross-sector dependencies and evolving sectoral relationships. Each stock’s representation is then augmented as:\\nwhere 𝐈 i \\\\mathbf{I}_{i} is the i i -th row of 𝐈 \\\\mathbf{I} , representing the industry-level embedding associated with stock i i . This design provides the routing mechanism with both asset-specific and industrial context. For instance, a semiconductor stock might be routed to experts specializing simultaneously in technology momentum, global supply-chain shifts, and cyclical manufacturing patterns.\\nEach Industry-specialized Expert k k also maintains a learnable style vector 𝐬 k i \\u200b n \\u200b d ∈ ℝ D s \\\\mathbf{s}_{k}^{ind}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D_{s}} :\\nThese style vectors encourage differentiation among experts, promoting the emergence of specialized sectoral archetypes—some focusing on defensive industries, others on growth-oriented technology or cyclical manufacturing sectors.\\nFinally, both expert modules employ sparse gating with top-K selection to aggregate outputs from the most relevant experts in their respective pools, yielding 𝐡 i m \\u200b k \\u200b t , 𝐡 i i \\u200b n \\u200b d \\\\mathbf{h}^{mkt}_{i},\\\\mathbf{h}^{ind}_{i} for each stock i i , respectively. Detailed formulations of the routing and weighted aggregation processes are provided in Appendix C .\\nThe SSMoEs module integrates complementary insights from both global market and industrial perspectives via an flexible aggregation mechanism. This layer coordinates expert selection and aggregation across both pools, producing final predictions that adapt to multi-scale market structures.\\nSpecifically, the final integration stage adaptively combines outputs from both expert pools through a learnable nonlinear fusion:\\nwhere W mkt , W ind ∈ ℝ d × d W_{\\\\text{mkt}},W_{\\\\text{ind}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\\\times d} are learnable weights controlling the relative influence of market and industry signals, and σ \\u200b ( ⋅ ) \\\\sigma(\\\\cdot) denotes a nonlinear activation. By integrating broad and granular insights, the SSMoEs captures multi-scale dependencies, yielding representations that reflect each stock’s unique position within the evolving market ecosystem.\\nThe fused representation 𝐳 i \\\\mathbf{z}_{i} is finally passed through a FFN followed by softmax to generate the binary classification probabilities 𝐲 ^ i = [ y ^ i , 0 , y ^ i , 1 ] \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{y}}_{i}=[\\\\hat{y}_{i,0},\\\\hat{y}_{i,1}] for each stock i i , indicating the likelihood of an upward price movement d d days ahead.\\nTo optimize the model, we employ a composite loss function that combines the classification objective with two auxiliary losses for balanced expert utilization. The classification component adopts the cross-entropy loss:\\nwhere y i ∈ { 0 , 1 } y_{i}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\} denotes the ground-truth label for the i i -th stock.\\nTo encourage balanced expert utilization within both expert pools, we incorporate sequence-wise auxiliary losses (Liu et\\xa0al., 2024a ) . For each module, the auxiliary loss is formulated as:\\nwhere f i f_{i} represents the fraction of stocks routed to expert i i , P i P_{i} denotes the average routing probability assigned to expert i i , and N e N_{e} is the total number of experts. This term promotes uniform expert utilization while preserving specialization among experts.\\nThe overall loss function combines all components as:\\nwhere α \\\\alpha and β \\\\beta are the balance factors.',\n",

       "        'paragraphs': 'The Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) is designed to model the intricate spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in financial markets, where individual stock movements are jointly influenced by immediate behavioral patterns and market narratives. Unlike conventional methods relying on fixed temporal windows or predefined, static correlations, the LCH flexibly discovers dynamic group relationships of stock–time quantitative and textual instances that exhibit coordinated behaviors by representing each stock at each timestamp as a distinct node within a hypergraph. This formulation preserves fine-grained temporal resolution while leveraging hyperedges to model group-wise dependencies that evolve over time.\\nTo achieve unified processing across temporal and spatial dimensions, we flatten the stock and time dimensions to obtain 𝐙 f \\u200b l \\u200b a \\u200b t ( m ) ∈ ℝ N ⋅ T × D \\\\mathbf{Z}^{(m)}_{flat}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{N\\\\cdot T\\\\times D} for each modality m ∈ { quantitative , news } m\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{quantitative},\\\\text{news}\\\\} , where each row represents a unique stock–time instance. The core innovation lies in constructing multimodal sub-hypergraphs that capture distinct types of dependencies: temporal correlations within numerical indicators, semantic coherence across news narratives, and the bidirectional interplay between quantitative and textual modalities. This design explicitly acknowledges that market behaviors are governed by fundamentally heterogeneous forms of relationships and modalities.\\nFor each modality pair ( m i , m j ) (m_{i},m_{j}) (quantitative or news), a specialized sub-hypergraph is learned via adaptive projection:\\nwhere FFN l \\u200b o \\u200b c \\u200b a \\u200b l ( m i , m j ) \\\\text{FFN}_{local}^{(m_{i},m_{j})} is a modality-pair-specific network that learns to identify E 1 E_{1} latent hyperedges, each representing a set of stock–time instances exhibiting coordinated behaviors. This formulation yields four distinct sub-hypergraphs corresponding to intra- and inter-modal relationships intertwined with critical market dynamics:\\nQuantitative–Quantitative Dynamics : Captures temporal momentum and volatility clustering within numerical market indicators;\\nNews–News Coherence : Models semantic coherence and the propagation of narratives across the news landscape;\\nQuantitative–News Alignment : Aligns market reactions with contemporaneous news events. This cross-modal sub-hypergraph learns how current price patterns co-occur with specific news narratives, contextualizing stock movements within the textual information;\\nNews–Quantitative Anticipation : Represents the inverse relationship—how news content anticipates market movements. This component captures predictive cues embedded in texts that may not yet manifest in price dynamics.\\nThis symmetric design explicitly differentiates between the market’s reactive and anticipatory responses to news information.\\nAlthough these sub-hypergraphs encode complementary aspects of market behavior, their relative importance fluctuates with changing market regimes. Rather than treating all relationships uniformly, the LCH employs an adaptive multi-hypergraph fusion mechanism:\\nThis fusion network dynamically weights and integrates the intra- and cross-modal sub-hypergraphs in accordance with the prevailing market context. Subsequently, z-score normalization is applied to each element within the hyperedges, followed by a column-wise softmax operation to ensure that each hyperedge constitutes a probability distribution over nodes, resulting in the unified incidence matrix 𝐇 l \\u200b o \\u200b c \\u200b a \\u200b l \\\\mathbf{H}_{local} .\\nHowever, not all hyperedges contribute equally to modeling market structure.

Table 5 summarizes the comprehensive results across the three datasets.\\nThe results demonstrate that each component is indispensable, as its removal leads to substantial performance degradation across all metrics.\\nAmong the variants,\\nremoving the Local Context Hypergraph module ( w/o LCH ) yields the most severe deterioration, with annual returns plummeting from 50.00% to 16.47% on DJIA and from 70.80% to 7.40% on NASDAQ 100, alongside a reduction in the Calmar Ratio from 4.380 to 0.331 on NASDAQ 100.\\nEliminating the frozen LLM semantic reasoning layer ( w/o LLM ) produces a similarly adverse effect, reducing annual returns to 9.78% on NASDAQ 100 (versus 70.80% for the full model) and decreasing the Sharpe Ratio from 2.100 to 0.451. Likewise, replacing the SSMoEs with a standard feedforward network ( w/o SSMoEs ) causes notable degradation, with returns declining to 16.52% (DJIA) and 12.20% (NASDAQ 100), compared to 50.00% and 70.80% achieved by the complete model.',\n",

The trading universe comprises all constituent stocks within each index. The core design follows a dynamic d d -day trading cycle with adaptive portfolio construction and a stop-loss mechanism, where d d denotes both the prediction horizon and the rebalancing frequency. The pseudocode for the Dynamic d d -Day Trading Strategy is presented in Algorithm 1 . All transaction adjustments incorporate transaction costs.\\nPrediction Generation : The model outputs the probability of price rise d d days ahead for all stocks, which we use to rank them.\\nPortfolio Construction with Stop-Loss Mechanism : We define a portfolio selection proportion p p (where 0 < p ≤ 1 0<p\\\\leq 1 ). On each rebalancing day:\\nIf the number of stocks predicted to rise (with probability > > 0.5) d d days ahead is at least p × N p\\\\times N , we purchase the top p × N p\\\\times N stocks;\\nIf the number of rising predictions falls into an intermediate zone, specifically p × N × q ≤ M < p × N p\\\\times N\\\\times q\\\\leq M<p\\\\times N (where q q is a stop-loss threshold hyperparameter with 0 < q < 1 0<q<1 ), then we adopt a conservative approach: only buy the top r × M r\\\\times M predicted rising stocks (with 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 0\\\\leq r\\\\leq 1 );\\nIf the number of rising predictions is below p × N × q p\\\\times N\\\\times q , we do not buy new positions and liquidate all current holdings to avoid downside exposure.\\nPortfolio Reconstitution : Positions excluded from the new targets are liquidated with proceeds credited to cash. New target stocks are then purchased with equal capital allocation, subject to current available cash.\\nPortfolio Rebalancing : To maintain equal-capital allocations, we adjust positions—selling excess holdings that exceed target allocation and purchasing additional shares for under-allocated positions.\\nHold Period : Between rebalancing days, all positions are held constant without any trading activity. Portfolio values are recorded daily for performance tracking, but no transactions occur until the next rebalancing day.\\nThis backtesting strategy facilitates direct evaluation of model predictions and profitability within a realistic trading environment. For our framework, we set d = 10 d=10 days, balancing prediction reliability with reduced transaction costs from less frequent rebalancing.\\nFor each model–dataset pair, we perform grid search on the validation set across three hyperparameters in the trading strategy:\\nPortfolio Selection Ratio p ∈ { 0.05 , 0.10 , … , 1.0 } p\\\\in\\\\{0.05,0.10,\\\\ldots,1.0\\\\} ,\\nStop-Loss Threshold q ∈ { 0.05 , 0.10 , … , 0.95 } q\\\\in\\\\{0.05,0.10,\\\\ldots,0.95\\\\} , and\\nRising Ratio for Partial Entry r ∈ { 0.0 , 0.05 , … , 1.0 } r\\\\in\\\\{0.0,0.05,\\\\ldots,1.0\\\\} .\\nThe optimal combination yielding the highest Sharpe ratio on the validation set is applied to the test set for final evaluation.

Existing approaches often fail to unify structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen–Shannon Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware specialization under sparse activation.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval, allowing models to access information beyond their training data. These systems have shown impressive results in general-purpose applications such as technical support [ 1 ] , coding assistants [ 2 ] , and document summarization [ 3 ] , especially when operating as proof-of-concepts on publicly available or loosely structured data.\\nHowever, deploying such systems at scale in highly specialized and tightly regulated domains such as financial technology is far from straightforward [ 4 , 5 ] .\\nFintech-specific use cases often involve structured-unstructured data (or tightly regulated free text), such as proprietary knowledge bases, role-based access to information, and stringent compliance constraints [ 6 ] , all of which make it difficult to repurpose existing tools and methodologies designed for open-domain settings or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based environments. These complexities are both technical and organizational. Regulatory restrictions prohibit data from leaving organisational boundaries, making cloud-hosted APIs or third-party evaluation platforms unsuitable for most practical deployments. In addition, often fintech firms follow a compartmentalized structure with clear divisions of responsibility between product managers, analysts, compliance officers, and engineers. This further complicates how knowledge is captured, retrieved, and applied.\\nFor example, consider a product manager in Mastercard analyzing feature alignment across offerings such as MDES (Mastercard Digital Enablement Service) 1 1 1 https://www.mastercard.com/newsroom/press/news-briefs/mastercard-digital-enablement-service-mdes , Accessed: 2025-06-25 , M4M (Mastercard for Merchants) [ 7 ] , and SwitchCore (Mastercard’s transaction switching platform) [ 8 ] .\\nInternal knowledge sources—ranging from note-taking apps, product management platforms and architecture decks to regulatory compliance PDFs—often use acronyms inconsistently or assume implicit context based on team-specific language. This forces the user to manually piece together fragmented information to understand interoperability constraints, roadmap alignment, or API-level integration guidelines. A standard RAG system typically underperforms in such scenarios, frequently misinterpreting short forms like “CMA” (which could mean “Consumer Management Application” or “Cardholder Management Architecture” depending on the context), or retrieving documents based on keyword overlap rather than intent.\\nAnother challenge with such domain-specific use-cases for large enterprises is evaluation. Traditional RAG benchmarks assume public datasets, crowd-sourced relevance judgments, or static ground truth—all of which are infeasible in fintech. Finding subject-matter experts to annotate queries at scale is both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, regulations around confidentiality and data residency prevent the use of crowd platforms for human evaluation.\\nTherefore, designing on-prem, domain-specific RAG applications requires several considerations and not limited to — a careful rethinking of architecture, privacy guarantees, a structured retrieval and reasoning process capable of adapting to ambiguity (especially when the source content is internal, fragmented, and often acronym-heavy). In this work, we focus on some of these core challenges and propose an agent design tailored to domain-specific retrieval and reasoning. We also present evaluation methodologies that are secure, reproducible, and feasible at scale within enterprise constraints.\\nWe propose a hierarchical agent framework, where an Orchestrator Agent delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents responsible for acronym resolution, domain-aware query rewriting, and cross-encoder-based re-ranking. This modular structure allows the system to encode organizational idiosyncrasies such as internal taxonomies, access controls, and documentation practices, significantly improving the quality of answers retrieved. In addition, we develop a semi-automated evaluation strategy that combines LLM-as-a-judge [ 9 ] paradigms with constrained prompt templates and human-in-the-loop validation. Inspired by recent work on synthetic evaluation datasets [ 9 , 10 ] , we leverage internal knowledge bases to generate realistic query-answer pairs, which are then assessed using a mix of LLM scoring and manual spot-checking. This allows for a secure, efficient, and consistent evaluation process that scales across teams and data silos.\\nTo summarize, our primary contributions include:\\nA Fintech-focused Agentic Design: We develop an Orchestrator Agent that coordinates specialized agents for acronym resolution, iterative sub-query generation using key phrases, and context refinement through a cross-encoder re-ranking method.\\nAutomatic Query Enhancement with Continuous Feedback: Our system proactively identifies and resolves domain-specific acronyms within user queries and retrieved content, enhancing retrieval accuracy and answer completeness.\\nThorough Evaluation Methodology: We construct an evaluation dataset from an enterprise knowledge base, leveraging LLM-driven synthetic data generation and manual validation to ensure high-quality, contextually relevant questions.\\nEmpirical Comparative Analysis: We quantitatively and qualitatively compare our agentic approach against a standard RAG baseline, measuring effectiveness through metrics such as retrieval accuracy and answer relevance.\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews relevant work in RAG, multi-agent pipelines, and domain-specific retrieval systems. Section III describes our methodology, including the design of the baseline and agentic RAG architectures. Section IV details the knowledge base preparation and the construction of the evaluation dataset. Section V presents the experimental setup and results, comparing retrieval accuracy and latency across configurations. Section VI provides a qualitative error analysis and discussion of observed performance patterns. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper and outlines directions for future work.',\n",

These attributes make it an effective benchmark for systematically evaluating the incremental improvements introduced by each advanced component of the proposed agentic architecture.\\nThe Agentic RAG system, which will be referred to as \"A-RAG\" throughout this paper, is designed to address the limitations inherent in the B-RAG system by integrating modular intelligence and task-specific specialization. Central to A-RAG is the Orchestrator Agent , which coordinates a suite of specialized agents, each tasked with a distinct retrieval or synthesis function. This design is inspired by an investigative research workflow. It initiates with a direct attempt to address the user query, subsequently evaluates the output, and when necessary, activates more focused and iterative exploration.\\nTo address challenges such as ambiguous terminology, fragmented sources, and answer confidence, A-RAG incorporates several key capabilities, including acronym resolution, sub-query generation, parallel retrieval, re-ranking, and quality assessment. The quality of generated answers is evaluated by a dedicated QA agent whose confidence score determines whether further iterative refinement is required. A comparison of the hybrid pipeline architectures for B-RAG and A-RAG workflows is shown in Figure 3 . It highlights the differences in processing flow and iterative mechanisms.\\nThe A-RAG system comprises a set of lightweight, modular agents orchestrated to support iterative retrieval and reasoning. The following subsections describe the system’s core agent components and the operational workflow using a representative fintech query example.\\nThe orchestrator coordinates eight specialized agents, each responsible for a distinct stage in the retrieval–reasoning cycle:\\nIntent Classifier – determines whether the user input requires (i) retrieval , which involves fetching new context from the knowledge base, or (ii) summary , which compresses existing conversational history.\\nQuery Reformulator – transforms the raw query into a dense, keyword-optimized search string by removing function words, expanding recognized acronyms, and injecting domain-specific synonyms to maximize embedding-based recall.\\nRetriever Manager & Retriever Agent – launch one or more vector store queries—executed in parallel if sub-queries exist—and return the top- k k most relevant chunks.\\nSub-Query Generator – in cases of low initial retrieval scores, identifies 2–3 key entities or phrases to construct targeted follow-up queries.\\nRe-Ranker Agent – reorders the retrieved chunks using a cross-encoder to prioritize those with higher semantic alignment to the query.\\nSummary Agent – fuses the ranked context snippets into a concise, citation-style answer composed strictly from the retrieved content.\\nQA Agent – evaluates the synthesized answer on a 0–10 scale, assessing relevance and support from context; the score determines whether the pipeline concludes or proceeds with refinement.\\nAcronym Resolution Logic – manages a local glossary and, when invoked, appends in-line definitions to prevent downstream agents from misinterpreting shorthand expressions.\\nThe operational workflow integrates the agent components into a cohesive, adaptive pipeline, illustrated with the example query: “How is CVaR calculated in the IRRBB framework?” The process begins with query reformulation and acronym expansion, ensuring clarity and disambiguation of terms like CVaR and IRRBB . A first-pass vector retrieval fetches relevant document chunks, which are synthesized into an initial answer. If the QA agent assigns a low confidence score, the system triggers refinement: sub-queries such as “CVaR formula” or “IRRBB risk quantification” are generated, results are re-ranked, and a revised synthesis is attempted. Should this prove inadequate, a broader retrieval sweep is conducted to increase coverage. In the absence of a sufficiently confident answer, the system transparently communicates its uncertainty to the user. This adaptive pipeline dynamically balances computational efficiency with retrieval depth based on answer confidence.',\n",

A comparison of the hybrid pipeline architectures for B-RAG and A-RAG workflows is shown in Figure 3 . It highlights the differences in processing flow and iterative mechanisms.',\n",

We evaluated both systems using two key metrics: (1) Retrieval Accuracy (Hit Rate @5), defined as the percentage of questions for which the correct document source appeared among the top five retrieved links; and (2) Average Latency, defined as the time from user query submission to the final system response.\\nTable I summarizes the results. The A-RAG system achieved a strict retrieval accuracy of 62.35%, outperforming the Baseline’s 54.12%. This performance gain can be attributed to the system’s specialized agents for acronym resolution and sub-query expansion, which were designed to address the fragmented and semantically sparse nature of enterprise knowledge described in Section I . As expected, A-RAG’s average query latency was 5.02 seconds, significantly higher than B-RAG’s 0.79 seconds, due to multi-stage processing and iterative document re-ranking.\\nAlthough retrieval was evaluated using exact link matches, manual inspection identified several queries where the system returned correct content from semantically equivalent but non-identical documents. Specifically, A-RAG retrieved valid answers from alternate sources in six additional cases, and B-RAG in three. Incorporating these, the adjusted retrieval accuracy increases to 69.41% for A-RAG and 58.82% for B-RAG. These cases reinforce the core challenge introduced in Section I ; that enterprise knowledge in fintech domains is often fragmented, with key information distributed across related documents. Unlike B-RAG, which often fails when the exact match is missing, A-RAG’s sub-query generation and iterative re-ranking modules better synthesize partial context across sources, producing correct responses even when the originating chunk is not directly retrieved. In the next section we evaluate answer quality using semantic accuracy , defined as the mean LLM-judge score measuring semantic equivalence between a system’s answer and the human ground-truth answer, independent of surface lexical overlap.\\nBuilding on the retrieval metrics in Table I (Section V-B ), we next measure how faithfully each pipeline answers user questions. Rather than lexical overlap, we target semantic agreement with the ground-truth answers created in Section IV .\\nWe define the following metric to calculate the semantic accuracy. Let N N denote the total number of evaluated questions (here N = 85 N=85 ).

These observations align with the core challenge described in Section I: enterprise fintech documents are semantically sparse and often distribute relevant information across multiple partially redundant pages.\\nQualitative analysis revealed that the most effective agentic component was sub-query generation, which enabled targeted exploration of edge cases where the initial query lacked specificity. Acronym resolution proved more error-prone: in cases of ambiguous or undefined acronyms, the agent occasionally surfaced overly generic sources. The cross-encoder re-ranking improved relevance when multiple near-matches were retrieved but introduced latency. These trade-offs confirm that while A-RAG design introduces computational overhead, its modular structure is more robust to domain-specific ambiguity than the static B-RAG pipeline.\\nAs shown in the human-curated benchmark (Table III ), A-RAG achieves higher overall coverage (69.70% vs. 66.67%) and a modest improvement in semantic accuracy (8.06 vs. 7.88), indicating enhanced consolidation of dispersed evidence. The gains are most evident in procedural queries, where coverage reaches 100% and semantic quality rises to 8.25. This suggests that iterative sub-query expansion is particularly effective when task steps are implicit. In contrast, acronym and definitional queries do not show consistent improvements—acronym coverage declines (57.14% to 42.85%), and definitional coverage decreases slightly. These outcomes imply that acronym resolution and re-ranking mechanisms may occasionally over-filter or misprioritize near-duplicate sources. Nevertheless, the identical acronym semantic scores (8.25) suggest that A-RAG can synthesize sufficient context from partial retrieval. Overall, the “many plausible answers” setting underscores both the robustness advantages of agentic orchestration and specific limitations (e.g., acronym recall) that warrant further investigation.\\nThe A-RAG pipeline explicitly handled two challenges central to fintech ontologies: acronym disambiguation and context fragmentation. By integrating an acronym helper agent and embedding definitions where available, the system was able to expand domain-specific abbreviations during both query reformulation and document re-ranking. However, this component showed limitations in edge cases where acronyms were neither defined nor contextually grounded in the document. In contrast, B-RAG relied entirely on surface-level keyword overlap, often missing results that required any interpretive inference.\\nSub-query phrasing also improved navigation through the ontology by decomposing vague or overloaded user queries into focused, domain-aligned sub-tasks. This was impactful for queries that implicitly referenced process hierarchies or tools—common in enterprise documentation. Overall, the A-RAG system demonstrated a stronger ability to operate within the constraints of a specialized ontology, especially when semantic cues in the documents were minimal or inconsistently structured.\\nThe study is constrained by several factors. Firstly, the evaluation dataset is relatively small (85 questions) and may not reflect the full spectrum of real-world queries or document structures in fintech. Secondly, all results are grounded in the use of a single LLM ( Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct ) and embedding model, limiting generalization across architectures. Thirdly, certain agents (e.g., acronym resolver) rely on heuristic definitions and simple regex-based expansion, which may under perform in more complex acronym usage. Lastly, while adjusted accuracy was discussed, it is not backed by a formal metric; a more rigorous semantic equivalence measure should be incorporated in future work to better capture retrieval performance in fragmented corpora.',\n",

In contrast, B-RAG relied entirely on surface-level keyword overlap, often missing results that required any interpretive inference.\\nSub-query phrasing also improved navigation through the ontology by decomposing vague or overloaded user queries into focused, domain-aligned sub-tasks.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Advancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, particularly in domains like mathematical problem-solving. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) (Gao et\\xa0al., 2024 ; DeepSeek-AI et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , especially through policy optimization methods like GRPO (Shao et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address this challenge.\\nAs shown in Figure 1 (a), in this framework, the space of potential solution paths for a query can be modeled as a specific ‘Reasoning Tree’ (Wang et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Yang et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , where each node represents an intermediate reasoning step and each path represents a potential solution trajectory.\\nFrom this perspective, RLVR operates as a dynamic ‘node-editing’ process of the reasoning tree: by rewarding correct paths and penalizing incorrect ones, the model iteratively refines its decision policy at each tree node.\\nThis optimization process gradually prunes branches that lead to low-quality or incorrect solutions, thereby improving overall reasoning accuracy.\\nIn this paradigm, data scheduling plays a critical role in model performance (Hu et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Yu et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Li et\\xa0al., 2025 ) .\\nThe concept of data scheduling originates from curriculum learning (Bengio et\\xa0al., 2009 ) ,\\nwhich posits that models learn more effectively when training examples (queries) are organized in a meaningful sequence. Existing data scheduling strategies typically pre-define a‘difficulty’ metric for queries, and and schedule them from easy to hard to improve data efficiency and final performance (Xi et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Chen et\\xa0al., 2025b ; a ; Dai et\\xa0al., 2025 ) However, from a reasoning tree perspective, current difficulty measure strategies exhibits a critical limitation: current methods estimate difficulty primarily via final solution accuracy, overlooking richer query-level characteristics such as the structural complexity of the reasoning tree. Accuracy alone is insufficient — low accuracy does not necessarily indicate that a query is inherently hard, and high accuracy does not guarantee ease of optimization. This inconsistency can undermine the efficacy of accuracy-based scheduling approaches. We illustrate this issue with the following examples.\\nTo illustrate, consider two representative queries, q1 and q2 , whose reasoning trees are shown in Figure 1 (a). As depicted in Figure 1 (b), LLMs may exhibit low initial accuracy on q1 , due to the presence of many incorrect solution trajectories (reasoning paths). However, its simple tree structure means that modifying a few key decision nodes can yield substantial accuracy gains, indicating high learning efficiency despite the poor initial performance. In contrast, q2 achieves higher initial accuracy, with roughly half of its trajectories being correct, yet these correct paths are scattered across disparate subtrees. This fragmented structure requires more extensive edits across numerous tree nodes, typically resulting in higher training difficulty and lower learning efficiency.\\nCritically, existing path-based metrics will misinterpret q1 ’s low accuracy as high difficulty, thus assigning it a lower training weight, while incorrectly prioritizing the more difficult q2 . Such path-based metrics may lead to a less efficient training process.\\nThis motivates our central research question: How can we move beyond path-based metrics to directly quantify a query’s true learning difficulty from its reasoning-tree structure?\\nTo address this question, we introduce the Reasoning Score (r-score), a novel metric that quantifies a query’s learning potential based on its reasoning tree structure. We formalize this by framing the reinforcement learning training process as an optimization problem under a finite ’node editing budget’, which we define as a fixed number of node editing operations. Consequently, a query’s r-score is its maximum potential accuracy gain achievable within this limited editing budget. This metric clearly explains the discrepancy in our example: q1 , with its ‘concentrated’ error structure, yields a high r-score because a small budget (e.g., two edits) produces a massive accuracy gain (+75%). Conversely, q2 ’s ‘diffuse’ structure results in a low r-score, as the same budget only yields marginal improvement (+25%). Therefore, a higher r-score signifies a more tractable reasoning structure and greater learning efficiency, offering a more comprehensive assessment of difficulty than path-based metrics.\\nBuilding on the Reasoning Score, we propose the R easoning Tr e e Schedule (Re-Schedule) , a novel data scheduling algorithm designed to guide RLVR training more efficiently. Our method consists of three main stages. First, an offline approximation of each query’s reasoning tree is constructed by sampling multiple solution trajectories from a base model. Second, this approximated reasoning tree is used to calculate each query’s reasoning score by simulating the editing process. Finally, we integrate the r-score as a dynamic weight into the RLVR loss function to form a schedule. This schedule prioritizes high-scoring (simple) queries in the initial training phases to accelerate convergence on simple queries. As training progresses, the weighting gradually shifts to lower-scoring (difficult) queries, enabling the model to master more challenging problems.\\nIn summary, the main contributions of this paper are:\\nWe introduce the Reasoning Score (r-score), a new tree-based metric that measures a query’s learning efficiency rather than its path-based solution accuracy.\\nWe propose Re-Schedule, a data scheduling algorithm that uses the r-score to create an effective, easy-to-hard curriculum for RLVR.\\nAs shown in Figure 1 (c), we empirically demonstrate that our approach significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to 3.2%, on complex reasoning tasks.',\n",

The structure of this tree, 𝒯 \\\\mathcal{T} , is defined by a branching factor k k , a maximum depth d d , and a token interval l l (e.g., k = 4 , d = 4 , l = 200 k=4,d=4,l=200 ).\\nThe construction process begins at the root node (the query q q ) and proceeds via a periodic branching strategy during response generation. Specifically, a branch is triggered immediately at the beginning of the response and subsequently at every l l -token interval. As shown in Figure 3 (a), at each trigger, the current path splits into k k independent sub-paths that continue to generate in parallel. This recursive branching process continues until a predefined maximum depth d d is reached. To minimize computational overhead from this multi-path sampling, we use the Key-Value (KV) Cache, as all sibling branches share the same prefix.\\nIn RLVR tasks, a solution’s quality is determined by the correctness of its final answer, which corresponds to a leaf node in our framework. Therefore, we define the quality of any intermediate node n i n_{i} as the average accuracy of its leaf descendants, ℒ \\u200b ( n i ) \\\\mathcal{L}(n_{i}) . This is quantified using an accuracy function:\\nwhere S S is a set of leaf nodes and 𝕀 \\u200b ( ⋅ ) \\\\mathbb{I}(\\\\cdot) is the indicator function. This allows us to assess quality at different levels: the quality of a reasoning segment via ACC \\u200b ( ℒ \\u200b ( n i ) ) \\\\text{ACC}(\\\\mathcal{L}(n_{i})) and the model’s aggregate performance on the query via ACC \\u200b ( 𝒩 leaf ) \\\\text{ACC}(\\\\mathcal{N}_{\\\\text{leaf}}) .\\nThe r-score quantifies the learning potential of a node or query by measuring the maximum achievable accuracy gain under a limited policy refining cost, like a limited node editing budget.\\nGiven this idea, for any non-leaf node n i n_{i} , we define its r-score, R \\u200b ( n i ) R(n_{i}) , as the maximal accuracy gain achievable by selecting its single best child branch and pruning all others. This is formulated as:\\nThe overall r-score for a query, R \\u200b ( q ) R(q) , estimates the total accuracy gain achievable under a budget that limits modifications to a maximum of M M nodes. It is the maximum sum of r-scores from any set of M M non-conflicting nodes (e.g., for a budget of M = 4 M=4 ):\\nTwo nodes are considered conflicting if one is located in a subtree that is implicitly pruned by the optimal branch selection of the other.\\nIntuitively, solving Equation ( 7 ) represents the evaluation process of the sub-tree’s structure, while a simpler structure of reasoning tree starting from n i n_{i} yields a higher R \\u200b ( n i ) R(n_{i}) . Combining the evaluation R \\u200b ( n i ) R(n_{i}) of each node n i n_{i} under a limited budget M M , solving Equation ( 8 ) is to find the maximum achievable accuracy gain over the reasoning tree, like exploring possible combinations of M M nodes and picking the best combination.

Specifically, a branch is triggered immediately at the beginning of the response and subsequently at every l l -token interval. As shown in Figure 3 (a), at each trigger, the current path splits into k k independent sub-paths that continue to generate in parallel. This recursive branching process continues until a predefined maximum depth d d is reached. To minimize computational overhead from this multi-path sampling, we use the Key-Value (KV) Cache, as all sibling branches share the same prefix.\\nIn RLVR tasks, a solution’s quality is determined by the correctness of its final answer, which corresponds to a leaf node in our framework. Therefore, we define the quality of any intermediate node n i n_{i} as the average accuracy of its leaf descendants, ℒ \\u200b ( n i ) \\\\mathcal{L}(n_{i}) .

This set can then be presented to the decision maker for an a posteriori preference articulation and final choice.\\nWhile being a decades-old problem (Vincke 1976 ; Hansen 1980 ; Clímaco and Pascoal 2012 ; Current and Marsh 1993 ; Skriver 2000 ; Tarapata 2007 ; Ulungu and Teghem 1991 ) , in recent years, the study of MOS has attracted growing attention across multiple research communities.\\nDedicated workshops and tutorials addressing complex, often conflicting, objectives\\nhave been featured in mainstream AI\\nvenues\\n(e.g.,\\nAAAI\\xa0[ 2024 ],\\nIJCAI\\xa0[ 2023 ; 2025 ],\\nAAMAS\\xa0[ 2024 ],\\nICAPS\\xa0[ 2024 ],\\nECAI\\xa0[ 2025 ]\\nand\\nSoCS\\xa0[ 2023 ]),\\nand in robotics and machine-learning venues\\n(e.g., RSS\\xa0[ 2025 ]\\nand\\nNeurIPS\\xa0[ 2024 ]).\\nRelated developments are also emerging in operations research (OR), transportation science, and evolutionary computation, where multi-objective optimization has a long tradition but is now being revisited with modern heuristic search, reinforcement learning, and hybrid approaches. This convergence of interests reflects a shared recognition that real-world decision-making rarely optimizes a single criterion, and that principled multi-objective reasoning is essential for building intelligent, robust, and adaptable systems.\\nIn this paper, we highlight recent advances in the field in terms of problem variants, algorithms, applications and emerging directions.

This was only recently formulated by de\\xa0las Casas et\\xa0al. ( 2021 ) . For additional details, see also the recent work by Shovan, Khanda, and Das ( 2025 ) .\\nWhile MOS assumes a deterministic model, many real problems demand richer models. To capture stochasticity, or general optimization beyond paths, several extensions have been studied.\\nEach extends MOS along a different axis while keeping Pareto optimality central. We briefly describe each model, highlighting the similarities and differences compared to MOS.\\nRecall that a MOS problem is defined using a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) together with edge costs 𝐜 \\\\mathbf{c} which present a deterministic model.\\nA Multi-objective Stochastic Shortest Path (MOSSP) problem extends the MOS framework by introducing probabilistic transitions between states (Roijers and Whiteson 2017 ) .\\nFormally, we are given a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) together with edge costs 𝐜 \\\\mathbf{c} and a transition probability distribution over successor vertices.\\nA policy μ \\\\mu maps vertices to successor edges, inducing a distribution over paths from the start s s to the target t t .\\nThe cost of a policy is defined as the expected cumulative cost vector across objectives.\\nAs in MOS, policies are compared using dominance: a policy μ 1 \\\\mu_{1} dominates μ 2 \\\\mu_{2} if it has no worse expected cost in every objective and is strictly better in at least one.\\nThe goal is to compute a coverage PF of policies.\\nA Multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) generalizes MOSSP by adopting an MDP formalism. In contrast to MOSSP which focuses on reaching a target in a stochastic graph with vector costs, MOMDP allow arbitrary horizon settings (e.g., finite, infinite, discounted) and sequential decision-making under uncertainty, not just reaching a target vertex.\\nMulti-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) extends the MOS framework to settings where the agent interacts with an environment through repeated trial-and-error learning rather than having an explicit model of the state-transition dynamics (Hayes et\\xa0al. 2022 ; Felten, Talbi, and Danoy 2024 ) .\\nFormally, MORL is defined over the same structure as an MOMDP, M = ( S , A , P , 𝐜 ) M=(S,A,P,\\\\mathbf{c}) , with state space S S , action space A A , transition function P P , and vector-valued cost or reward function 𝐜 \\u200b ( s , a ) ∈ ℝ d \\\\mathbf{c}(s,a)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} .\\nHowever, unlike MOMDPs, in MORL the transition probabilities and reward distributions are not assumed to be known a priori.\\nInstead, the agent learns a policy μ : S → A \\\\mu:S\\\\to A through experience, typically by interacting with the environment and receiving vector-valued feedback.\\nMORL generalizes MOS in that it seeks Pareto-optimal solutions across multiple objectives, but unlike MOS, it does not assume a static graph with deterministic edges.\\nRelative to MOSSP and MOMDP, MORL replaces planning with learning: instead of computing Pareto-optimal policies from a known model of uncertainty, the agent must discover them through exploration and approximation.\\nThus, MORL inherits the challenges of both reinforcement learning (e.g., exploration-exploitation trade-offs, function approximation) and MOS (e.g., dominance checks).\\nThe goal in MORL remains to approximate the Pareto set of policies, but learning algorithms must balance sample efficiency, preference sensitivity, and scalability in high-dimensional state and objective spaces.\\nIn this paper, we focus on MOS which can be seen as an instance of the more general multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, (see, e.g., (Branke et\\xa0al. 2008 ; Miettinen 2012 ; Roijers and Whiteson 2017 ; Hwang and Masud 2012 ; Emmerich and Deutz 2018 ) ).\\nIt is important to highlight the similarities and differences between the two fields.\\nMOO is the most general formulation of problems in which several, possibly conflicting, objectives must be optimized simultaneously.\\nFormally, given a feasible set 𝒳 \\\\mathcal{X} and objective functions f i : 𝒳 → ℝ f_{i}:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} for i = 1 , … , d i=1,\\\\ldots,d , the problem is to find the set of non-dominated solutions\\nwhere 𝐟 \\u200b ( x ) = ( f 1 \\u200b ( x ) , … , f d \\u200b ( x ) ) \\\\mathbf{f}(x)=(f_{1}(x),\\\\ldots,f_{d}(x)) .\\nHere, 𝒳 ⋆ \\\\mathcal{X}^{\\\\star} corresponds to the Pareto set whose image in ℝ d \\\\mathbb{R}^{d} is the PF.\\nRelative to MOS, MOO generalizes the underlying domain: whereas MOS is defined over paths in a deterministic graph with additive vector costs, MOO is agnostic to the structure of the feasible set and can capture continuous, combinatorial, or black-box domains.\\nCompared to stochastic settings such as MOSSP and MOMDP, MOO does not necessarily assume probabilistic dynamics or sequential decision processes; instead, it focuses purely on the optimization of static or offline-defined objectives.\\nIn contrast to MORL, MOO assumes direct access to the objective functions rather than learning them through interaction.\\nIn this sense, MOO serves as the broad umbrella under which MOS, MOSSP, MOMDP, and MORL can be seen as structured subclasses with additional constraints on the representation of 𝒳 \\\\mathcal{X} , the dynamics of decision-making, and the information available to the algorithm.\\nFrom an algorithmic point of view, in contrast to MOS, which builds upon search algorithms,\\nMOO typically builds upon local and global optimization methods such as\\ngenetic algorithms (Deb et\\xa0al. 2002 ; Deb and Jain 2013 ; Zhang and Li 2007 ) ,\\nparticle swarm optimization (Coello and Lechuga 2002 ) ,\\nand\\nsimulated annealing (Li and Landa-Silva 2011 ) .',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in nearly every scientific discipline, from fluid dynamics to quantitative finance. This ubiquity makes the development of reliable and efficient PDE solvers a central challenge in the field of computational science. In particular, the goal is to find specific solutions of PDEs that satisfy additional initial and/or boundary conditions; this setting is commonly referred to as the initial-boundary value problem (IBVP). While classical numerical methods, such as finite difference and finite element techniques [ 21 ] , can effectively address these problems, their computational cost increases dramatically with the dimensionality of the problem. In particular, most classical methods require a domain discretization, which allows the evaluation of the function at a finite set of predetermined grid points only. As a result, high-dimensional PDEs present particularly daunting challenges that necessitate innovative solution strategies as outlined in [ 17 ] .\\nTo this end, various approaches have been developed that employ machine learning techniques to tackle these problems. Early approaches to solving differential equations with neural networks date back to the pioneering work by Lagaris et al. [ 19 ] , who proposed feedforward architectures that satisfy boundary and initial conditions by construction. Furthermore, various machine learning techniques have been explored to address these challenges, such as the work by [ 38 ] , which aims to recover analytical closed-form solutions through genetic programming.\\nThe introduction of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) [ 32 ] in 2017 revitalized interest in the field of physics-informed machine learning and the application of machine learning-based techniques for solving PDEs. Similar to the Deep Galerkin Method [ 35 ] , PINNs utilize multiple loss terms corresponding to the PDE and the boundary and/or initial conditions to approximate solutions by minimizing the loss. Hence, the network is guided – but not guaranteed – to respect the physics. These methods have demonstrated notable success across various applications, by no means limited to physics, in solving IBVPs [ 17 ] . A large body of follow-up work has sought to improve training stability and scalability using a plethora of approaches, including domain decomposition [ 15 ] , adaptive loss balancing [ 42 ] , improved optimizers [ 39 , 33 ] , resampling [ 44 , 20 , 25 ] and multifidelity extensions [ 23 ] . Although promising, PINNs often suffer from unstable convergence [ 41 , 18 ] . In practice, networks can reach very small PDE residuals while failing to approximate the true solution well. The reason is that the PDE loss term used in PINNs is not monotone with respect to the solution error. As a result, the training loss does not necessarily provide predictive power: low loss does not automatically imply high accuracy. This issue limits the reliability of PINNs as general-purpose PDE solvers. Despite numerous enhancements for PINNs, the aforementioned issue is inherent to the intrinsic structure of PINNs and their underlying optimization scheme.\\nIn general, there are several ways to incorporate physics into a machine learning model: (a) by informing the data, (b) through the loss function, or (c) by modifying the model’s architecture [ 17 ] . Whereas classical PINNs inform the model solely through the loss function (b), there are also hybrid approaches, such as hard-constraint PINNs [ 22 ] , which utilize a PDE-informed loss function in conjunction with a boundary-conditions-informed architecture. In addition, there are several approaches where physics is baked directly into the model architecture. Examples include convolutional networks that hard-code translation symmetry [ 8 ] , equivariant networks for three-dimensional particle systems [ 37 ] , and structure-preserving models such as Hamiltonian [ 13 ] or Lagrangian neural networks [ 9 ] . These architectures ensure physical consistency by design, but are usually specialized to certain physical aspects.\\nIn the realm of physics, symmetries play a dominant role [ 43 ] , inspiring diverse machine learning approaches which are “symmetry-informed”. Examples include symmetry-informed data augmentation for neural PDE solvers [ 5 ] , self-supervised pretraining based on Lie symmetry transformations [ 24 ] , and symmetry-regularized PINNs [ 1 ] , which all exploit the invariance structure of the underlying equations to improve generalization and sample efficiency. Similarly, [ 47 ] leverages Lie symmetry groups to generate data for supervised learning, providing an alternative to physics-informed training. Other methods embed invariant surface conditions into the loss [ 48 ] to enhance the PINN method. Yet another recent line of work [ 45 , 46 ] utilizes Lie symmetries to discover them from data and integrate them into learning architectures, improving long-term predictive accuracy and facilitating practical applications such as equation discovery.\\nIn our approach, we leverage the inherent symmetries of PDEs, namely their Lie symmetries, by integrating them directly into the model structure. This method is in principle possible for any PDE or any corresponding Lie symmetry, as these symmetries inherently generate parametrized and expressive solutions by themselves. Our work integrates predetermined parametrized Lie symmetries as learnable building blocks, enabling the model to compose symmetry transformations to solve PDEs while provably remaining in the space of solutions of the underlying PDE. Consequently, for every set of model parameters, the resulting model exactly satisfies the PDE. As a result, the optimization problem reduces to fitting the initial-boundary values only. This makes the optimization significantly more controllable and eliminates the need for difficult-to-handle PDE loss term used in PINNs, which in our opinion represents the greatest challenge in the PINN method.\\nConsequently, in our model, a decrease of the loss function directly corresponds to an enhancement of the accuracy of the prediction. Hence, in contrast to PINNs, the loss function serves as a reliable metric for evaluating training progress. In addition, for well-posed IBVPs, one can derive rigorous error bounds that scale with the test loss. Moreover, this approach allows us to design significantly smaller models (in terms of the number of parameters), while preserving a high degree of expressiveness. As a result, this enables more robust optimization leading to more accurate approximations in significantly less time compared to PINNs.\\nThe article is structured as follows:\\nWe begin by introducing the underlying problem: IBVPs ( section 2.2 ) with their associated PDEs ( section 2.1 ). These concepts are introduced in a way that is useful for the study of Lie symmetries, which are reviewed in section 2.3 . We complement the discussion of Lie symmetries with more details in section A.1 . In section 3 we propose our new method LieSolver , which is specialized to linear homogeneous PDEs. section 4 presents our experiments, testing the scope of LieSolver and comparing it with PINNs, demonstrating that our approach leads to more accurate solutions that can be computed significantly faster.\\nTo summarize the contributions of our work, we provide:\\nThe new machine learning framework LieSolver based on Lie symmetries, which aims to solve IBVPs. This method will enforce PDE exactly, by the use of a PDE-informed architecture. Learning happens only on the boundary domain and requires no data, as arbitrary data points can be sampled as needed. Our approach is currently limited to linear homogeneous PDEs.\\nAn illustration of how to derive rigorous error bounds from the test loss in well-posed problems.\\nThe path towards theoretical convergence guarantees. We do not prove any bounds rigorously.\\nBenchmark experiments demonstrating higher solution accuracy and faster compute times compared to vanilla PINNs.\\nAn improved interpretability through access to a symbolic decomposition of the solution.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'The main focus of this article is to solve initial-boundary-value problems (IBVPs) effectively by using machine learning techniques. We will introduce IBVPs in section 2.2 along with their associated partial differential equations (PDEs) ( section 2.1 ), while placing a particular emphasis on their symmetries in section 2.3 . For readers seeking a quick overview, we recommend focusing on section 2.3 . A more comprehensive description of the topics discussed will be compiled in section A.1 . For a detailed exploration of these subjects, we refer to [ 31 ] as an extensive standard source, [ 30 , 3 , 2 ] for alternative presentations, [ 10 ] for a focus on Lie groups, and [ 27 ] for an overview, including a historical perspective.\\nIn a nutshell, PDEs are just equations containing derivatives. When studying symmetries of PDEs, it is often convenient to think of their solutions as parametrized surfaces, instead of functions, which enables a geometric treatment. In the following, we develop this idea rigorously and introduce the key concepts. This summary is oriented towards the description in [ 31 ] . For a more general perspective on PDEs we recommend [ 34 , 16 , 11 , 29 ] .\\nConsider n n independent variables x = ( x 1 , … , x n ) ∈ X = ℝ n x=(x_{1},\\\\ldots,x_{n})\\\\in X=\\\\mathbb{R}^{n} and m m dependent variables u = ( u 1 , … , u m ) ∈ 𝒰 = ℝ m u=(u^{1},\\\\ldots,u^{m})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}=\\\\mathbb{R}^{m} . This terminology reflects that we will later treat solutions as maps from X X to 𝒰 \\\\mathcal{U} . In addition to the dependent and independent variables, the PDE also contains derivatives. Therefore, we denote by d ∈ ℕ d\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} the order of the considered PDE, i.e., the order of its highest derivative. For n n independent variables, the number of distinct partial derivatives up to order d d is given 1 1 1 We will always assume smooth functions, such that derivatives will commute. The number of partial derivatives follows from the combinatorial identity ∑ i = 0 d ( n + i − 1 i ) = ( n + d d ) \\\\sum_{i=0}^{d}\\\\binom{n+i-1}{i}=\\\\binom{n+d}{d} for d ≥ 0 d\\\\geq 0 and n > 0 n>0 , which can be easily shown by induction. by ( n + d d ) \\\\binom{n+d}{d} . We prolong the space 𝒰 \\\\mathcal{U} to include all partial derivatives up to order d d , which we denote by 𝒰 ( d ) := ℝ m \\u200b ( n + d d ) \\\\mathcal{U}^{(d)}:=\\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\binom{n+d}{d}} . By these definitions, a system of p p PDEs of order d d is given as a set of equations\\nwhere we assume 𝒟 : X × 𝒰 ( d ) → ℝ p \\\\mathcal{D}:X\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}^{(d)}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{p} to be smooth. Accordingly, we describe PDEs as functions of the independent variables and the prolonged dependent variables.\\nIn order to connect the placeholder variable u ( d ) u^{(d)} to the actual derivatives, we introduce the prolongation of functions. For a sufficiently smooth function f : Ω → 𝒰 f:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathcal{U} with Ω ⊆ X \\\\Omega\\\\subseteq X open, its d d -th prolongation pr ( d ) \\u2061 f : Ω → 𝒰 ( d ) \\\\operatorname{pr}^{(d)}f:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathcal{U}^{(d)} is defined as the tuple\\nwhere [ n ] d := { σ ⊆ { 1 , … , n } : | σ | ≤ d } [n]^{d}:=\\\\big\\\\{\\\\sigma\\\\subseteq\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\}:|\\\\sigma|\\\\leq d\\\\big\\\\} contains all subsets of [ n ] [n] with at most d d elements (including the empty set), and we write for a set J = { j 1 , … , j k } J=\\\\{j_{1},\\\\ldots,j_{k}\\\\}\\nfor brevity. Thus, the prolongation explicitly lists all derivatives up to order d d . For instance, for a function f : ℝ 2 → ℝ f:\\\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} we get pr ( 2 ) f ( x , y ) = ( f , f x , f y , \\\\operatorname{pr}^{(2)}f(x,y)=\\\\bigl(f,f_{x},f_{y}, f x \\u200b x , f x \\u200b y , f y \\u200b y ) ∈ 𝒰 ( 2 ) ≅ ℝ 6 f_{xx},f_{xy},f_{yy}\\\\bigr)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{U}^{(2)}\\\\cong\\\\mathbb{R}^{6} .\\nA sufficiently smooth function f : Ω → 𝒰 f:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathcal{U} , with Ω ⊆ X \\\\Omega\\\\subseteq X open, is called a solution of the PDE system 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} if\\nIt is important to note, that there is no general theory to find solutions of PDEs. However, for the further treatment, it is useful to classify PDEs with respect to their properties. We call a PDE (system) 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} linear if we can write it in the form\\nfor some functions h , a J : X → ℝ p h,a_{J}:X\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{p} . If in addition h \\u200b ( x ) ≡ 0 h(x)\\\\equiv 0 , we call the PDE (system) linear homogeneous . For any linear homogeneous PDEs, we have that if f 1 f_{1} and f 2 f_{2} are two solutions of the PDE, then so is α \\u200b f 1 + β \\u200b f 2 \\\\alpha f_{1}+\\\\beta f_{2} for any α , β ∈ ℝ \\\\alpha,\\\\beta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} . In particular, it holds that f \\u200b ( x ) ≡ 0 f(x)\\\\equiv 0 is always a solution for any linear homogeneous PDE. If a linear homogeneous PDE does not contain a term depending on u u , it additionally is true that every constant function solves this PDE.\\nSince PDEs usually admit infinitely many solutions, we impose additional constraints in the form of initial-boundary conditions (IBC) to ensure uniqueness. To simplify the notation, we will not explicitly distinguish between time and spatial coordinates. Hence, initial and boundary conditions get the same form. Let Ω ⊂ X \\\\Omega\\\\subset X be a bounded domain, where its boundary ∂ Ω \\\\partial\\\\Omega contains smooth, connected components Γ 1 , … , Γ r ⊆ ∂ Ω \\\\Gamma_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\Gamma_{r}\\\\subseteq\\\\partial\\\\Omega . For each Γ k \\\\Gamma_{k} , we introduce a condition of the form\\nwith ℬ k : Γ k × 𝒰 × 𝒰 → ℝ \\\\mathcal{B}_{k}:\\\\Gamma_{k}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} . The symbol u 𝒏 u_{\\\\bm{n}} is a placeholder, which will later be associated with the normal derivative. A PDE system 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} together with associated IBCs ℬ 1 , … , ℬ r \\\\mathcal{B}_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathcal{B}_{r} defines an initial-boundary value problem (IBVP). A sufficiently smooth function f : Ω ¯ → 𝒰 f:\\\\overline{\\\\Omega}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{U} is called a solution of the IBVP if\\nwhere d \\u200b f d \\u200b 𝒏 \\u200b ( x ) = ∇ f \\u200b ( x ) ⋅ n ^ \\u200b ( x ) \\\\frac{\\\\mathop{}\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}f}{\\\\mathop{}\\\\!\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\bm{n}}(x)=\\\\nabla f(x)\\\\cdot\\\\hat{n}(x) is the normal outward derivative on Γ k \\\\Gamma_{k} .\\nIn the following, we will always focus on well-posed IBVPs, meaning that (i) the IBVP has a solution, (ii) the solution is unique, and (iii) the solution depends continuously on the prescribed initial and boundary data. The precise definition of these three properties depends on the specific problem being considered, and there is no commonly agreed definition, as noted in [ 16 ] . Typically, we restrict the space of possible solutions to smooth functions and may add further restrictions, e.g., certain assumptions on the growth at infinity, in order to specify uniqueness. To illustrate the last condition in practice, we give the following example.\\nConsider the two IBVPs of the so-called reverse heat equation in the domain x ∈ [ 0 , 2 \\u200b π ) x\\\\in[0,2\\\\pi) , t > 0 t>0 with\\nwith ϵ > 0 \\\\epsilon>0 . It is not hard to verify the two solutions u \\u200b ( x , t ) ≡ 0 u(x,t)\\\\equiv 0 and v \\u200b ( x , t ) = ϵ \\u200b sin \\u2061 ( x ) \\u200b e t v(x,t)=\\\\epsilon\\\\sin(x)e^{t} . These two problems only differ in the initial condition, having the distance ‖ u \\u200b ( 0 ) − v \\u200b ( 0 ) ‖ ∞ = ϵ \\\\left\\\\|u(0)-v(0)\\\\right\\\\|_{\\\\infty}=\\\\epsilon , with the norm ‖ f \\u200b ( t ) ‖ ∞ := max x ∈ [ 0 , 2 \\u200b π ) \\u2061 | f \\u200b ( x , t ) | \\\\left\\\\|f(t)\\\\right\\\\|_{\\\\infty}:=\\\\max_{x\\\\in[0,2\\\\pi)}|f(x,t)| . Hence, the initial conditions are arbitrary close for small ϵ \\\\epsilon . However, the distance between solutions is given by ‖ u \\u200b ( t ) − v \\u200b ( t ) ‖ ∞ = ϵ \\u200b e t \\\\left\\\\|u(t)-v(t)\\\\right\\\\|_{\\\\infty}=\\\\epsilon\\\\ e^{t} , which is not bounded on the domain. Hence, the solution will not depend continuously on the initial data, and this problem is ill-posed.\\nIn comparison, consider a slightly modified version of the problem (heat equation)\\nwhich results in the solutions u \\u200b ( x , t ) ≡ 0 u(x,t)\\\\equiv 0 and v \\u200b ( x , t ) = ϵ \\u200b sin \\u2061 ( x ) \\u200b e − t v(x,t)=\\\\epsilon\\\\sin(x)e^{-t} . In that case, the distance between the solutions is given by ‖ u \\u200b ( t ) − v \\u200b ( t ) ‖ ∞ = ϵ \\u200b e − t ≤ ϵ \\\\left\\\\|u(t)-v(t)\\\\right\\\\|_{\\\\infty}=\\\\epsilon\\\\ e^{-t}\\\\leq\\\\epsilon . Hence, the map from initial data to solutions is (locally) Lipschitz continuous\\nwith Lipschitz constant C = 1 C=1 . Hence, we confirmed the well-posedness of the heat equation with Dirichlet conditions.\\nPDEs can be invariant under certain symmetries, and so their set of solutions has to respect the same symmetries. Let us illustrate this behaviour on the differential equation u x \\u200b x = 0 u_{xx}=0 . Obviously, if u = f \\u200b ( x ) u=f(x) is a solution, then so is u = f \\u200b ( x ) + ϑ u=f(x)+\\\\vartheta , as well as u = e ϑ \\u200b f \\u200b ( x ) u=e^{\\\\vartheta}f(x) for any ϑ ∈ ℝ \\\\vartheta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} . Hence, the underlying PDE comes with a translation and scaling invariance\\nMoreover, these symmetry transformations will generate a group structure, i.e., we have a neutral element T 0 i = e T^{i}_{0}=e , inversions ( T ϑ i ) − 1 = T − ϑ i \\\\big(T^{i}_{\\\\vartheta}\\\\big)^{-1}=T^{i}_{-\\\\vartheta} and T ϑ 1 i ∘ T ϑ 2 i = T ϑ 1 + ϑ 2 i T^{i}_{\\\\vartheta_{1}}\\\\circ T^{i}_{\\\\vartheta_{2}}=T^{i}_{\\\\vartheta_{1}+\\\\vartheta_{2}} . Thus, we obtain a two-dimensional group, which is spanned by two one-parameter groups.\\nThe rigorous study of these symmetry groups naturally leads to the framework of Lie groups [ 10 ] , which provide the mathematical structure for continuous transformation groups. A Lie group is a smooth, finite-dimensional manifold endowed with a group structure 2 2 2 A group ( G , ⋅ ) (G,\\\\cdot) is a set G G equipped with a binary operation ⋅ : G × G → G \\\\cdot:G\\\\times G\\\\to G that is associative, has a unique identity element e ∈ G e\\\\in G , and assigns to each g ∈ G g\\\\in G a unique inverse g − 1 g^{-1} . such that both the multiplication and inversion maps are smooth.\\nSymmetry transformations can be described as actions of the Lie groups on manifolds. For a Lie group G G and a smooth manifold M M , this action ∘ : G × M → M \\\\circ:G\\\\times M\\\\to M is required to be compatible with the group axioms, i.e., we demand g 1 ∘ ( g 2 ∘ x ) = ( g 1 ⋅ g 2 ) ∘ x g_{1}\\\\circ(g_{2}\\\\circ x)=(g_{1}\\\\cdot g_{2})\\\\circ x and e ∘ x = x e\\\\circ x=x for any g 1 , g 2 ∈ G g_{1},g_{2}\\\\in G and all x ∈ M x\\\\in M .\\nDepending on the group G G and the manifold M M , not all of these actions may be defined, which is why we allow restricting these actions to a subset 𝒰 ⊆ G × M \\\\mathscr{U}\\\\subseteq G\\\\times M containing the identity { e } × M ⊆ 𝒰 \\\\{e\\\\}\\\\times M\\\\subseteq\\\\mathscr{U} . We will call this restriction a local group of transformations . Note that this restriction to group elements around the identity do not pose any serious limitations, since every element of the full Lie group G G can be written as a finite product of elements which are close to the identity (compare [ 31 , thm. 1.22 and prop. 1.24] ).\\nIn order to connect a PDE solution to a manifold, let f : Ω → 𝒰 f:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathcal{U} be a sufficiently smooth function with Ω ⊆ X \\\\Omega\\\\subseteq X . Its graph is defined as\\na smooth submanifold of X × 𝒰 X\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U} . If G G is a (local) group of transformations acting on X × 𝒰 X\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U} , then for g ∈ G g\\\\in G we define the transformed graph as\\nIn the case where we can write the transformed graph g ∘ Γ f = Γ f ~ g\\\\circ\\\\Gamma_{f}=\\\\Gamma_{\\\\tilde{f}} as a graph of another function f ~ \\\\tilde{f} , we simply write f ~ = g ∘ f \\\\tilde{f}=g\\\\circ f . Note that for elements g g close to the identity, we always find a (single-valued) function f ~ \\\\tilde{f} with that property.\\nA symmetry group of a PDE 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} is a local group of transformations G G acting on M ⊆ X × 𝒰 ( d ) M\\\\subseteq X\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}^{(d)} , such that whenever u = f \\u200b ( x ) u=f(x) is a solution of 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} , and g ∘ f g\\\\circ f is defined for g ∈ G g\\\\in G , then u = g ∘ f \\u200b ( x ) u=g\\\\circ f(x) will be a solution of 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} as well.\\nTo illustrate these concepts, we discuss the symmetry group of the 1 1 -dimensional heat equation. We will provide a discussion on how to actually compute these symmetry groups in examples A.2 , A.3 and A.4 .\\nConsider the heat equation\\nwhere n = 2 n=2 , d = 2 d=2 , m = 1 m=1 and p = 1 p=1 . It admits the following six one-parameter symmetry transformations [ 31 ] :\\nfor any ϑ ∈ Θ ⊆ ℝ \\\\vartheta\\\\in\\\\Theta\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R} . Note that, we can use different values ϑ \\\\vartheta for any of these transformations, and that – depending on the domain Ω \\\\Omega of f f – we may resctrict the domain for T 6 T^{6} to Θ ⊆ ℝ \\\\Theta\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R} , to avoid singularities. In addition, there is an additional symmetry transformation, reflecting the linearity, i.e., for any solution α \\u200b ( x , t ) \\\\alpha(x,t) of equation 17 , we have the symmetry\\nHence, for any solution u = f \\u200b ( x , t ) u=f(x,t) of the heat equation equation 17 , applying any of the aforementioned transformations produces another possible solution. As an example, for the constant solution f \\u200b ( x , t ) ≡ 1 f(x,t)\\\\equiv 1 and after applying the transformation T ϑ 6 T^{6}_{\\\\vartheta} , obtains the function u = 1 1 + 4 \\u200b ϑ \\u200b t \\u200b exp \\u2061 ( − ϑ \\u200b x 2 1 + 4 \\u200b ϑ \\u200b t ) u=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+4\\\\vartheta t}}\\\\exp\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{-\\\\vartheta x^{2}}{1+4\\\\vartheta t}\\\\right) that also solves the heat equation, whenever this function is defined, i.e. for 1 + 4 \\u200b ϑ \\u200b t ≠ 0 1+4\\\\vartheta t\\\\neq 0 .\\nWhile the transformations T 1 , … , T 4 T^{1},\\\\ldots,T^{4} in example 2.2 can be found by carefully observing the differential equation equation 17 , T 5 T^{5} and T 6 T^{6} are far from being trivial to be obtained by reading the PDE. However, there exists a concrete recipe for how to compute these transformations, which we will summarize in section A.1 . There are also plenty of implementations for the computation of Lie symmetries, and we refer to [ 28 ] for a current approach, and [ 36 , 14 , 6 , 7 ] for an overview about different implementations.',\n",

Thus, the prolongation explicitly lists all derivatives up to order d d .

The precise definition of these three properties depends on the specific problem being considered, and there is no commonly agreed definition, as noted in [ 16 ] . Typically, we restrict the space of possible solutions to smooth functions and may add further restrictions, e.g., certain assumptions on the growth at infinity, in order to specify uniqueness. To illustrate the last condition in practice, we give the following example.\\nConsider the two IBVPs of the so-called reverse heat equation in the domain x ∈ [ 0 , 2 \\u200b π ) x\\\\in[0,2\\\\pi) , t > 0 t>0 with\\nwith ϵ > 0 \\\\epsilon>0 .

These two problems only differ in the initial condition, having the distance ‖ u \\u200b ( 0 ) − v \\u200b ( 0 ) ‖ ∞ = ϵ \\\\left\\\\|u(0)-v(0)\\\\right\\\\|_{\\\\infty}=\\\\epsilon , with the norm ‖ f \\u200b ( t ) ‖ ∞ := max x ∈ [ 0 , 2 \\u200b π ) \\u2061 | f \\u200b ( x , t ) | \\\\left\\\\|f(t)\\\\right\\\\|_{\\\\infty}:=\\\\max_{x\\\\in[0,2\\\\pi)}|f(x,t)| .

Hence, the solution will not depend continuously on the initial data, and this problem is ill-posed.\\nIn comparison, consider a slightly modified version of the problem (heat equation)\\nwhich results in the solutions u \\u200b ( x , t ) ≡ 0 u(x,t)\\\\equiv 0 and v \\u200b ( x , t ) = ϵ \\u200b sin \\u2061 ( x ) \\u200b e − t v(x,t)=\\\\epsilon\\\\sin(x)e^{-t} .

Hence, the underlying PDE comes with a translation and scaling invariance\\nMoreover, these symmetry transformations will generate a group structure, i.e., we have a neutral element T 0 i = e T^{i}_{0}=e , inversions ( T ϑ i ) − 1 = T − ϑ i \\\\big(T^{i}_{\\\\vartheta}\\\\big)^{-1}=T^{i}_{-\\\\vartheta} and T ϑ 1 i ∘ T ϑ 2 i = T ϑ 1 + ϑ 2 i T^{i}_{\\\\vartheta_{1}}\\\\circ T^{i}_{\\\\vartheta_{2}}=T^{i}_{\\\\vartheta_{1}+\\\\vartheta_{2}} . Thus, we obtain a two-dimensional group, which is spanned by two one-parameter groups.\\nThe rigorous study of these symmetry groups naturally leads to the framework of Lie groups [ 10 ] , which provide the mathematical structure for continuous transformation groups. A Lie group is a smooth, finite-dimensional manifold endowed with a group structure 2 2 2 A group ( G , ⋅ ) (G,\\\\cdot) is a set G G equipped with a binary operation ⋅ : G × G → G \\\\cdot:G\\\\times G\\\\to G that is associative, has a unique identity element e ∈ G e\\\\in G , and assigns to each g ∈ G g\\\\in G a unique inverse g − 1 g^{-1} . such that both the multiplication and inversion maps are smooth.\\nSymmetry transformations can be described as actions of the Lie groups on manifolds. For a Lie group G G and a smooth manifold M M , this action ∘ : G × M → M \\\\circ:G\\\\times M\\\\to M is required to be compatible with the group axioms, i.e., we demand g 1 ∘ ( g 2 ∘ x ) = ( g 1 ⋅ g 2 ) ∘ x g_{1}\\\\circ(g_{2}\\\\circ x)=(g_{1}\\\\cdot g_{2})\\\\circ x and e ∘ x = x e\\\\circ x=x for any g 1 , g 2 ∈ G g_{1},g_{2}\\\\in G and all x ∈ M x\\\\in M .\\nDepending on the group G G and the manifold M M , not all of these actions may be defined, which is why we allow restricting these actions to a subset 𝒰 ⊆ G × M \\\\mathscr{U}\\\\subseteq G\\\\times M containing the identity { e } × M ⊆ 𝒰 \\\\{e\\\\}\\\\times M\\\\subseteq\\\\mathscr{U} . We will call this restriction a local group of transformations . Note that this restriction to group elements around the identity do not pose any serious limitations, since every element of the full Lie group G G can be written as a finite product of elements which are close to the identity (compare [ 31 , thm. 1.22 and prop. 1.24] ).\\nIn order to connect a PDE solution to a manifold, let f : Ω → 𝒰 f:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathcal{U} be a sufficiently smooth function with Ω ⊆ X \\\\Omega\\\\subseteq X .

We will provide a discussion on how to actually compute these symmetry groups in examples A.2 , A.3 and A.4 .\\nConsider the heat equation\\nwhere n = 2 n=2 , d = 2 d=2 , m = 1 m=1 and p = 1 p=1 . It admits the following six one-parameter symmetry transformations [ 31 ] :\\nfor any ϑ ∈ Θ ⊆ ℝ \\\\vartheta\\\\in\\\\Theta\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R} .

In addition, there is an additional symmetry transformation, reflecting the linearity, i.e., for any solution α \\u200b ( x , t ) \\\\alpha(x,t) of equation 17 , we have the symmetry\\nHence, for any solution u = f \\u200b ( x , t ) u=f(x,t) of the heat equation equation 17 , applying any of the aforementioned transformations produces another possible solution.

However, there exists a concrete recipe for how to compute these transformations, which we will summarize in section A.1 .

       "    'paragraphs': 'In this section, we introduce LieSolver , a solver for IBVPs of linear homogeneous PDEs that enforces the PDE exactly by construction. The model is a linear combination of functions generated by parameterized Lie-symmetry transformations. Since each term satisfies the PDE, optimization reduces to fitting initial and boundary conditions. We formalize this construction and the IBC loss in section 3.1 , and outline the optimization algorithm, which includes greedy term selection, variable projection for linear coefficients, and nonlinear least squares for transformation parameters, in section 3.2 .\\nLet 𝒟 \\u200b ( x , u ( d ) ) = 0 \\\\mathcal{D}(x,u^{(d)})=0 denote a linear homogeneous PDE and let f : Ω → 𝒰 f:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathcal{U} be a solution of this PDE. As discussed in section 2.3 , a Lie symmetry T ϑ T_{\\\\vartheta} of 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} is a smooth, invertible transformation, parametrized by ϑ ∈ Θ ⊆ ℝ \\\\vartheta\\\\in\\\\Theta\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R} , with the property that transforming the solution with T ϑ T_{\\\\vartheta} yields another solution of the PDE 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} . In particular, as noted in section 2.1 any linear homogeneous PDE will have the following symmetry:\\nwhere x ∈ X x\\\\in X , ϑ ∈ ℝ \\\\vartheta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} and α : Ω → 𝒰 \\\\alpha:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathcal{U} is an arbitrary solution of the PDE. In different terms, for any linear homogeneous PDE, the linear combination of solutions is a solution as well, which is also known as the superposition principle.\\nSince Lie symmetries form a group, concatenating different Lie symmetries yields another valid Lie symmetry. Thus, given a solution, one can generate a family of new solutions by successive applications of these transformations. Finding an initial solution is often straightforward. For instance, any linear homogeneous PDE admits the trivial f \\u200b ( x ) ≡ 0 f(x)\\\\equiv 0 solution. In addition, a constant function solves every linear homogeneous PDE without a term containing u u , e.g. f \\u200b ( x ) ≡ 1 f(x)\\\\equiv 1 is a solution for heat equation, Laplace equation and wave equation. We refer to such solutions as seed solutions , denoted f seed f_{\\\\text{seed}} , and they are typically easy to obtain for a given PDE.\\nHence, when starting with one or several seed solutions and applying various Lie transformations, the resulting functions will still constitute exact solutions of the PDE. This reveals a remarkable fact: a single seed solution, together with the action of a Lie group, can define expressive solution (sub)spaces via superposition. We illustrate this in the following example.\\nConsider the following seed solution of the heat equation equation 17 :\\nApplying the transformation T ϑ 4 T^{4}_{\\\\vartheta} from example 2.2 with ϑ = − ln \\u2061 λ \\\\vartheta=-\\\\ln\\\\lambda , one obtains the family of solution sin \\u2061 ( λ \\u200b x ) \\u200b e − λ 2 \\u200b t \\\\sin(\\\\lambda x)e^{-\\\\lambda^{2}t} for any λ > 0 \\\\lambda>0 .\\nIt is a well-known result [ 4 , sec. 10.5] that the IBVP for the heat equation u t = u x \\u200b x u_{t}=u_{xx} on ( 0 , L ) (0,L) with u \\u200b ( 0 , t ) = u \\u200b ( L , t ) = 0 u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0 and u \\u200b ( x , 0 ) = ∑ n = 1 ∞ a n \\u200b sin \\u2061 ( n \\u200b π \\u200b x / L ) u(x,0)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}a_{n}\\\\sin\\\\!\\\\big(n\\\\pi x/L\\\\big) admits the unique solution u \\u200b ( x , t ) = ∑ n = 1 ∞ a n \\u200b sin \\u2061 ( n \\u200b π \\u200b x / L ) \\u200b e − ( n \\u200b π / L ) 2 \\u200b t u(x,t)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}a_{n}\\\\sin\\\\!\\\\big(n\\\\pi x/L\\\\big)\\\\,e^{-(n\\\\pi/L)^{2}t} . Hence, even with one specific Lie transformation, we can approximate a certain type of IBVP arbitrary well.\\nThus, by applying a sequence of Lie symmetries T l T^{l} to a given f seed f_{\\\\text{seed}} , we obtain an expressive function\\nthat remains a solution of the underlying PDE 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} for any value of ϑ = ( ϑ 1 , … , ϑ k ) ∈ ℝ k \\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}=(\\\\vartheta_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\vartheta_{k})\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{k} , whenever the composed function is defined.\\nIn the approach of LieSolver , we consider a set 𝒮 = { f 1 \\u200b ( x ; ϑ 1 ) , … , f N \\u200b ( x ; ϑ N ) } \\\\mathcal{S}=\\\\{f^{1}(x;\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}^{1}),\\\\ldots,f^{N}(x;\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}^{N})\\\\} of expressive functions, where each function f i f^{i} is constructed from one or several seed solutions in the form of equation 27 . We refer to these functions as base solutions 3 3 3 We borrow this term from the Finite Element Method. However, this set will not necessarily be minimal, but we will span a solution-(sub)space by these “base solutions”. . We will discuss in section 3.2 more in detail, how to choose “good” base solutions for a given problem.\\nThe central idea of LieSolver is to choose certain base solution and combine them linearly. In this procedure we can also use the same base solution several times with different parameters, i.e.\\nwhich constitutes a very expressive function covering a major part of the solution space of the PDE. When the parameters ϑ i j i \\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}_{i}^{j_{i}} are specified to certain values ϑ ^ i j i \\\\hat{\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}}_{i}^{j_{i}} , we will call the collection of base solutions appearing in equation 28 the active set 𝒜 = { f 1 j 1 \\u200b ( x ; ϑ ^ 1 j 1 ) , … , f M j M \\u200b ( x ; ϑ ^ M j M ) } \\\\mathcal{A}=\\\\{f_{1}^{j_{1}}(x;\\\\hat{\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}}_{1}^{j_{1}}),\\\\ldots,f_{M}^{j_{M}}(x;\\\\hat{\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}}_{M}^{j_{M}})\\\\} . Note that each ϑ i j i \\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}_{i}^{j_{i}} may possibly consist of several parameters as given in equation 27 . To shorten the notation, we write θ = ( ϑ 1 j 1 , … , ϑ M j M ) \\\\theta=(\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}_{1}^{j_{1}},\\\\ldots,\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}_{M}^{j_{M}}) and 𝒂 = ( a 1 , … , a M ) \\\\bm{a}=(a_{1},\\\\ldots,a_{M}) . Since f LS f_{\\\\text{LS}} is a solution of the PDE by construction , the problem of finding a solution to the IBVP is reduced to match given initial and/or boundary conditions ℬ 1 , … , ℬ r \\\\mathcal{B}_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathcal{B}_{r} , i.e. finding the optimal set of parameters 𝒂 \\\\bm{a} and θ \\\\theta .

Consequently, boundary conditions ℬ 1 , … , ℬ r \\\\mathcal{B}_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathcal{B}_{r} define set of target values 𝒴 ∈ ℝ L × m \\\\mathcal{Y}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L\\\\times m} at datapoints 𝒳 \\\\mathcal{X} .\\nThe seed solutions, the chosen transformations applied to them, and the number of base solutions are design choices of the model. The amplitudes 𝒂 \\\\bm{a} and transformation parameters θ \\\\theta serve as the optimizable parameters.\\nLieSolver determines an optimal linear combination f LS \\u200b ( x ; 𝒂 , θ ) = ∑ i a i \\u200b f i j i \\u200b ( x ; ϑ i j i ) f_{\\\\text{LS}}(x;\\\\bm{a},\\\\theta)=\\\\sum_{i}a_{i}\\\\,f^{j_{i}}_{i}(x;\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}^{j_{i}}_{i}) via two stages. First, LieSolver employs greedy addition of the base solutions f i j i \\u200b ( x ; ϑ i j i ) f^{j_{i}}_{i}(x;\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}^{j_{i}}_{i}) ; it appends the active set 𝒜 \\\\mathcal{A} with the base solution with the largest absolute cosine similarity to the current residual\\nand updates amplitudes 𝒂 \\\\bm{a} with ridge least squares (LS). Here, f LS \\u200b ( 𝒳 ; 𝒂 , θ ) f_{\\\\text{LS}}(\\\\mathcal{X};\\\\bm{a},\\\\theta) is to be understood as the natural extension of equation 28 to 𝒳 \\\\mathcal{X} . Second, it employs variable projection to eliminate the linear amplitudes 𝒂 \\\\bm{a} and periodically refine only the nonlinear parameters θ \\\\theta with nonlinear least squares (NLLS).\\nBy employing variable projection [ 12 , 26 ] , we eliminate the amplitudes 𝒂 \\\\bm{a} by solving the LS subproblem exactly for fixed θ \\\\theta ,\\nwhere f LS \\u200b ( 𝒳 ; 𝒂 , θ ) f_{\\\\text{LS}}(\\\\mathcal{X};\\\\bm{a},\\\\theta) is represented as the matrix-vector product with the matrix F \\u200b ( θ ) = [ f i j i \\u200b ( 𝒳 ; ϑ i j i ) ] i = 1 M F(\\\\theta)=[\\\\,f^{j_{i}}_{i}(\\\\mathcal{X};\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}^{j_{i}}_{i})\\\\,]_{i=1}^{M} and λ > 0 \\\\lambda>0 is the ridge parameter. Substituting 𝒂 ⋆ \\u200b ( θ ) \\\\bm{a}^{\\\\star}(\\\\theta) back into minimization objective yields the reduced problem:\\nwhich we minimize over allowed values of θ \\\\theta with NLLS 4 4 4 https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html , specifically with bound-constrained trust-region reflective least squares. This reduces the optimization dimension to the nonlinear parameters, improves conditioning by solving the linear part exactly at each step, and stabilizes training.\\nThe initial catalogue of bases 𝒮 \\\\mathcal{S} determines the expressivity of the constructed solution, and thus is crucial for performance. The bases should reproduce a wide range of patterns expected under the given PDE and initial-boundary data. Further, the parameter bounds and the chosen sampling rule (uniform or log-uniform) should cover relevant scales.\\nFor example, for the heat equation, the effective choice includes scaled/shifted Fourier modes from a seed solution like sin \\u2061 ( x ) \\u200b e − t \\\\sin(x)e^{-t} , Gaussian blobs generated from a constant seed solution by applying diffusion/shift, and a hybrid that combines both behaviours.\\nIn conclusion to the details discussed above, we present the specific algorithm for LieSolver , which depends on the following inputs:\\nTraining data 𝒳 ⊂ ∂ Ω ∈ ℝ L × n \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\subset\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L\\\\times n} (rows are points x ∈ ℝ n x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n} ) and targets 𝒴 ∈ ℝ L × m \\\\mathcal{Y}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L\\\\times m} on the IBC set.\\nA set of base solutions 𝒮 = { f 1 \\u200b ( x ; ϑ 1 ) , … , f N \\u200b ( x ; ϑ N ) } \\\\mathcal{S}=\\\\{f^{1}(x;\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}^{1}),\\\\ldots,f^{N}(x;\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}^{N})\\\\} .

We illustrate this in the following example.\\nConsider the following seed solution of the heat equation equation 17 :\\nApplying the transformation T ϑ 4 T^{4}_{\\\\vartheta} from example 2.2 with ϑ = − ln \\u2061 λ \\\\vartheta=-\\\\ln\\\\lambda , one obtains the family of solution sin \\u2061 ( λ \\u200b x ) \\u200b e − λ 2 \\u200b t \\\\sin(\\\\lambda x)e^{-\\\\lambda^{2}t} for any λ > 0 \\\\lambda>0 .\\nIt is a well-known result [ 4 , sec. 10.5] that the IBVP for the heat equation u t = u x \\u200b x u_{t}=u_{xx} on ( 0 , L ) (0,L) with u \\u200b ( 0 , t ) = u \\u200b ( L , t ) = 0 u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0 and u \\u200b ( x , 0 ) = ∑ n = 1 ∞ a n \\u200b sin \\u2061 ( n \\u200b π \\u200b x / L ) u(x,0)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}a_{n}\\\\sin\\\\!\\\\big(n\\\\pi x/L\\\\big) admits the unique solution u \\u200b ( x , t ) = ∑ n = 1 ∞ a n \\u200b sin \\u2061 ( n \\u200b π \\u200b x / L ) \\u200b e − ( n \\u200b π / L ) 2 \\u200b t u(x,t)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}a_{n}\\\\sin\\\\!\\\\big(n\\\\pi x/L\\\\big)\\\\,e^{-(n\\\\pi/L)^{2}t} . Hence, even with one specific Lie transformation, we can approximate a certain type of IBVP arbitrary well.\\nThus, by applying a sequence of Lie symmetries T l T^{l} to a given f seed f_{\\\\text{seed}} , we obtain an expressive function\\nthat remains a solution of the underlying PDE 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} for any value of ϑ = ( ϑ 1 , … , ϑ k ) ∈ ℝ k \\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}=(\\\\vartheta_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\vartheta_{k})\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{k} , whenever the composed function is defined.\\nIn the approach of LieSolver , we consider a set 𝒮 = { f 1 \\u200b ( x ; ϑ 1 ) , … , f N \\u200b ( x ; ϑ N ) } \\\\mathcal{S}=\\\\{f^{1}(x;\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}^{1}),\\\\ldots,f^{N}(x;\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}^{N})\\\\} of expressive functions, where each function f i f^{i} is constructed from one or several seed solutions in the form of equation 27 . We refer to these functions as base solutions 3 3 3 We borrow this term from the Finite Element Method. However, this set will not necessarily be minimal, but we will span a solution-(sub)space by these “base solutions”. . We will discuss in section 3.2 more in detail, how to choose “good” base solutions for a given problem.\\nThe central idea of LieSolver is to choose certain base solution and combine them linearly. In this procedure we can also use the same base solution several times with different parameters, i.e.\\nwhich constitutes a very expressive function covering a major part of the solution space of the PDE. When the parameters ϑ i j i \\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}_{i}^{j_{i}} are specified to certain values ϑ ^ i j i \\\\hat{\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}}_{i}^{j_{i}} , we will call the collection of base solutions appearing in equation 28 the active set 𝒜 = { f 1 j 1 \\u200b ( x ; ϑ ^ 1 j 1 ) , … , f M j M \\u200b ( x ; ϑ ^ M j M ) } \\\\mathcal{A}=\\\\{f_{1}^{j_{1}}(x;\\\\hat{\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}}_{1}^{j_{1}}),\\\\ldots,f_{M}^{j_{M}}(x;\\\\hat{\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}}_{M}^{j_{M}})\\\\} . Note that each ϑ i j i \\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}_{i}^{j_{i}} may possibly consist of several parameters as given in equation 27 . To shorten the notation, we write θ = ( ϑ 1 j 1 , … , ϑ M j M ) \\\\theta=(\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}_{1}^{j_{1}},\\\\ldots,\\\\bm{\\\\vartheta}_{M}^{j_{M}}) and 𝒂 = ( a 1 , … , a M ) \\\\bm{a}=(a_{1},\\\\ldots,a_{M}) . Since f LS f_{\\\\text{LS}} is a solution of the PDE by construction , the problem of finding a solution to the IBVP is reduced to match given initial and/or boundary conditions ℬ 1 , … , ℬ r \\\\mathcal{B}_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathcal{B}_{r} , i.e. finding the optimal set of parameters 𝒂 \\\\bm{a} and θ \\\\theta . To formalize this, we introduce the loss function:\\nwhere 𝒳 k ⊂ Γ k \\\\mathcal{X}_{k}\\\\subset\\\\Gamma_{k} are finite sets of randomly sampled collocation points from the boundary parts Γ k ⊂ ∂ Ω \\\\Gamma_{k}\\\\subset\\\\partial\\\\Omega according to section 2.2 .\\nThe union 𝒳 = ⋃ k = 1 r 𝒳 k \\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\bigcup_{k=1}^{r}\\\\mathcal{X}_{k} forms the training dataset and consists of L L points 𝒳 ⊆ ℝ L × n \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^{L\\\\times n} (rows are individual points x ∈ ℝ n x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n} ).

Zero velocity IC enables us to use travelling blob pair instead of just one travelling blob.\\nWe use a standard fully connected neural network f PINN : ℝ 2 → ℝ f_{\\\\text{PINN}}:\\\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} with input ( x , t ) (x,t) , tanh \\\\tanh activation function and where the number of layers and their width is specified in table 2 in alignment with [ 40 ] . The loss combines the PDE residual, a several weighted IBC terms:\\nHere, 𝒳 r ⊂ Ω \\\\mathcal{X}_{r}\\\\subset\\\\Omega are the collocation points in the domain, while 𝒳 \\\\mathcal{X} and 𝒴 \\\\mathcal{Y} are the same sets of IBC points and targets used for LieSolver. The loss weight w ICBC w_{\\\\mathrm{ICBC}} is tuned to mitigate ill-conditioning and facilitate training (see table 2 ). We warm up with Adam for 1000 iterations and then train with L–BFGS until convergence or optimizer stall.\\nTable 1 summarizes representative runs of LieSolver for the considered IBVPs, while table 2 reports the corresponding PINN runs. For all ICs except the step IC, LieSolver reliably attains IBC MSE values of order 10 − 6 10^{-6} using between 5 5 and 40 40 bases. The step IC requires more bases due to its sharp jump. PINNs match LieSolver in terms of attained MSE only on the easiest cases, but falls short on the more challenging ICs. The sine mix IC requires a larger 6 × 100 6\\\\times 100 PINN. Notably, the step IC does not reach the target tolerance even with larger PINN models.\\nLieSolver is about one to two orders of magnitude faster than PINN across the considered cases. However, its runtime 5 5 5 All experiments were run on an Intel Core Ultra 7 165H CPU with 11 cores and 16\\u2009GiB RAM. increases sharply as the number of bases grows. Configurations with fewer than 20 20 bases train within 10 10 s, 40 40 bases – within 40 40 to 60 60 s, and around 80 80 bases take 200 200 to 300 300 s. This growth is determined by the global parameter refinement stage. More targeted refinement strategies could mitigate this bottleneck.\\nThe choice of base solutions strongly influences performance. Employing sine and Gaussian bases, LieSolver naturally fits IC profiles with similar sine and Gaussian patterns and reaches the target MSE in under a minute. The step IC remains a challenging stress test and highlights model capability. In the following, we discuss three representative cases that illustrate LieSolver behaviour.\\nFigure 3 shows the evolution of the IBC MSE as a function of the number of added bases. The greedy stage begins with a Gaussian base f 2 f^{2} that already captures most of the IC (MSE ∼ 10 − 3 \\\\sim 10^{-3} ), followed by several Fourier-like additions ( f 1 f^{1} and f 3 f^{3} ) that enforce the Dirichlet BCs. The first global refinement stage (after 5 bases) yields a one-order-of-magnitude drop in MSE; the target tolerance ( < 10 − 6 <10^{-6} ) is met after 11 bases. Details on performance metrics and computation are provided in table 1 . Moreover, we confirm the considerations from section 2.2 that there is an upper bound for the ratio between MSE on the domain and the test MSE on the IBCs as indicated in equation 13 . Hence, we show that the loss serves as a reliable metric for the overall domain accuracy.\\nFigure 4 and figure 5 compare the model prediction with the ground truth in the domain and on the IBCs, respectively. The IBC plots include a decomposition into the weighted base terms, revealing dominant Gaussian-like contributors for the IC profile and additional base terms that fit the BCs.\\nFor reference, a vanilla PINN also fits this smooth case to an IBC MSE < 10 − 6 <10^{-6} ( figure 6 ), albeit requiring a longer runtime, as indicated in table 2 .\\nThe step IC represents the most challenging case due to the jump in the profile. Figure 7 highlights three regimes of LieSolver optimization: (i) rapid improvement to MSE ≈ 10 − 4 \\\\approx 10^{-4} within 15 15 bases, (ii) a stall where additional bases bring limited improvement, and (iii) resumed progress after 40 40 bases culminating in < 10 − 5 <10^{-5} with 58 bases. Figures 8 and 9 show that the dominant residual is localized near the initial jump. Despite IBC MSE being higher than the target, the domain L2RE reaches 4.6 ⋅ 10 − 3 4.6\\\\cdot 10^{-3} , which is comparable to other IC cases. The decomposition in figure 9 is less interpretable than in the Gaussian case due to the large number modulated base contributions.\\nA standard PINN plateaus around 10 − 3 10^{-3} IBC MSE ( figure 10 ) and ∼ 10 − 1 \\\\sim 10^{-1} L2RE in the domain. The transition from an extremely sharp IC to a rapidly smoothening solution in the domain is hard for PINNs. Even larger networks fail to capture this dependency and underperform relative to the LieSolver .\\nFigure 11 illustrates effective handling of the challenging wave PDE with a sharp step IC by LieSolver . A Global parameter refinement at 60 and 80 base terms yields pronounced drops in MSE. With a sufficient number of active bases, the optimizer can adjust them effectively and achieve lower error. Figure 13 shows that the solution is primarily composed of Fourier sine modes with localized Gaussian corrections. During optimization, the greedy stage first selects sine bases to fit the dominant high-amplitude oscillatory component. As the remaining residual becomes localized and irregular, the algorithm increasingly adds Gaussian bases to correct for edges and boundary regions.\\nWith Gaussian bases, the residual is fitted in two steps. First, the model picks a positive pulse propagating into the domain. Second, it adds opposite-sign contributions to compensate for positive pulses at the boundaries and to reproduce the reflected wave (see the BC plots, middle and right subplots in figure 13 ). This structure is straightforward for the optimizer, and further MSE reduction is attainable with additional bases and parameters refinement. The domain plot is presented in figure 12 . The model achieves an L2RE of 5.1 ⋅ 10 − 3 5.1\\\\cdot 10^{-3} on the domain. The PINN handles the step IC better for the wave equation ( Figure 14 ) than for the heat equation ( Figure 10 ). The reason is that the wave PDE lacks parabolic smoothing; there is no abrupt transition from a sharp IC to a rapidly smoothed interior solution. Nevertheless, it does not resolve the sharp features sufficiently well and underperforms relative to LieSolver , achieving only an L2RE of 4.5 ⋅ 10 − 2 4.5\\\\cdot 10^{-2} in the domain.',\n",

For all ICs except the step IC, LieSolver reliably attains IBC MSE values of order 10 − 6 10^{-6} using between 5 5 and 40 40 bases. The step IC requires more bases due to its sharp jump. PINNs match LieSolver in terms of attained MSE only on the easiest cases, but falls short on the more challenging ICs. The sine mix IC requires a larger 6 × 100 6\\\\times 100 PINN. Notably, the step IC does not reach the target tolerance even with larger PINN models.\\nLieSolver is about one to two orders of magnitude faster than PINN across the considered cases. However, its runtime 5 5 5 All experiments were run on an Intel Core Ultra 7 165H CPU with 11 cores and 16\\u2009GiB RAM. increases sharply as the number of bases grows. Configurations with fewer than 20 20 bases train within 10 10 s, 40 40 bases – within 40 40 to 60 60 s, and around 80 80 bases take 200 200 to 300 300 s. This growth is determined by the global parameter refinement stage. More targeted refinement strategies could mitigate this bottleneck.\\nThe choice of base solutions strongly influences performance. Employing sine and Gaussian bases, LieSolver naturally fits IC profiles with similar sine and Gaussian patterns and reaches the target MSE in under a minute. The step IC remains a challenging stress test and highlights model capability. In the following, we discuss three representative cases that illustrate LieSolver behaviour.\\nFigure 3 shows the evolution of the IBC MSE as a function of the number of added bases. The greedy stage begins with a Gaussian base f 2 f^{2} that already captures most of the IC (MSE ∼ 10 − 3 \\\\sim 10^{-3} ), followed by several Fourier-like additions ( f 1 f^{1} and f 3 f^{3} ) that enforce the Dirichlet BCs. The first global refinement stage (after 5 bases) yields a one-order-of-magnitude drop in MSE; the target tolerance ( < 10 − 6 <10^{-6} ) is met after 11 bases. Details on performance metrics and computation are provided in table 1 . Moreover, we confirm the considerations from section 2.2 that there is an upper bound for the ratio between MSE on the domain and the test MSE on the IBCs as indicated in equation 13 . Hence, we show that the loss serves as a reliable metric for the overall domain accuracy.\\nFigure 4 and figure 5 compare the model prediction with the ground truth in the domain and on the IBCs, respectively. The IBC plots include a decomposition into the weighted base terms, revealing dominant Gaussian-like contributors for the IC profile and additional base terms that fit the BCs.\\nFor reference, a vanilla PINN also fits this smooth case to an IBC MSE < 10 − 6 <10^{-6} ( figure 6 ), albeit requiring a longer runtime, as indicated in table 2 .\\nThe step IC represents the most challenging case due to the jump in the profile. Figure 7 highlights three regimes of LieSolver optimization: (i) rapid improvement to MSE ≈ 10 − 4 \\\\approx 10^{-4} within 15 15 bases, (ii) a stall where additional bases bring limited improvement, and (iii) resumed progress after 40 40 bases culminating in < 10 − 5 <10^{-5} with 58 bases. Figures 8 and 9 show that the dominant residual is localized near the initial jump. Despite IBC MSE being higher than the target, the domain L2RE reaches 4.6 ⋅ 10 − 3 4.6\\\\cdot 10^{-3} , which is comparable to other IC cases.

The transition from an extremely sharp IC to a rapidly smoothening solution in the domain is hard for PINNs. Even larger networks fail to capture this dependency and underperform relative to the LieSolver .\\nFigure 11 illustrates effective handling of the challenging wave PDE with a sharp step IC by LieSolver . A Global parameter refinement at 60 and 80 base terms yields pronounced drops in MSE. With a sufficient number of active bases, the optimizer can adjust them effectively and achieve lower error. Figure 13 shows that the solution is primarily composed of Fourier sine modes with localized Gaussian corrections. During optimization, the greedy stage first selects sine bases to fit the dominant high-amplitude oscillatory component. As the remaining residual becomes localized and irregular, the algorithm increasingly adds Gaussian bases to correct for edges and boundary regions.\\nWith Gaussian bases, the residual is fitted in two steps.

Second, it adds opposite-sign contributions to compensate for positive pulses at the boundaries and to reproduce the reflected wave (see the BC plots, middle and right subplots in figure 13 ).

       "    'paragraphs': 'Using Lie symmetries, we generate parametrized functions that exactly solve the corresponding PDE. By incorporating the underlying symmetry structures directly into the model, solving initial-boundary value problems reduces to optimizing these parameters to satisfy the initial-boundary conditions (IBCs). Thus, for any parameter values, the model will solve the PDE by design. Focusing on the common case of linear homogeneous PDEs, we introduced LieSolver , which represents the solution as a linear combination of Lie-symmetry-generated base solutions whose linear amplitudes and symmetry parameters are learned from the IBCs. LieSolver constructs this representation incrementally by greedily adding the base function that yields the largest MSE reduction at each step. We use variable projection to eliminate the linear amplitudes via least squares (LS), yielding a reduced problem in the symmetry parameters, which we solve with a bound-constrained nonlinear least squares (NLLS).\\nThe most notable difference between PINNs [ 32 ] and our proposed method is that we incorporate PDEs into the model’s structure rather than including the PDE as a loss term in the optimization procedure. This approach offers several advantages: in our model, the loss function effectively serves as a faithful indicator of predictive accuracy, providing a reliable measure of the progress of training. Specifically, a decrease in the test loss – unlike in PINNs – always indicates an improvement in accuracy. In addition, this property implies the existence of rigorous error bounds for well-posed IBVPs.\\nMoreover, these tailor-made models use comparatively few parameters, which yields significant computational speedups without sacrificing expressivity. This also enables robust optimization with nonlinear least squares (NLLS), improving predictive accuracy. Across our benchmarks on 1D heat and wave equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions, LieSolver achieved IBC MSE below 10 − 6 10^{-6} with fewer than 40 40 bases (about 100 100 parameters) for smooth ICs and ran one to two orders of magnitude faster than PINNs. For the step IC with a sharp jump it required more bases yet still attained domain L2RE on the order of 10 − 3 10^{-3} , whereas PINNs plateaued between 10 − 2 10^{-2} and 10 − 1 10^{-1} ( tables 1 and 2 ). Furthermore, the compact models provably satisfy the underlying physics (that is, the PDE), which enables the prediction to be expressed as a sparse, analytical expression, thereby enhancing interpretability.\\nDespite the notable advantages of using Lie symmetries, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of our approach. Currently, LieSolver applies only to linear homogeneous PDEs. Although this encompasses a large class of important problems, we aim to generalize our framework in future work. Another drawback is that, for every PDE, the Lie symmetries and at least one seed solution must be derived. However, Lie symmetries can be determined algorithmically and for the most standard problems, they can also be found in the literature. Finding seed solutions is trivial for the class of linear homogeneous PDEs and remains feasible in more general cases.\\nA further weakness is that the performance of LieSolver heavily depends on the chosen set of base solutions, an aspect that requires further investigation to improve automatization.\\nHowever, as is the case in conventional neural networks, performance highly depends on various design choices. Nonetheless, in our approach, the loss constitutes a rigorous means to assess whether a particular choice of base solution is effective or needs to be extended, providing useful criteria for these design choices.\\nIt is also important to note that we have tested LieSolver only on a limited number of problems. Therefore, more extensive studies will be necessary in future work.\\nFrom the aforementioned, several next steps emerge naturally: a more detailed analysis of LieSolver on various problems, an automated selection of base solutions, as well as an extension to more general classes of PDEs. For the latter task, genetic algorithms appear to be a promising direction. By pursuing these steps, we aim to enhance the capabilities and applicability of LieSolver and provide an interpretable, reliable and efficient solver of IBVPs for general PDEs.\\nThe Python implementation is available at https://github.com/oduwancheekee/liesolver .\\nThe authors would like to thank Aleksander Krasowski, Théo Tyburn, Gleb Wassiltschuk and Moritz Weckbecker for helpful discussions.',\n",

In a final step, we would like to transfer this action onto the function itself. For simplicity, we will focus on the case where the action of the group element g ∈ G g\\\\in G takes the form ( x ~ , u ~ ) = g ∘ ( x , u ) = ( Ξ g \\u200b ( x ) , Φ g \\u200b ( x , u ) ) (\\\\tilde{x},\\\\tilde{u})=g\\\\circ(x,u)=(\\\\Xi_{g}(x),\\\\Phi_{g}(x,u)) , i.e., that the action of g g on x x will not depend on u u . For the general case, we refer to [ 31 , sec. 2.2] . In this particular case, we have x = Ξ g \\u200b ( x ~ ) − 1 = Ξ g − 1 \\u200b ( x ~ ) x=\\\\Xi_{g}(\\\\tilde{x})^{-1}=\\\\Xi_{g^{-1}}(\\\\tilde{x}) , and therefore\\nBy using equation 66 , we can relate the group actions from example A.3 to transformations of functions.

By applying equation 66 to the other groups G 2 , … , G 6 , G α G_{2},\\\\ldots,G_{6},G_{\\\\alpha} , we obtain the results presented in example 2.2 .\\nThus, we have a framework that, in principle, allows us to compute a symmetry group for any PDE system. For PDE systems with a certain additional property, we can give even a stronger statement. According to [ 31 , Def. 2.70] , a system of PDEs 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} is called local solvable at a point ( x 0 , u 0 ( d ) ) ∈ X × 𝒰 ( d ) (x_{0},u^{(d)}_{0})\\\\in X\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}^{(d)} , if there is a smooth solution u = f \\u200b ( x ) u=f(x) for x x in a neighbourhood of x 0 x_{0} , with u 0 ( d ) = pr ( d ) \\u2061 f \\u200b ( x 0 ) u_{0}^{(d)}=\\\\operatorname{pr}^{(d)}f(x_{0}) . The whole PDE system 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} is called locally solvable, if this property holds for any point ( x 0 , u 0 ( d ) ) (x_{0},u^{(d)}_{0}) satisfying 𝒟 \\u200b ( x 0 , u 0 ( d ) ) = 0 \\\\mathcal{D}(x_{0},u^{(d)}_{0})=0 . For a locally solvable system, we can give a sufficient and necessary description of symmetry groups:\\nLet 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} be a locally solvable system of PDEs with maximal rank defined over M ⊆ X × U M\\\\subseteq X\\\\times U and let G G be a local group of transformations acting on M M . G G is a symmetry group of 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} , if and only if\\nholds for any infinitesimal generator 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} of G G .\\nThus, for locally solvable systems, we can derive all symmetry groups of the PDE system with the aforementioned framework. We would like to conclude this section by recapping all the steps to compute the symmetry group:\\nCheck maximal rank and local solvability of 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} .\\nWrite an ansatz for a vector field 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} on X × 𝒰 X\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U} according to equation 42 and compute its prolongation equations 43 , 44 and 45 .\\nDerive the infinitesimal criterion theorems A.1 and A.5 , i.e., the prolongation of 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} applied on the PDE should vanish whenever the PDE is satisfied.\\nBy comparing the coefficients of the infinitesimal criterion, one obtains an overdetermined system of simple PDEs (“determining equations”).\\nSolve the determining equations by elementary methods, to get the most general generators 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} and choose a basis of the subspace generated by 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} .\\nDerive 1-parameter Lie groups from infinitesimal generators by the exponential map g ϑ ∘ ( x , u ) = exp \\u2061 ( ϑ \\u200b 𝐯 ) ∘ ( x , u ) g_{\\\\vartheta}\\\\circ(x,u)=\\\\exp(\\\\vartheta\\\\mathbf{v})\\\\circ(x,u) .\\nDerive the transformation maps from these group actions by equation 66 .\\nThere are several implementations available, which will solve this task step by step.

For the general case, we refer to [ 31 , sec. 2.2] . In this particular case, we have x = Ξ g \\u200b ( x ~ ) − 1 = Ξ g − 1 \\u200b ( x ~ ) x=\\\\Xi_{g}(\\\\tilde{x})^{-1}=\\\\Xi_{g^{-1}}(\\\\tilde{x}) , and therefore\\nBy using equation 66 , we can relate the group actions from example A.3 to transformations of functions. For example, for G 1 G_{1} we have Ξ g 1 , ϑ \\u200b ( x ) = x + ϑ \\\\Xi_{g_{1,\\\\vartheta}}(x)=x+\\\\vartheta and Φ g 1 , ϑ \\u200b ( x , u ) = u \\\\Phi_{g_{1,\\\\vartheta}}(x,u)=u . With Ξ g 1 , ϑ − 1 \\u200b ( x ) = Ξ g 1 , − ϑ \\u200b ( x ) = x − ϑ \\\\Xi_{g_{1,\\\\vartheta}^{-1}}(x)=\\\\Xi_{g_{1,-\\\\vartheta}}(x)=x-\\\\vartheta , we get the transformation\\nas expected. By applying equation 66 to the other groups G 2 , … , G 6 , G α G_{2},\\\\ldots,G_{6},G_{\\\\alpha} , we obtain the results presented in example 2.2 .\\nThus, we have a framework that, in principle, allows us to compute a symmetry group for any PDE system. For PDE systems with a certain additional property, we can give even a stronger statement. According to [ 31 , Def. 2.70] , a system of PDEs 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} is called local solvable at a point ( x 0 , u 0 ( d ) ) ∈ X × 𝒰 ( d ) (x_{0},u^{(d)}_{0})\\\\in X\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U}^{(d)} , if there is a smooth solution u = f \\u200b ( x ) u=f(x) for x x in a neighbourhood of x 0 x_{0} , with u 0 ( d ) = pr ( d ) \\u2061 f \\u200b ( x 0 ) u_{0}^{(d)}=\\\\operatorname{pr}^{(d)}f(x_{0}) . The whole PDE system 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} is called locally solvable, if this property holds for any point ( x 0 , u 0 ( d ) ) (x_{0},u^{(d)}_{0}) satisfying 𝒟 \\u200b ( x 0 , u 0 ( d ) ) = 0 \\\\mathcal{D}(x_{0},u^{(d)}_{0})=0 . For a locally solvable system, we can give a sufficient and necessary description of symmetry groups:\\nLet 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} be a locally solvable system of PDEs with maximal rank defined over M ⊆ X × U M\\\\subseteq X\\\\times U and let G G be a local group of transformations acting on M M . G G is a symmetry group of 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} , if and only if\\nholds for any infinitesimal generator 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} of G G .\\nThus, for locally solvable systems, we can derive all symmetry groups of the PDE system with the aforementioned framework. We would like to conclude this section by recapping all the steps to compute the symmetry group:\\nCheck maximal rank and local solvability of 𝒟 \\\\mathcal{D} .\\nWrite an ansatz for a vector field 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} on X × 𝒰 X\\\\times\\\\mathcal{U} according to equation 42 and compute its prolongation equations 43 , 44 and 45 .\\nDerive the infinitesimal criterion theorems A.1 and A.5 , i.e., the prolongation of 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} applied on the PDE should vanish whenever the PDE is satisfied.\\nBy comparing the coefficients of the infinitesimal criterion, one obtains an overdetermined system of simple PDEs (“determining equations”).\\nSolve the determining equations by elementary methods, to get the most general generators 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} and choose a basis of the subspace generated by 𝐯 \\\\mathbf{v} .\\nDerive 1-parameter Lie groups from infinitesimal generators by the exponential map g ϑ ∘ ( x , u ) = exp \\u2061 ( ϑ \\u200b 𝐯 ) ∘ ( x , u ) g_{\\\\vartheta}\\\\circ(x,u)=\\\\exp(\\\\vartheta\\\\mathbf{v})\\\\circ(x,u) .\\nDerive the transformation maps from these group actions by equation 66 .\\nThere are several implementations available, which will solve this task step by step.

       "  'abstract': 'We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations, the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model’s accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models, facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions, showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.'},\n",

Unlike plain text, these documents combine different modalities, including text, tables, and figures, embedded in human-friendly layouts that encode semantic relationships. Effectively understanding such documents requires not only extracting textual content but also reasoning over their visual and structural organization. This has given rise to the task of visually rich document understanding (VRDU) (Wang et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Ding et\\xa0al., 2022 ) which aims to develop systems to automatically analyze VRDs and answer user queries, underpining various practical applications (Liang et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Rombach & Fettke, 2024 ) .\\nDespite recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs) on single-page or short documents (Xie et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Lv et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Hu et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , real-world long documents spanning dozens or even hundreds of pages remain highly challenging.\\nFeeding entire documents into a model’s context is computationally expensive and introduces substantial noise, making it difficult for VLMs to focus on relevant pages (Cho et\\xa0al., 2024 ) .\\nA more scalable alternative is to have the VLM reason only over semantically relevant pages retrieved by a multimodal retriever (Faysse et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , following the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm (Cho et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Chen et\\xa0al., 2025a ) .\\nRecent work has extended this idea by building prompting-based pipeline in which VLMs passively perform predefined subtasks such as query reformulation, retrieved content summary or answer synthesis within fixed workflows (Han et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Wang et\\xa0al., 2025b ) .\\nWhile effective, these systems rely on static reasoning patterns and rigid workflows, limiting their ability to generalize or adapt strategies to diverse user queries.\\nThis motivates shifting the research focus to the Agentic VRDU (A-VRDU) task, which requires the model to act as an agent that can actively navigate and reason over long documents to deliver accurate and adaptive question answering beyond fixed RAG pipelines.\\nRecent studies (Chen et\\xa0al., 2025b ; Jin et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Song et\\xa0al., 2025 ) show that modeling search as an action and optimizing the workflow with outcome-based RL yields more generalizable agents that can actively gather information from external databases, offering a promising direction for the open problem of A-VRDU.\\nHowever, extending this framework to fine-tune VLMs for A-VRDU poses unique challenges.\\nUser queries often reference specific documents, page numbers, or require reasoning across consecutive pages, where generic semantic retrieval is inefficient.\\nMoreover, document-level information gathering typically demands multi-turn interaction with retrieval models, where sparse and delayed outcome-based rewards fail to reinforce helpful intermediate steps or discourage redundant actions.\\nA further challenge arises from the high-dimensional visual inputs.\\nWe empirically observe that fully masking the visual tokens when computing the policy gradient, as in existing approaches, leads to unstable training dynamics and can even cause collapse.\\nThese limitations motivate our framework, A ctive L ong- D ocum E nt N avigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn RL framework that trains VLMs as interactive agents for navigation in long, visually-rich documents.\\nThe overall reasoning-action rollout of ALDEN is illustrated in fig. 1 .\\nALDEN expands the action space by introducing the fetch action, which enables direct page-index access to complement search-based retrieval and efficiently handle diverse queries.\\nWe incorporate a cross-level reward function as opposed to the sparse outcome-based reward typically used, which integrates rule-based turn-level supervision with a token-level repetition penalty to provide fine-grained process supervision, encouraging informative evidence collection while discouraging repeated query formulations.\\nFinally, ALDEN incorporates a visual semantic anchoring mechanism, which constrains the hidden states of generated and visual tokens separately during training to preserve the grounding of visual-token representations and improve overall training robustness.\\nWe build a training corpus from DUDE (Van\\xa0Landeghem et\\xa0al., 2023 ) , MPDocVQA (Tito et\\xa0al., 2023b ) , and SlideVQA (Tanaka et\\xa0al., 2023b ) to train an A-VRDU agent with ALDEN and evaluate it on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines and demonstrates the effectiveness of its key components. Overall, the A-VRDU task establishes a new paradigm for processing practical, lengthy VRDs, shifting from passive document reading to autonomous navigation and reasoning. ALDEN’s strong results validate this paradigm and provide guidance for building efficient, robust A-VRDU agents from VLMs.\\nOverall, our main contribution can be summarized as follows:\\nWe propose the agentic visually-rich document understanding (A-VRDU) task that aims to develop agents that can actively navigate and reason over long visually-rich documents.\\nTo perform the A-VRDU task, we introduce ALDEN , a multi-turn RL framework with three key components: an expanded action space featuring a novel fetch action, a cross-level reward function, and a visual semantic anchoring mechanism, which together enable efficient and robust training.\\nWe construct a training corpus for training the A-VRDU agent and conduct extensive experiments on five commonly used VRDU benchmarks, showing that ALDEN significantly outperforms the strongest baseline, improving the answer accuracy by 9.14% on average.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'We propose A ctive L ong- D ocum E nt N avigation (ALDEN), a reinforcement learning framework for training VLMs as interactive agents that can actively navigate and reason over long, visually rich documents by operating in a multi-turn reasoning–action loop, incrementally collecting evidence pages until a question can be confidently answered.\\nTo this end, ALDEN introduces three key components. (i) Expanded action space: the agent is equipped with both a semantic search action for retrieving relevant pages and a novel fetch action for direct page access, enabling flexible exploitation of document structure ( section 4.1 ). (ii) Cross-level reward function: supervision is provided jointly at the turn level and the token level, guiding the agent toward effective evidence collection and accurate answer generation ( section 4.2 ). (iii) Visual semantic anchoring: to stabilize RL training, ALDEN constrains the hidden-state evolution of generated and visual tokens respectively, mitigating drift and preserving semantic grounding during optimization ( section 4.3 ).\\nThe overall RL training pipeline of ALDEN is illustrated in fig. 2 and algorithm 1 .\\nIn Agentic VRDU, agents must flexibly access information that may be referenced either semantically or structurally. Relying solely on semantic retrieval is often insufficient: while it works for open-ended queries, it cannot efficiently resolve explicit page references (e.g.,“see page 12”) or reasoning steps that span consecutive pages.\\nTo address this, ALDEN augments the standard search operation with a complementary fetch action, which enables direct page-index access and better exploits the inherent structure of documents.\\nThe action space thus consists of three options, each expressed in a structured format that combines free-form reasoning with explicit actions:\\nSearch — <think>...</think><search>...</search> Generates a reasoning trace within the <think> tags followed by a semantic query enclosed within the <search> tags. An external retrieval module returns a ranked list of pages relevant to the current query using semantic similarity. This action is effective for open-ended queries where relevant content is not explicitly referenced.\\nFetch — <think>...</think><fetch>...</fetch> Similar to search, but the agent specifies a page number within the <fetch> tag, enabling direct access to that page without semantic matching.\\nThis action is crucial for handling explicit references to page numbers or structured navigation across consecutive pages.\\nAnswer — <think>...</think><answer>...</answer> Outputs the reasoning trace followed by the final answer. This action terminates the rollout.\\nOnce the action is parsed, the document returns the corresponding page images enclosed within the <result> tag.

An external retrieval module returns a ranked list of pages relevant to the current query using semantic similarity.

We evaluate how different reward schemes affect ALDEN’s retrieval and reasoning (Table 5 ).\\n(i) Outcome-based Only assigns a single scalar reward for final answer correctness.\\n(ii) Turn-level + Outcome adds rule-based turn-level supervision, improving Acc from 0.483 to 0.509 and Rec from 0.483 to 0.497, showing that denser feedback aids evidence localization.\\n(iii) Full ALDEN further introduces token-level shaping, yielding a smaller but consistent gain (Acc 0.513, Rec 0.506) and increasing unique pages from 1.22 to 1.39, indicating reduced query repetition and broader exploration.\\nOverall, the cross-level reward design fosters richer query reformulation and more thorough evidence gathering, enhancing both navigation and answer quality.\\nEffect of Visual Semantic Anchoring. We evaluate the effect of Visual Semantic Anchoring (VSA) on training stability and representation drift, as shown in Figure 3 .\\nWith a larger batch size (512) than in the main experiments (128), the VSA-enabled model achieves steadily increasing answer rewards, while the non-VSA variant fluctuates and collapses (a). VSA also maintains higher policy entropy, supporting healthier exploration (b).\\nFor representation alignment,\\nKL divergence of visual tokens grows unchecked without VSA, indicating hidden-state drift, whereas VSA constrains these values while allowing moderate growth for action tokens (c,d).\\nOverall, VSA achieves stabilizing RL training and preventing drift in visual representations.',\n",

We evaluate how different reward schemes affect ALDEN’s retrieval and reasoning (Table 5 ).\\n(i) Outcome-based Only assigns a single scalar reward for final answer correctness.\\n(ii) Turn-level + Outcome adds rule-based turn-level supervision, improving Acc from 0.483 to 0.509 and Rec from 0.483 to 0.497, showing that denser feedback aids evidence localization.\\n(iii) Full ALDEN further introduces token-level shaping, yielding a smaller but consistent gain (Acc 0.513, Rec 0.506) and increasing unique pages from 1.22 to 1.39, indicating reduced query repetition and broader exploration.\\nOverall, the cross-level reward design fosters richer query reformulation and more thorough evidence gathering, enhancing both navigation and answer quality.\\nEffect of Visual Semantic Anchoring. We evaluate the effect of Visual Semantic Anchoring (VSA) on training stability and representation drift, as shown in Figure 3 .\\nWith a larger batch size (512) than in the main experiments (128), the VSA-enabled model achieves steadily increasing answer rewards, while the non-VSA variant fluctuates and collapses (a). VSA also maintains higher policy entropy, supporting healthier exploration (b).\\nFor representation alignment,\\nKL divergence of visual tokens grows unchecked without VSA, indicating hidden-state drift, whereas VSA constrains these values while allowing moderate growth for action tokens (c,d).\\nOverall, VSA achieves stabilizing RL training and preventing drift in visual representations.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'To evaluate the effectiveness of ALDEN, we compare it against three categories of methods:\\nBase VLMs supporting multi-image input. These models directly take the entire multi-page document as context without retrieval, leveraging their built-in multi-page visual processing capabilities. For fairness, we select open-source VLMs of similar scale to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, including LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B (Liu et\\xa0al., 2024a ) , Phi-3.5-Vision-Instruct (Abdin et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , LLaVA-One-Vision-7B (Li et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , SmolVLM-Instruct (Marafioti et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , mPLUG-DocOwl2 (Hu et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , LEOPARD (Jia et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , InternVL3.5-8B-Instruct (Wang et\\xa0al., 2025c ) .\\nVisual RAG methods. These methods use the user query to retrieve the most relevant document pages and feed them into the model as context. We include M3DocRAG (Cho et\\xa0al., 2024 ) as a strong baseline, as well as our proposed ALDEN. To isolate the impact of our reward function design, we additionally evaluate a variant that trains the same backbone with GRPO using only outcome-based rewards (no turn-level shaping), mirroring common text-only RLHF setups as in ReSearch (Chen et\\xa0al., 2025b ) . Specifically,\\nM3DocRAG is a multi-modal document understanding framework designed for multi-page and multi-document question answering. It first encodes each page into joint visual-text embeddings using a multi-modal encoder, then retrieves the top-K relevant pages via a MaxSim-based retrieval mechanism, optionally accelerated with FAISS for large-scale documents. Finally, a multi-modal language model processes the retrieved pages to generate precise answers, effectively handling complex queries that require reasoning over both textual and visual content.\\nReSearch introduces a framework that trains large language models to integrate reasoning and search in a unified process. The model learns, via reinforcement learning, when and how to perform search actions during multi-step reasoning, using search results to guide subsequent reasoning steps. By treating search as part of the reasoning chain, ReSearch enables LLMs to solve complex multi-hop tasks, demonstrate self-correction and reflection, and generalize effectively across benchmarks, achieving significant performance gains over baseline models.\\nHybrid RAG methods. These approaches combine visual and textual retrieval by first applying an OCR tool to extract all text from the document. The query is then used to retrieve both the most relevant page image and the most relevant OCR-extracted text, which are jointly fed into the model. We evaluate MDocAgent (Han et\\xa0al., 2025 ) and VidoRAG (Wang et\\xa0al., 2025b ) as a representative method in this category.\\nMDocAgent is a multi-modal, multi-agent framework for document understanding that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with specialized agents to handle complex documents. The system employs a General Agent for multi-modal context retrieval, a Critical Agent for identifying key information, a Text Agent for analyzing textual content, an Image Agent for interpreting visual elements, and a Summarizing Agent to synthesize results. By coordinating these agents, MDocAgent effectively integrates textual and visual reasoning, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and error reduction compared to existing large vision-language models and RAG-based methods. For all five agents in this framework, we consistently use the original LLaMA3.1-8B as the LLM for the text agent, while employing a consistent VLMs, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, for remaining agents.\\nViDoRAG is a multi-agent framework designed to enhance the understanding of visually rich documents. It employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid retrieval strategy to effectively handle multi-modal retrieval, integrating both textual and visual information. The framework incorporates a dynamic iterative reasoning process, utilizing agents such as Seeker, Inspector, and Answer to iteratively refine the understanding and generation of responses. This approach addresses challenges in traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods by improving retrieval accuracy and enabling complex reasoning over visual documents. We use Qwen2.5-VL-7B as backbone for all agents in this methods.',\n",

An efficient solution to a problem uses only necessary information and takes as few steps as possible.\\nTo characterize efficiency, we adopt a formalization of deductive reasoning based on logic programming (Kowalski, 1974 ) .\\nOur perspective is that logic programming provides a clean and flexible framework for reasoning within a well-understood proof system.\\nGiven a logic program—that is, a set of inference rules and axioms—a proof of some goal theorem can be viewed as a path in a hypergraph induced by the inference rules, starting from vertices corresponding to axioms and terminating at a vertex corresponding to the goal theorem.\\nThen, the most efficient proof is simply a shortest such path.\\nUsing this machinery, the goal of this paper is to evaluate a language model’s reasoning efficiency.\\nThus, we require an additional mechanism to bridge the gap between reasoning in logic programming and reasoning in natural language.\\nTo this end, we introduce the notion of a verbalized logic program, in which each theorem in the logic program is associated with a set of natural language strings.\\nVerbalized logic programs allow us to map the deductions performed by an LM—expressed as a natural language proof—onto deductions performed during the execution of a logic program.\\nWhile numerous recent papers use number of generated tokens as a proxy for efficiency (Arora & Zanette, 2025 ; Han et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Ma et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , doing so conflates inefficiency stemming from two separate sources: (1) unnecessary deduction steps and (2) verbosity in the natural language strings expressing those deduction steps.\\nIn contrast, our framework disentangles these two factors, with our paper’s experiments emphasizing the former.\\nEmpirically, we construct verbalized logic programs for grade school math word problems (GSM problems; Cobbe et\\xa0al., 2021 ; Li et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Zhang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , adopting methods from Opedal et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ) .\\nOur primary experimental manipulative is the injection of irrelevant axioms into these GSM programs,\\nwhich yields many possible implications that are irrelevant to a goal theorem of interest.\\nWe experiment on problems that vary both in how much the information in the irrelevant axioms overlap with the goal theorem, as well as in how many such axioms are injected,\\ngeneralizing existing datasets that only include a single irrelevant axiom (Shi et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Mirzadeh et\\xa0al., 2025 ) .\\nWe first measure accuracy, showing that current LMs are less accurate on problems containing irrelevant axioms than on equivalent problems without them.\\nThis performance gap often persists even in the simplest cases, where a single irrelevant axiom from the same domain is introduced, and grows larger as more irrelevant axioms are added.\\nWe confirm that this reduction in accuracy is not due to longer inputs alone: LMs usually perform better on control problems of equal length but without irrelevant content.\\nNext, we map the reasoning performed by the LM onto theorems they correspond to when executing the logic program.\\nWe find that while the LMs predict most of the correct intermediate theorems for the problems where they correctly generate the goal, they are often inefficient.\\nIn particular, for GSM problems where about half of the axioms are irrelevant, about half of the model’s predicted theorems are irrelevant too, i.e., not needed for proving the goal.\\nThe LMs are particularly inefficient when the irrelevant axioms overlap semantically with the query—for instance, when the question asks “how many cats does Ryan have?” and the irrelevant axioms also mention “Ryan” or “cats” .\\nOn the other hand, these results also suggest that the LMs’ search procedure sometimes employ a useful heuristic based on such overlap.\\nOur results shed some light on how LMs, albeit in natural language, perform inference.\\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: § ˜ 2 situates our contributions among related work. § ˜ 3 provides relevant background on logic programming and discusses how reasoning efficiency is measured relative to shortest proofs. § ˜ 4 introduces verbalized logic programs and the specifics of our GSM programs. § ˜ 5 presents experiments and results on how LMs reason on verbalized GSM programs with irrelevant axioms.

Thus, M M is the subset of the Herbrand base that is true given the axioms and inference rules in the program; we call elements of M M theorems .\\nDue to our inclusion of built-ins that encompass basic arithmetic operations, it is undecidable to compute M M (Dantsin et\\xa0al., 2001 ) , i.e.,\\nin general, we cannot decide whether h ∈ T 𝒫 ∗ \\u200b ( A ) h\\\\in\\\\mathrm{T}^{*}_{\\\\mathcal{P}}(A) for an arbitrary h ∈ H h\\\\in H .\\nGiven a logic program 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} , we are often interested in determining whether there exists a theorem in 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} that is an instantiation of a specific (possibly non-ground) atom.\\nWe refer to such atoms as queries . 6 6 6 In principle, queries may also be ground; however, only the non-ground case is of theoretical interest here, as it extends beyond what can be handled by the machinery introduced so far. For example, building on the running example drawn from Sterling & Shapiro ( 1994 , §5) , we may wish to ask whether there exists a theorem that instantiates the atom ancestor \\u200b ( X , ishmael ) {\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{ancestor}}({\\\\color[rgb]{0,.50,.18}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,.50,.18}\\\\textit{{X}}},{\\\\color[rgb]{0.0,0.0,0.5}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.5}\\\\textit{{ishmael}}}) .\\nAnswering such a query amounts to finding all substitutions for X that make the atom provable from 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} .\\nWhen X can take on infinitely many instantiations, more sophisticated inference mechanisms—most notably, unification (Robinson, 1965 ) —are required to perform this kind of non-ground reasoning effectively.\\nIn this paper, however, we restrict attention to queries in which each variable is known a priori to range over a fixed, finite domain, which allows us to avoid additional complexities.\\nA hypergraph 𝒢 \\\\mathcal{G} (B-hypergraph; Gallo et\\xa0al., 1993 ) is a tuple ( V , E ) (V,E) , where V V is a set of vertices, and E ⊆ 2 V × V E\\\\subseteq 2^{V}\\\\times V is a set of hyperedges , where a hyperedge e = T ↣ v h e=T\\\\rightarrowtail{v}_{h} consists of a t ail T ⊆ V T\\\\subseteq V , with | T | > 0 |T|>0 , and a h ead v h ∈ V {v}_{h}\\\\in V .\\nWe define the size of a hypergraph as | 𝒢 | = def | V | |\\\\mathcal{G}|\\\\mathrel{\\\\mathop{=}\\\\limits^{\\\\vbox to1.20552pt{\\\\kern-2.0pt\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptstyle\\\\text{\\\\tiny def}$}\\\\vss}}}|V| where 𝒢 = ( V , E ) \\\\mathcal{G}=(V,E) . 7 7 7 We note that this is non-standard; the size of a hypergraph is more often defined as its number of hyperedges or the sum of the cardinalities of its hyperedges (Gallo et\\xa0al., 1993 ) . We use this definition to sync with the experimental setup, which we explain in § 5 .\\nFuture work could easily adapt our efficiency metric to other definitions.

Thus, M M is the subset of the Herbrand base that is true given the axioms and inference rules in the program; we call elements of M M theorems .\\nDue to our inclusion of built-ins that encompass basic arithmetic operations, it is undecidable to compute M M (Dantsin et\\xa0al., 2001 ) , i.e.,\\nin general, we cannot decide whether h ∈ T 𝒫 ∗ \\u200b ( A ) h\\\\in\\\\mathrm{T}^{*}_{\\\\mathcal{P}}(A) for an arbitrary h ∈ H h\\\\in H .\\nGiven a logic program 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} , we are often interested in determining whether there exists a theorem in 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} that is an instantiation of a specific (possibly non-ground) atom.\\nWe refer to such atoms as queries . 6 6 6 In principle, queries may also be ground; however, only the non-ground case is of theoretical interest here, as it extends beyond what can be handled by the machinery introduced so far. For example, building on the running example drawn from Sterling & Shapiro ( 1994 , §5) , we may wish to ask whether there exists a theorem that instantiates the atom ancestor \\u200b ( X , ishmael ) {\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{ancestor}}({\\\\color[rgb]{0,.50,.18}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0,.50,.18}\\\\textit{{X}}},{\\\\color[rgb]{0.0,0.0,0.5}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.5}\\\\textit{{ishmael}}}) .\\nAnswering such a query amounts to finding all substitutions for X that make the atom provable from 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} .\\nWhen X can take on infinitely many instantiations, more sophisticated inference mechanisms—most notably, unification (Robinson, 1965 ) —are required to perform this kind of non-ground reasoning effectively.\\nIn this paper, however, we restrict attention to queries in which each variable is known a priori to range over a fixed, finite domain, which allows us to avoid additional complexities.',\n",

We generate strings using ancestral sampling, restricting the context length to 4000 4000 tokens.\\nOur experimental design is based on in-context learning (Brown et\\xa0al., 2020 ) .\\nSpecifically, we use five fixed in-context examples of shortest proofs to expose the LM to proofs in our verbalized logic programs.\\nThe verbalized proofs are ordered under a DFS traversal of the theorems in the proof, such that the axioms are popped in the same order they occur in the verbalized text.\\nSee § ˜ D.2 for the prompt.\\nWe begin by analyzing how irrelevant axioms influence an LM’s ability to generate the correct goal theorem for non-ground queries.\\nWe employ the two-step prompting strategy given by Kojima et\\xa0al. ( 2022 ) .\\nIn the first step, the model is prompted to produce a natural-language proof outlining its reasoning process.\\nThis natural-language process is then mapped to a proof in the verbalized logic program.\\nIn the second step, we prompted the LM a second time—conditioned on the proof it generated—to produce the goal theorem.\\nIn Table ˜ 2 , we report model accuracy in generating the correct goal theorem.\\nWe observe that even a single irrelevant axiom reduces model performance, particularly for Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5.\\nPerformance degrades further as additional irrelevant axioms are introduced.\\nThe performance of the most capable model, DeepSeek-R1, is nearly saturated at perfect accuracy, though slight decreases are still observed when irrelevant axioms are included.\\nAcross models, accuracy on problems containing irrelevant axioms is almost always lower than on the corresponding control examples, suggesting that irrelevance has a substantial effect on accuracy beyond what can be explained by longer problem statements.\\nThe only exception is Llama-3.1, whose performance on problems with one irrelevant axiom exceeds that of the corresponding control.\\nQwQ-32B stands out as an outlier: for this model, performance on the control problems is significantly higher than on the original base problems.\\nIn Fig. ˜ 7 ( § ˜ D.4 ), we present results stratified by agent and entity overlap ( § ˜ 4.3 ).\\nA consistent pattern emerges: such overlap between the goal and irrelevant axioms makes solving the problem more difficult.\\nCompared to no overlap, performance drops with both kinds of overlap, suggesting both serve as heuristics during search. While drops are typically larger for agent overlap than for entity overlap, we note that this could be partially due to the entities being topically related ( § ˜ 4.3 ).\\nIn the following subsection, we analyze the proofs in greater detail to further illuminate these effects.\\nIn Fig. ˜ 3 we plot the empirical distribution over the number of tokens in the model’s output and compare it to the number of tokens in the natural language annotation of the shortest proof, taking only the proofs that concluded at the correct goal theorem. This analysis, as well as those in the remainder of this section, are done on the problems with multiple irrelevant trees (i.e., the kind of structural overlap with the most axioms; § ˜ 4.3 ).\\nWe observe that all models often use more tokens than are in the annotations, suggesting that they use more compute than necessary to prove goal theorems. This is consistent with findings on reasoning models ( § ˜ 2 ), but holds also for the Llama model. However, these results do not confirm that the models generate irrelevant theorems—they might just be more verbose than our annotations.\\nThis leads us into our efficiency analysis in line with the technical exposition in § ˜ 3.2 .\\nThis analysis is performed for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct since only those models followed the required formatting ( § ˜ 4.2 ); 12 12 12 We manually verified parsing accuracy on the theorems generated by the models for a subset of 20 20 randomly sampled examples. An additional class representing that there is no match with any annotated theorem in the proof is included as well. The parser predicted the correct (or correctly predicted no) match in 394 / 397 = 99.2 % 394/397=99.2\\\\% of the theorems for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and 381 / 384 = 99.2 % 381/384=99.2\\\\% of the theorems for Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct. however, we perform a more crude analysis based on only the arithmetic expressions for the other two models in § ˜ D.4 .\\nWe report the efficiency metric presented in § ˜ 3.2 for the problems where the LM generated the correct goal theorem, comparing against the shortest proof generated with our method ( App. ˜ C ). 13 13 13 LMs often generated the same theorems multiple times. We chose to ignore such duplicates in the evaluation. We omit built-ins from the efficiency analysis since those are not verbalized.\\nAdditionally, we note that it might be the case that all irrelevant steps the models take are axioms; the LMs may simply be stating that some axioms are irrelevant to the query.\\nWe therefore also consider a metric in which only non-axiom theorems are counted.\\nIn § ˜ D.4 we provide an additional analysis on search order.\\nThe main results are shown in Table ˜ 3 (non-ground queries), with scores stratified by agent and entity overlap. The efficiency scores are far from 100 % 100\\\\% , meaning that the models predict several theorems beyond the required ones present in the shortest proof.\\nAdditionally, we observe that the efficiency scores vary significantly across the type of overlap ( p < 0.001 ) (p<0.001) , so we conclude that lexical information in the query has a substantial effect on proof planning.\\nWe finally comment on the results that only consider non-axioms, presented at the last row in Table ˜ 3 .\\nWe again observe efficiency scores that are considerably below 100 % 100\\\\% , showing that the LMs prove theorems that are irrelevant to the query. § ˜ D.3 gives an example where Llama-3.1-8B proves irrelevant theorems.\\nWe compare the performance to the same problems when presented with ground queries.\\nQueries tend to be non-ground in the GSM domain (Riley et\\xa0al., 1983 ; Cobbe et\\xa0al., 2021 ) .\\nSince LMs are heavily influenced by training data, we therefore expect them to perform better on non-ground queries.\\nOur results on the same verbalized logic programs as before, but with ground queries, are presented on the right-hand side of Table ˜ 3 . We observe lower efficiency scores, suggesting that LMs are indeed worse at proving ground theorems in this domain.',\n",

( 2022 ) .\\nIn the first step, the model is prompted to produce a natural-language proof outlining its reasoning process.\\nThis natural-language process is then mapped to a proof in the verbalized logic program.\\nIn the second step, we prompted the LM a second time—conditioned on the proof it generated—to produce the goal theorem.\\nIn Table ˜ 2 , we report model accuracy in generating the correct goal theorem.\\nWe observe that even a single irrelevant axiom reduces model performance, particularly for Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5.\\nPerformance degrades further as additional irrelevant axioms are introduced.\\nThe performance of the most capable model, DeepSeek-R1, is nearly saturated at perfect accuracy, though slight decreases are still observed when irrelevant axioms are included.\\nAcross models, accuracy on problems containing irrelevant axioms is almost always lower than on the corresponding control examples, suggesting that irrelevance has a substantial effect on accuracy beyond what can be explained by longer problem statements.\\nThe only exception is Llama-3.1, whose performance on problems with one irrelevant axiom exceeds that of the corresponding control.\\nQwQ-32B stands out as an outlier: for this model, performance on the control problems is significantly higher than on the original base problems.\\nIn Fig. ˜ 7 ( § ˜ D.4 ), we present results stratified by agent and entity overlap ( § ˜ 4.3 ).\\nA consistent pattern emerges: such overlap between the goal and irrelevant axioms makes solving the problem more difficult.\\nCompared to no overlap, performance drops with both kinds of overlap, suggesting both serve as heuristics during search. While drops are typically larger for agent overlap than for entity overlap, we note that this could be partially due to the entities being topically related ( § ˜ 4.3 ).\\nIn the following subsection, we analyze the proofs in greater detail to further illuminate these effects.',\n",

This analysis, as well as those in the remainder of this section, are done on the problems with multiple irrelevant trees (i.e., the kind of structural overlap with the most axioms; § ˜ 4.3 ).\\nWe observe that all models often use more tokens than are in the annotations, suggesting that they use more compute than necessary to prove goal theorems. This is consistent with findings on reasoning models ( § ˜ 2 ), but holds also for the Llama model. However, these results do not confirm that the models generate irrelevant theorems—they might just be more verbose than our annotations.\\nThis leads us into our efficiency analysis in line with the technical exposition in § ˜ 3.2 .\\nThis analysis is performed for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct since only those models followed the required formatting ( § ˜ 4.2 ); 12 12 12 We manually verified parsing accuracy on the theorems generated by the models for a subset of 20 20 randomly sampled examples.

This framework enables us to disentangle efficiency due to generating irrelevant theorems from efficiency due to verbose natural language verbalizations of those theorems.\\nWe applied this framework to empirically investigate how language models perform reasoning on math word problems that have many irrelevant axioms. We found that introducing irrelevant axioms into reasoning problems leads to significantly lower answer accuracies for most models—even when controlling for problem length—and proofs that exhibit frequent detours through irrelevant theorems.\\nOur work highlights the need to improve models in terms of reasoning efficiency, as well as the advantages to viewing deductive reasoning through the lens of logic programming.',\n",

We only sample atoms that are not in set .\\nWe comment on two more details of Alg. ˜ 2 . First, whenever we sample an elimination rule b 1 , . . . , b K − 1 , p ( t 1 , . . . , t N ) ⊢ h b_{1},.\\\\mkern-1.0mu.\\\\mkern-1.0mu.,b_{K-1},{\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{p}}(t_{1},.\\\\mkern-1.0mu.\\\\mkern-1.0mu.,t_{N})\\\\vdash h , we require the last premise, p ( t 1 , . . . , t N ) {\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{p}}(t_{1},.\\\\mkern-1.0mu.\\\\mkern-1.0mu.,t_{N}) , to be an axiom, i.e., we do not recursively apply the algorithm on this premise. This is due to the fact that the rules in 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} are in harmony, and so the addition of introduction rules preceding elimination rules could result in locally-reducible regions in the output proof, and so the proof would not be shortest.\\nSecond, if we sample a union rule, we always require the C C -terms of the premises to be singleton sets.\\nOtherwise, a shorter proof could have been obtained by several instantiations of the union rule. 14 14 14 This is analogous to folding and unfolding (Tamaki & Sato, 1984 ) .\\nThroughout the algorithm, we sample substitutions from Θ g \\u200b ( 𝒫 ) \\\\Theta_{\\\\textsc{g}}(\\\\mathcal{P}) .\\nBy substituting under the constraints laid out by the arithmetic built-ins we ensure numerical consistency.\\nHowever, numerical substitutions may fail due to unsatisfiable constraints, i.e., Θ ′ \\\\Theta^{\\\\prime} in Alg. ˜ 2 may become empty before we sample from it. We therefore perform rejection sampling until a successful substitution has been found. In a few cases, this may run prohibitively long. We therefore retry a maximum of 1000 1000 times before rejecting the candidate proof and sampling a new one.\\nWe apply Alg. ˜ 2 described in the previous subsection to generate irrelevant axioms. As mentioned in § ˜ 4.3 , we augment a logic program 𝒫 W = ℛ W ⊔ A W \\\\mathcal{P}_{\\\\text{W}}=\\\\mathcal{R}_{\\\\text{W}}\\\\sqcup A_{\\\\text{W}} —as sampled by the method described above—with M M additional sets of irrelevant axioms A ~ 1 ⊔ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ⊔ A ~ M \\\\mathchoice{\\\\hbox{$\\\\displaystyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\textstyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptstyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptscriptstyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}_{1}\\\\sqcup\\\\cdot\\\\mkern-1.0mu\\\\cdot\\\\mkern-1.0mu\\\\cdot\\\\sqcup\\\\mathchoice{\\\\hbox{$\\\\displaystyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\textstyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptstyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptscriptstyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}_{M} . In simple terms, we do so by applying the sampling procedure again, once for every A ~ m \\\\mathchoice{\\\\hbox{$\\\\displaystyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\textstyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptstyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptscriptstyle\\\\widetilde{A}$}}_{m} , with additional restrictions to not generate duplicate axioms. As we will show later, this procedure for generating irrelevant axioms requires the additional constraint that the inference rules ℛ \\\\mathcal{R} in the logic program 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} be E E -monotonic. With each application of the sampling procedure, we provide a perturbed goal argument h g h_{g} . At least one C C -term or E E -term of the original goal will be replaced with a new value (e.g., in 𝒫 W \\\\mathcal{P}_{\\\\text{W}} , either the agent, the entity, or both will be perturbed). Precisely which term is perturbed depends on the experimental setting (see § ˜ 4.3 ). The set of forbidden theorems A × A_{\\\\times} is initialized to be the theorems in the shortest proof (including the axioms) from 𝒫 W = ℛ W ⊔ A W \\\\mathcal{P}_{\\\\text{W}}=\\\\mathcal{R}_{\\\\text{W}}\\\\sqcup A_{\\\\text{W}} , thus, avoiding generating those theorems. The same is done incrementally for the irrelevant axioms as they are generated, guaranteeing disjoint sets.\\nMoreover, for practical reasons, the distribution from which we sample is slightly modified. In particular, we restrict cont {\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{cont}} predicates to have singleton agent sets; otherwise, the number of irrelevant axioms could get very large.\\nFurthermore, we exclude the rate {\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{rate}} predicate, as we found that overlapping agents and entities could sometimes be hard to instantiate with a rate {\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{rate}} atom, since it requires a particular semantic relationship between the two entity terms in the atom, e.g., “apples” per “basket” .\\nEnforcing these restrictions led to substantially more efficient rejection sampling during the substitution part of Alg. ˜ 2 .\\nWhen ordering the axioms in natural language, it is undesirable to have a predictable ordering of relevant and irrelevant axioms, e.g., appending all irrelevant axioms to follow the relevant ones.\\nWe therefore randomly reorder them in a manner that respects the ordering of the values of the timestamp.\\nHere, we will show that the above procedure for generating proofs produces a shortest proof—a proof from axioms A A to a goal h g h_{g} for which there does not exist a shorter proof of h g h_{g} from A A . Furthermore, we will show that each generated proof is unique : There are no other shortest proofs with the same axioms and goal theorem.\\nC C -conservation, monotonicity, and harmony of the inference rules alone is insufficient to guarantee that the proofs generated by the procedure described in App. ˜ C are shortest.

This is due to the fact that the rules in 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} are in harmony, and so the addition of introduction rules preceding elimination rules could result in locally-reducible regions in the output proof, and so the proof would not be shortest.\\nSecond, if we sample a union rule, we always require the C C -terms of the premises to be singleton sets.\\nOtherwise, a shorter proof could have been obtained by several instantiations of the union rule. 14 14 14 This is analogous to folding and unfolding (Tamaki & Sato, 1984 ) .\\nThroughout the algorithm, we sample substitutions from Θ g \\u200b ( 𝒫 ) \\\\Theta_{\\\\textsc{g}}(\\\\mathcal{P}) .\\nBy substituting under the constraints laid out by the arithmetic built-ins we ensure numerical consistency.\\nHowever, numerical substitutions may fail due to unsatisfiable constraints, i.e., Θ ′ \\\\Theta^{\\\\prime} in Alg. ˜ 2 may become empty before we sample from it. We therefore perform rejection sampling until a successful substitution has been found. In a few cases, this may run prohibitively long. We therefore retry a maximum of 1000 1000 times before rejecting the candidate proof and sampling a new one.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'We apply Alg. ˜ 2 described in the previous subsection to generate irrelevant axioms.

As we will show later, this procedure for generating irrelevant axioms requires the additional constraint that the inference rules ℛ \\\\mathcal{R} in the logic program 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} be E E -monotonic. With each application of the sampling procedure, we provide a perturbed goal argument h g h_{g} . At least one C C -term or E E -term of the original goal will be replaced with a new value (e.g., in 𝒫 W \\\\mathcal{P}_{\\\\text{W}} , either the agent, the entity, or both will be perturbed). Precisely which term is perturbed depends on the experimental setting (see § ˜ 4.3 ). The set of forbidden theorems A × A_{\\\\times} is initialized to be the theorems in the shortest proof (including the axioms) from 𝒫 W = ℛ W ⊔ A W \\\\mathcal{P}_{\\\\text{W}}=\\\\mathcal{R}_{\\\\text{W}}\\\\sqcup A_{\\\\text{W}} , thus, avoiding generating those theorems. The same is done incrementally for the irrelevant axioms as they are generated, guaranteeing disjoint sets.\\nMoreover, for practical reasons, the distribution from which we sample is slightly modified. In particular, we restrict cont {\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{cont}} predicates to have singleton agent sets; otherwise, the number of irrelevant axioms could get very large.\\nFurthermore, we exclude the rate {\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{rate}} predicate, as we found that overlapping agents and entities could sometimes be hard to instantiate with a rate {\\\\color[rgb]{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\definecolor[named]{pgfstrokecolor}{rgb}{0.640625,0.02734375,0.453125}\\\\mathrm{rate}} atom, since it requires a particular semantic relationship between the two entity terms in the atom, e.g., “apples” per “basket” .\\nEnforcing these restrictions led to substantially more efficient rejection sampling during the substitution part of Alg. ˜ 2 .\\nWhen ordering the axioms in natural language, it is undesirable to have a predictable ordering of relevant and irrelevant axioms, e.g., appending all irrelevant axioms to follow the relevant ones.\\nWe therefore randomly reorder them in a manner that respects the ordering of the values of the timestamp.',\n",

Consider the following problem, with the irrelevant axioms marked in bold :\\nAnatola has 67 keys. Ichabod has 23 packets. Clayborne has 55 crayons. Pieter has 20 parrots. Ichabod has 30 packets less than Winnah. Pieter then gives Yorgos 6 parrots. Clayborne has 96 crayons less than Imogene. Anatola has 55 keys less than Rahel. Dennie has 19 parrots.

Edgar has 3 parrots more than Eddie. How many parrots does Eddie have in all?\\nNote that the only axioms that are relevant are the ones containing information about parrots.\\nThe shortest proof for this problem requires the application of four inference rules and can be written in natural language as follows:\\nPieter has 20 parrots.\\nPieter then gives Yorgos 6 parrots.\\nSo Pieter has 20 - 6 = 14 parrots.\\nDennie has 19 parrots.\\nDianna owns 4 parrots.\\nSo the difference between the number of parrots Dennie and Dianna have is 19 - 4 = 15.\\nThe number of parrots that Edgar has more than Pieter is the same as the difference between the number of parrots that Dennie has compared to Dianna.\\nSo Edgar has 14 + 15 = 29 parrots.\\nEdgar has 3 parrots more than Eddie.\\nSo Eddie has 29 - 3 = 26 parrots.\\nIn this case, employing a best-first search heuristic based on lexical overlap with the query (i.e., prioritizing theorems that contain information about parrots) will yield the above shortest proof. Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct did not opt for that strategy. Instead, it generated the following, inefficient solution to this problem:\\nAnatola has 67 keys.\\nAnatola has 55 keys less than Rahel.\\nSo Rahel has 67 + 55 = 122 keys.\\nIchabod has 30 packets less than Winnah.\\nSo Winnah has 23 + 30 = 53 packets.\\nClayborne has 96 crayons less than Imogene.\\nSo Imogene has 55 + 96 = 151 crayons.\\nPieter has 20 parrots.\\nPieter then gives Yorgos 6 parrots.\\nSo Pieter has 20 - 6 = 14 parrots.\\nThe number of parrots that Edgar has more than Pieter is the same as the difference between the number of parrots that Dennie has compared to Dianna.\\nDennie has 19 parrots and Dianna has 4 parrots.\\nThe difference between Dennie and Dianna is 19 - 4 = 15.\\nSo Edgar has 15 more parrots than Pieter.\\nEdgar has 15 + 14 = 29 parrots.\\nEdgar has 3 parrots more than Eddie.\\nSo Eddie has 29 - 3 = 26 parrots.\\nTherefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 26.\\nFig. ˜ 7 shows further stratified results that were mentioned in § ˜ 5.1 . We briefly note that these results suggest that the models might make use of a heuristic based on such overlap. (Recall that the problem sets are otherwise identical.) One could reasonably expect that a model could learn such a heuristic, based on previous work suggesting that models may derive the conclusion to a proof step greedily within a forward pass before initiating the step in the output tokens (Kudo et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Wu et\\xa0al., 2024 ) .\\nSince QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1 did not generate output corresponding to strings in our verbalized program, we performed a separate, more crude analysis for those two models.\\nRather than matching the full generated token sequence, we match only the arithmetic expressions. They are matched with the ground-truth expressions from the built-ins of the corresponding inference rules. This can only be done for theorems that are not axioms, since only those require an arithmetic built-in (i.e, arithmetic expression) to prove.\\nArithmetic expressions are extracted flexibly, accounting for formatting irregularities and natural language that may be interleaved. The parser may also predict no match for a particular model output if no matches are found.\\nWe manually verified parsing accuracy (macro-average) on model outputs over 20 randomly selected example problems. The parser predicted the correct match (or correctly predicted no match) in 94.4% of cases for QwQ-32B and 94.8% of cases for DeepSeek-R1.\\nTable ˜ 4 displays the results. We observe results that are overall consistent with the main conclusions of the paper; even state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1—despite performing well in terms of accuracy ( Table ˜ 2 )—appear to generate theorems that are irrelevant to the goal theorem. As with the two models discussed in the main text, the efficiency scores decrease when there is agent and/or entity overlap between the irrelevant axioms and the goal theorem.\\nWhile our results in § ˜ 5.2 suggest that LMs make use of information in the query to prove goals, they also reveal that LMs generate irrelevant theorems. Thus, LMs appear to use some heuristic, albeit an imperfect one, in their reasoning.\\nHere, we present a limited analysis on whether this heuristic could be in combination with either DFS or BFS. We do so by examining the order in which intermediate theorems, both relevant and irrelevant, are generated by the LM, and comparing this order to the respective reference orders.\\nFurthermore, we compare the LM’s ordering to the theorems in the shortest proof as visited in DFS order as a control.\\nBefore presenting the results, we make note of a few limitations of this analysis.\\nFirst, the only irrelevant theorems we consider in the DFS and BFS orderings are those that are generated by Alg. ˜ 2 when sampling the axioms for the irrelevant goal theorems h ~ 1 . . . h ~ M \\\\mathchoice{\\\\hbox{$\\\\displaystyle\\\\widetilde{h}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\textstyle\\\\widetilde{h}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptstyle\\\\widetilde{h}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptscriptstyle\\\\widetilde{h}$}}_{1}.\\\\mkern-1.0mu.\\\\mkern-1.0mu.\\\\mathchoice{\\\\hbox{$\\\\displaystyle\\\\widetilde{h}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\textstyle\\\\widetilde{h}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptstyle\\\\widetilde{h}$}}{\\\\hbox{$\\\\scriptscriptstyle\\\\widetilde{h}$}}_{M} ( § ˜ 4.3 ).\\nIn addition, we note that the in-context examples were ordered according to DFS; see § ˜ 5 . However, the examples were chosen so that the ordering of theorems that are not axioms would be the same under both DFS and BFS. We therefore ignore the axioms as we compare the orderings.\\nConcretely, the DFS and BFS orderings correspond to the order in which atoms are popped from the chart 𝒞 \\\\mathcal{C} in Alg. ˜ 1 , where: (i) 𝒞 \\\\mathcal{C} is implemented as a stack for DFS and a queue for BFS, (ii) the axioms are popped from the agenda Q Q in the order in which they are presented (i.e., pushed) to the model in natural language (as described in § ˜ 5 ), and (iii) we do not include pops of axioms.\\nAs our metric, we compute the Levenshtein distance between the sequence of indices produced by the LM and the ground truth reference ordering under the different search orders, normalized by the longest of the two sequences.\\nThe results are shown in Fig. ˜ 8 . We observe that the models’ search orders are closer to DFS than to BFS across all types of query overlap. Furthermore, for Llama-3.1, they are closer to the DFS-based ordering required for the shortest proof than DFS when there is no agent or entity overlap between the goal and the irrelevant axioms. Qwen2.5-Math appears to be less efficient however, consistent with the results in Table ˜ 3 . These findings suggest that LMs tend to follow a depth-first exploration of the proof space in combination with the superficial heuristic. However, future work should perform a more rigorous analysis to confirm these preliminary findings.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities, yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language—as generated by an LM—with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions—even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions—and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.111Code for this project is available at https://github.com/rycolab/reasoning-efficiency.'},\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming non-player character (NPC) interactions in games, enabling natural language-driven experiences that transcend traditional script constraints (Wang et\\xa0al. 2024 ; Maleki and Zhao 2024 ; Relu Games 2025 ; Krafton 2025 ) . A critical yet underexplored application for these dynamic NPCs is in-game trading, a core mechanic connecting economic activities and character development (Kim et\\xa0al. 2024 ) . While LLMs promise to replace static menus with emergent gameplay, enabling context-aware recommendations and relationship-based negotiations (Figure 1 ), their deployment faces a fundamental challenge.\\nThe core tension lies in reconciling LLMs’ creative flexibility with the semi-structured procedures of commercial transactions. In-game trading must follow a flow of browse, offer, review, and confirm, serving as an essential safeguard to protect player assets. Yet, the unconstrained, intent-driven nature of LLMs makes them prone to circumventing this structured flow (Agrawal et\\xa0al. 2024 ; Shukuri et\\xa0al. 2023 ; Wu et\\xa0al. 2024 ) . For instance, their tendency to directly satisfy a perceived user goal can lead a simple price inquiry to trigger an unwanted purchase, or a negotiation skipping the critical review step. Such procedural violations erode player trust and undermine system integrity.\\nThis challenge extends beyond gaming to any rule-governed human-AI interaction requiring both conversational naturalness and procedural compliance, such as in customer service protocols or medical consultations. Despite its importance, existing approaches either sacrifice flexibility for structure (Shukuri et\\xa0al. 2023 ) or fail to enforce critical procedural constraints, leaving a significant gap in deploying LLMs for real-world applications where both qualities are essential.\\nTo address this, we introduce Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP), a prompting methodology that resolves the tension between flexibility and control by making state-tracking an explicit, autoregressive process. Instead of relying on general reasoning heuristics (e.g., “think step-by-step”), ASTP requires the LLM to infer and output the previous dialogue state’s label before predicting the next. This verifiable process is embedded in a structured Prime–Guide–Enforce workflow that maintains procedural compliance without compromising conversational naturalness. Additionally, we demonstrate that this state-aware architecture enables a practical post-processing mechanism that boosts numerical reliability, allowing smaller models to match the accuracy of larger ones with substantial speed gains.\\nOur main contributions are as follows:\\nWe propose a prompting strategy, Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) , that makes dialogue state transitions explicit and verifiable.\\nWe design a structured prompt workflow, Prime–Guide–Enforce , that significantly improves procedural compliance, increasing adherence to key safeguards from 78.1% to 99.6%.\\nWe develop a placeholder-based post-processing method, PPP , that improves price calculation accuracy in trading tasks from 84.3% to 99.3%, enabling smaller models to match the accuracy of larger ones.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'One of the well-established fields for managing goal-oriented dialogue interactions is Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). TOD aims to help a user complete a specific task, e.g., booking a flight. A traditional TOD system relies on core components like a dialogue state tracker, which fills predefined ‘slots’ (e.g., destination, time) from user utterances (Feng et\\xa0al. 2023 ; Hudeček and Dušek 2023 ; Li et\\xa0al. 2024 ) , and a dialogue policy, which decides the next system action (e.g., calling API or requesting additional information) based on the current state (Schick et\\xa0al. 2023 ; Cao et\\xa0al. 2024 ) .\\nThe paradigm has shifted towards end-to-end systems that replace this modular pipeline (Hosseini-Asl et\\xa0al. 2020 ; Saley et\\xa0al. 2024 ) . AutoTOD (Xu et\\xa0al. 2024 ) , specifically, re-architects the workflow using a single unified prompt that decomposes a complex goal into a series of ‘sub-tasks’. The system then selects the most appropriate sub-task for a user’s intent in each turn and executes the prompt for each sub-task, guiding the LLM to implicitly handle state-tracking and policy decisions. This highlights a fundamental characteristic of the TOD paradigm: its dialogue policy is optimized to achieve a goal, not to enforce a specific sequence of interactions. This goal-driven optimization, while effective for flexible task handling, is fundamentally misaligned with the demand for strict procedural adherence, as it makes the system prone to bypassing critical safeguards like a final review.\\nAnother approach to governing LLM interactions involves explicitly defining the conversational path. Recognizing that open-ended generation is often insufficient for goal-oriented tasks, this line of research focuses on providing a blueprint to guide the LLM (Agrawal et\\xa0al. 2024 ; Du et\\xa0al. 2025 ) . However, while these methods excel at the design of the flow, the challenge of developing a robust runtime mechanism to compel the LLM to adhere to it remains underexplored.\\nDistinct from defining a conversational path, other methods model the workflow based on the task-solving state,\\nenhancing control and efficiency (Wu et\\xa0al. 2024 ; Rozanov and Rei 2024 ) .\\nPrompting techniques that enhance an LLM’s reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have proven remarkably effective at unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large models (Wei et\\xa0al. 2022 ; Kojima et\\xa0al. 2022 ; Wang et\\xa0al. 2022 ; Bai et\\xa0al. 2022 ; Yao et\\xa0al. 2023 ; Madaan et\\xa0al. 2023 ) . These methods typically prompt the LLM to “think step-by-step” before responding, which can improve performance on a wide range of tasks. However, their reasoning process is often unconstrained and generic. In contrast, for applications requiring procedural adherence, explicitly specifying what the LLM should think about offers a more robust approach. Our approach transforms vague ’thinking’ into a ’verifiable procedure’ by instructing the model to first identify the previous state and then compelling it to report that state in its response. This targeted approach provides a more robust anchor for the model’s reasoning, making it more suitable for procedural tasks than generic instructions.\\nMeanwhile, research in our direct application domain, game NPCs, has focused on a different trajectory. Generative Agents (Park et\\xa0al. 2023 ) aim to create believable\\nNPCs through sophisticated memory mechanisms, while recent work on persistence (Song 2025 ) and narrative generation (Peng et\\xa0al. 2024 ) pushes creative boundaries.\\nYet these systems deliberately avoid structured constraints, prioritizing emergent behavior (Lan et\\xa0al. 2024 ) over reliability. Even MART (Kim et\\xa0al. 2024 ) , which specifically targets merchant NPCs, reveals this fundamental gap. Specifically, it handles price negotiation but cannot manage multi-item transactions or enforce the purchase confirmations essential for protecting player assets.\\nIn summary, the landscape of related work reveals a clear and critical gap. Task-oriented systems prioritize goal completion over procedural flow, design-focused frameworks lack enforcement mechanisms, general reasoning techniques are not tailored for strict procedural control, and research in game NPCs has favored creativity over compliance. This highlights the need for a new approach specifically designed to ensure robust, verifiable procedural adherence within conversational agents. Our work aims to fill this gap.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'This section details a method for building a reliable merchant NPC by addressing both conversational coherence and transactional integrity. The method first introduces Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) to enforce a logical dialogue flow, and then integrates a state-specific post-processing rule as a vital component to guarantee computational accuracy within that flow.\\nIn the game, players can naturally converse and trade with merchant NPCs. The prompt for the merchant NPC is structured to provide rich contextual information for the LLM. While the prompt contains several components, the core of the proposed method lies in the design of the Dialogue Guidelines within a unified prompt. The full prompt consists of the following.\\nSystem Instructions : Defines the NPC’s persona, role, and behavioral directives. It also includes situational context like the in-game location and time to ground its response in the game world.\\nGame World Data : Contains two distinct sets of item data: a list of all items existing in the game world, and a separate list of the NPC’s actual sellable inventory. This dual structure allows the NPC to act as both an immersive world informant and a reliable merchant.\\nDialogue History : Presents preceding conversation turns, including the player’s latest utterance and the context inferred by the NPC from previous interactions.\\nDialogue Guidelines : Provides the core logic for dialogue state management. These rules instruct the LLM on how to infer the current dialogue state and when to transition between states, which will be detailed in the following sections.\\nExpected Response Format : Instructs the LLM to generate its output as a single, well-formed JSON object. This approach relies on the LLM’s capability to follow formatting instructions within the prompt, rather than utilizing specialized structured output functionalities. Key fields in the JSON object include NPC’s spoken dialogue, the inferred dialogue state, and data pertinent to the current transaction, which contains information such as an array of items with their quantities and prices.\\nWe define the system’s dialogue state space 𝒮 \\\\mathcal{S} as follows:\\nBase state set ( S base S_{\\\\text{base}} ): Main dialogue states unrelated to trading.\\nTrade state set ( S trade S_{\\\\text{trade}} ): Specific states possible within a trading context.\\nComplete state space ( 𝒮 \\\\mathcal{S} ): The union of both sets.\\nThe dialogue history h t h_{t} up to turn t t is defined as a sequence of user utterances ( u u ) and system responses ( r r ):\\nWe define a state extraction function to retrieve the previous state from the last response:\\nThe core functionality of Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) is modeled as:\\nGiven ( h t , u t + 1 , 𝒢 ) (h_{t},u_{t+1},\\\\mathcal{G}) ,\\nthe Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting function\\ncomputes ( s t , s t + 1 , r t + 1 ) (s_{t},s_{t+1},r_{t+1}) through the following sequential process:\\nState Inference: Infers the previous dialogue state from the conversation history\\nState Transition: Determines the current state based on the inferred previous state and user input\\nResponse Generation: Generates an appropriate NPC response for the determined state\\nwhere, ℋ , 𝒰 , 𝒢 , ℛ \\\\mathcal{H},\\\\mathcal{U},\\\\mathcal{G},\\\\mathcal{R} denote the spaces of dialogue histories, user utterances, game contexts included in the prompt, and system responses, respectively.\\nThe key insight is that s t s_{t} is not directly extracted but inferred by the LLM from the dialogue history, enabling state-aware decision making.\\nWhile the ASTP function autonomously infers states, it must satisfy certain transition constraints for system stability and rule compliance. Let ℰ ⊆ 𝒮 × 𝒮 \\\\mathcal{E}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal{S}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{S} denote the set of valid state transitions permitted by the system.\\nAny valid execution of f ASTP f_{\\\\text{ASTP}} must satisfy:\\nTransition Validity: ( s t , s t + 1 ) ∈ ℰ (s_{t},s_{t+1})\\\\in\\\\mathcal{E}\\nCritical Transaction Constraint:\\nInference Consistency:\\nRelying on implicit context can lead to critical procedural ambiguities. For instance, after an NPC offers a price (the OFFER_SELL state), a user’s agreement like “Great, let’s do it!” is ambiguous: should the system proceed to the mandatory review step ( FINAL_CHECK ) or directly execute the sale ( COMMIT_SALE )? ASTP resolves this by treating the previous state, s t s_{t} , as an explicit intermediate variable that must be identified before determining the next state, s t + 1 s_{t+1} . This factorization of the state determination process makes it a more transparent and structured task.\\nTranslating the formal ASTP model into a reliable prompt-based implementation is a non-trivial challenge. Experiments reveal that performance is highly sensitive not only to inclusion of specific rules but critically to their structural arrangement within the prompt.\\nTherefore, the design strategically creates a distinct cognitive workflow for the LLM: it first primes the model by demanding upfront identification of the previous state (Element 3), then guides its reasoning with conditional rules (Elements 1 and 2), and finally enforces compliance by requiring the previous state identification to be reported in the response (Element 4). This architectural choice transforms state-tracking from a mere suggestion into an explicit, verifiable task, proving essential for achieving robust procedural adherence.\\nThe framework implements this workflow through four key design elements incorporated into the Dialogue Guidelines (Figure 2 ):\\nElement 1: Basic State Definitions define what each dialogue state represents and the NPC’s appropriate behaviors within it. This element provides the foundational knowledge for the “Guiding” phase of the workflow.\\nElement 2: State Transition Conditions specifies the prerequisite conditions for entering each state. These conditions are intentionally coupled with their corresponding state definitions in the prompt, a structural arrangement that reduces cognitive load and makes the “Guiding” phase more effective than referencing a separate set of rules.\\nElement 3: Directive to Identify Previous State instructs the model to explicitly identify the previous dialogue state before any other reasoning. This directive serves as the critical “Priming” stage of the workflow.\\nElement 4: Directive to Respond including Previous State requires the model to report its identified previous state within its required JSON response. This final step acts as the “Enforcing” stage, making the entire state-tracking process transparent and verifiable.\\nIt is a well-documented challenge that LLMs, being optimized for language, can struggle with precise mathematical computations.\\nEven when correctly listing item quantities and individual prices, errors may occur in final price calculations, compromising transaction integrity.\\nThis issue is critical not just for evaluating the LLM’s arithmetic skills, but for ensuring a trustworthy player experience, as the total price spoken by the NPC must be perfectly consistent with the underlying transaction data.\\nSolution : The solution implements accurate price calculations through a placeholder-based, post-processing system. The key to this approach lies in its state-specific application, as it is activated only during OFFER_SELL states. This state is defined as the critical point where the NPC proposes the official, system-calculated price for a transaction before any creative negotiation begins. This targeted enforcement guarantees calculation accuracy when it is most critical, while preserving the LLM’s conversational flexibility in other states. The system works as follows:\\nPlaceholder usage : The prompt includes the rule “use __PRICE__ for the final price amount” (Figure 2 )\\nAccurate calculation : The system calculates the correct price based on responded item information and replaces the placeholder\\nError prevention : The accurately calculated price is included in dialogue history, ensuring correct price references in subsequent conversations\\nResponse example :\\nOriginal LLM response :\\nNPC dialogue after post-processing : “Two iron swords and a mana potion are 150 gold.”\\nAdvantages : This approach achieves 99.3% accurate price calculation without additional computational overhead, eliminating the need for complex schemas or\\nTool use mechanisms. The single response processing maintains system efficiency while ensuring mathematical precision. This state-based prompting approach demonstrates how external system functionalities such as accurate calculation and post-processing can be integrated into LLM-driven interactions, providing a foundation for broader applications in rule-governed interactive systems.',\n",

This factorization of the state determination process makes it a more transparent and structured task.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'Translating the formal ASTP model into a reliable prompt-based implementation is a non-trivial challenge. Experiments reveal that performance is highly sensitive not only to inclusion of specific rules but critically to their structural arrangement within the prompt.\\nTherefore, the design strategically creates a distinct cognitive workflow for the LLM: it first primes the model by demanding upfront identification of the previous state (Element 3), then guides its reasoning with conditional rules (Elements 1 and 2), and finally enforces compliance by requiring the previous state identification to be reported in the response (Element 4). This architectural choice transforms state-tracking from a mere suggestion into an explicit, verifiable task, proving essential for achieving robust procedural adherence.\\nThe framework implements this workflow through four key design elements incorporated into the Dialogue Guidelines (Figure 2 ):\\nElement 1: Basic State Definitions define what each dialogue state represents and the NPC’s appropriate behaviors within it. This element provides the foundational knowledge for the “Guiding” phase of the workflow.\\nElement 2: State Transition Conditions specifies the prerequisite conditions for entering each state. These conditions are intentionally coupled with their corresponding state definitions in the prompt, a structural arrangement that reduces cognitive load and makes the “Guiding” phase more effective than referencing a separate set of rules.\\nElement 3: Directive to Identify Previous State instructs the model to explicitly identify the previous dialogue state before any other reasoning. This directive serves as the critical “Priming” stage of the workflow.\\nElement 4: Directive to Respond including Previous State requires the model to report its identified previous state within its required JSON response. This final step acts as the “Enforcing” stage, making the entire state-tracking process transparent and verifiable.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'It is a well-documented challenge that LLMs, being optimized for language, can struggle with precise mathematical computations.\\nEven when correctly listing item quantities and individual prices, errors may occur in final price calculations, compromising transaction integrity.\\nThis issue is critical not just for evaluating the LLM’s arithmetic skills, but for ensuring a trustworthy player experience, as the total price spoken by the NPC must be perfectly consistent with the underlying transaction data.\\nSolution : The solution implements accurate price calculations through a placeholder-based, post-processing system. The key to this approach lies in its state-specific application, as it is activated only during OFFER_SELL states. This state is defined as the critical point where the NPC proposes the official, system-calculated price for a transaction before any creative negotiation begins. This targeted enforcement guarantees calculation accuracy when it is most critical, while preserving the LLM’s conversational flexibility in other states. The system works as follows:\\nPlaceholder usage : The prompt includes the rule “use __PRICE__ for the final price amount” (Figure 2 )\\nAccurate calculation : The system calculates the correct price based on responded item information and replaces the placeholder\\nError prevention : The accurately calculated price is included in dialogue history, ensuring correct price references in subsequent conversations\\nResponse example :\\nOriginal LLM response :\\nNPC dialogue after post-processing : “Two iron swords and a mana potion are 150 gold.”\\nAdvantages : This approach achieves 99.3% accurate price calculation without additional computational overhead, eliminating the need for complex schemas or\\nTool use mechanisms.

For each dialogue, the run was initiated with a fixed seed (0-299) that fixed the player’s initial utterance.\\nThe virtual player’s objective was to naturally converse and purchase items, though it was not required to complete a purchase in every interaction. This objective was guided by behavioral guidelines that included asking for item information, negotiating prices, and changing the selected items mid-trade.\\nThe conversations followed two scenarios: (1) Specific Item Purchase , where the player requested up to six items randomly drawn from 20 sellable and 32 unsellable items\\n, with purchase quantities for each item randomly selected from 1 to 5; and (2) Item Recommendation , where the player requested items for a specific purpose (e.g., “for a goblin battle”).\\nOn average, conversation in Scenario 2 were approximately 9% longer than in Scenario 1 across all experimental settings, reflecting the more exploratory nature.\\nAll experiments were run on a machine with Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU, 16GB of RAM, and integrated Intel Arc Graphics. LLM inferences were performed via the Google Gemini API. 1 1 1 All API calls were made in July 2025. Unless otherwise noted, the default configuration used gemini-2.5-flash model with a temperature of 0.7 and a thinking budget of 0. The full prompts for all experimental setups are provided in the Appendix.\\nExperimental Design :\\nASTP’s compliance with dialogue flow was evaluated through an ablation study of its four key elements and a comparison against methods adapted from other studies. The four elements are: (1) state definitions, (2) state transition conditions, (3) directive to identify the previous state, and (4) directive to output the previous state. As detailed in Table 1 , the ASTP baselines were constructed by cumulatively adding these elements, which allowed isolation of their impact.\\nFor AutoTOD (Xu et\\xa0al. 2024 ) , one of the comparison methods, the exact content of Baseline1 was converted into the prompt structure from the official AutoTOD implementation 2 2 2 https://github.com/DaDaMrX/AutoTOD . This approach was chosen because both prompts fundamentally rely on state definitions, making for a direct comparison of prompt structures. In the adapted version, each trade state was framed as a ‘sub-task’, and all external API-calling functions were removed as the experiment relies on in-context data.\\nFor the DFI-Inspired method, an explicit state-transition graph was added to the Baseline1 prompt. This technique was inspired by a concept for applying an dialogue flow to constrain an LLM, which was illustrated as a potential application in Dialog Flow Induction (DFI) (Agrawal et\\xa0al. 2024 ) . For the Zero-shot-Chain-of-Thought (ZS-COT) (Kojima et\\xa0al. 2022 ) comparison, the Baseline2 prompt was augmented by adding the one-line instruction: “Before generating a response, first think step by step to determine the correct context and action. Your thought process should be recorded in the npc_thoughts field.” This method was tested as an alternative to using Element 3 and 4, representing a different approach to enhancing the model’s reasoning. Figure 3 provides a visual comparison of these distinct prompt architectures. Finally, AutoTOD+ and DFI-Inspired+ were created by augmenting each respective base prompt with all four ASTP elements.\\nEvaluation Metric :\\nThe primary evaluation metric is the State Transition Compliance Rate (STCR), defined as the proportion of transactions that correctly pass through FINAL_CHECK before finalizing in COMMIT_SALE . 3 3 3 To ensure a fair comparison, STCR was calculated on a normalized sample of dialogues that reached the COMMIT_SALE state (N=218 for Scenario1, N=274 for Scenario2), the minimum number observed across all methods. As an irreversible step, this transition is fundamentally different from the flow’s other, more flexible transitions. These flexible transitions, such as re-entering negotiation from the final review stage, are designed for conversational fluidity, where the LLM’s inference is primarily driven by user intent.\\nThe transition into COMMIT_SALE , however, is intentionally rigid. Here, the LLM’s task transcends intent recognition: it must prioritize a procedural precondition (the previous state) over the user’s immediate utterance. This deliberate core tension makes it the ultimate test of a model’s ability to adhere to critical safeguards designed to prevent unintended transactions.\\nKey Results :\\nAs shown in Table 1 , the full ASTP method achieved near-perfect compliance. The ablation study reveals that while adding explicit transition rules (Element 2) significantly improved performance, the key to robust control lies in the interaction between Elements 3 and 4. Instructing the model only to identify the previous state (Element 3) yielded no benefit, likely by introducing ambiguity without an enforcement mechanism. However, compelling the model to output its inference (Element 4) proved highly effective. The highest compliance rate was achieved when both elements were combined, suggesting that the ‘identify’ directive provides a clear signal for the ‘output’ directive’s powerful enforcement mechanism.\\nA comparison with other methods offers further insights into the importance of prompt structure.\\nThe ZS-CoT method, while improving upon Baseline2, achieved a lower STCR than the full ASTP. This is conjectured to be because a generic “think-by-step” instruction, while encouraging an internal reasoning process, lacks the explicit enforcement mechanism of ASTP: the mandatory output of the inferred state. Lacking this constraint, ZS-CoT is more susceptible to deviating from procedural rules when faced with strong user intent. In particular, the performance gap between ZS-CoT and ASTP widens in Scenario 2, which involves more exploratory, recommendation-based conversations. The increased ambiguity and conversational complexity in this scenario place a higher cognitive load on the model. ASTP’s rigid mechanism forcing the LLM to re-anchor its context by identifying and outputting the previous state proves to be more robust in these complex situations.\\nBaseline1 yielded a higher STCR than AutoTOD despite both using only state definitions. This is conjectured to stem from their differing prompting paradigm. AutoTOD’s fragmented sub-task structure frames the task as a classification problem each turn, making it prone to skipping steps when faced with a strong user intent (e.g., a “Yes” to purchase). In contrast, Baseline1’s prompt presents state definitions as a unified list. This contextual proximity appears to implicitly suggest a sequential flow, guiding the model more effectively.\\nThe just-in-time instruction in Baseline2-which couples a transition rule directly with its state definition-also proved more effective than DFI-Inspired’s approach of referencing a separate state-transition graph. The latter likely increases the model’s congnitive load, leading to a slightly lower compliance rate.\\nMost notably, augmenting these other methods with all four ASTP elements (AutoTOD+, DFI-Inspired+) improved their performance. This demonstrates that ASTP’s core principles are not tied to a specific prompt format but are portable principles that can enhance an LLM’s ability to adhere to strict procedural rules. The state transition patterns in Figure 3 confirm that ASTP also induces natural, context-appropriate dialogue flows.\\nLLMs struggle with precise arithmetic operations, making simple calculation errors like “2×50 + 30 = 120 gold.” This poses significant problems for price calculations in trading, potentially undermining player trust and transaction integrity.\\nExperimental Design :\\nUtilizing dialogues from Scenario 1,\\nthis experiment compares performance across two key dimensions:\\n(Table 2 ):\\nASTP variants : ASTP, ASTP -PPP (an ablated version without Placeholder Post-Processing), ASTP -PPP +SO (the ablated version combined with Structured Output)\\nModel variants : gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.0-flash (lighter version), gemini-2.5-pro (high-performance)\\nEvaluation Metric : The evaluation focuses on price accuracy, along with token usage and response time.\\nPrice accuracy is the percentage of NPC responses where the total price stated by the LLM matches the sum calculated from the item details (i.e., prices and quantities) also provided within the same LLM response.\\nKey Results :\\nASTP showed consistent improvements in accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency across multiple evaluation dimensions.\\nFirst, in terms of accuracy, ASTP reached 100.0% in the OFFER˙SELL state, compared to 81.4% with ASTP -PPP . This improvement also extended to subsequent states, where ASTP achieved 99.3% accuracy versus 84.3% for ASTP -PPP . These results suggest that accurate initial pricing may help reduce downstream errors in multi-turn dialogues.\\nSecond, these accuracy gains were achieved without notable increases in computational cost. Token usage (441.6 vs 437.7) and response time (2.4 seconds) remained comparable to ASTP -PPP . By contrast, the ASTP -PPP +SO variant uses fewer completion tokens, but its price accuracy is much lower at 87.8% and 88.0%. For reliable transactions, ASTP’s accuracy is more crucial than this gain in token efficiency.\\nFurthermore, a high variability in thought token usage was observed in some configurations (e.g., 22.9 for ASTP -PPP +SO and 325.0 for the gemini-2.5-pro model). This likely reflects that the model’s internal reasoning demands fluctuate significantly depending on the dialogue context of each turn.\\nThird, ASTP also showed promising results with smaller models. When tested with gemini-2.0-flash, it achieved 100.0% accuracy in OFFER_SELL and 90.4% in other states, outperforming the ASTP -PPP , which achieved 48.7% and 59.0%, respectively.\\nThis demonstrates the robustness of the method on smaller models.\\nLastly, ASTP using gemini-2.5-flash reached comparable accuracy to ASTP -PPP with gemini-2.5-pro while requiring significantly fewer resources: 0 vs 1575.2 thought tokens (as the thinking budget for gemini-2.5-pro cannot be disabled via its API) and 2.4 vs 21.2 seconds in response time. These findings suggest that incorporating state-specific post-processing may allow smaller models to approximate the accuracy of larger ones, with considerably lower computational demands.\\nBeyond model performance, the choice of the placeholder keyword was observed to affect the robustness of the post-processing step.\\nThe concise keyword __PRICE__ consistently produced accurate and parsable outputs. In contrast, more complex variants such as __PRICE_PLACEHOLDER__ occasionally resulted in malformed completions like __PRICE_PLACEHOLDER_ or __PRICE_PLACEHOLDE__ . These inconsistencies highlight the importance of using short, unambiguous keywords to minimize generation errors.',\n",

Table 6 compares a dialogue from ASTP with one from AutoTOD, initiated with the same player’s utterance. The dialogue shows ASTP proceeding through the mandatory FINAL_CHECK step, while AutoTOD skips it.\\nFinally, Table 7 contrasts ASTP with its ablated version, ASTP -PPP . This illustrates the effectiveness of the Placeholder Post-Processing (PPP) mechanism. In the ASTP dialogue, the price is accurately established by post-processing in the OFFER_SELL state, and this accuracy is robustly maintained through subsequent turns, even with cart modifications.

To achieve this, we utilize Process Mining (PM) [ 9 ] , a set of techniques designed to analyze process execution logs,\\nenabling us to evaluate reasoning quality at the process-level rather than solely from final outcomes.\\nIn this short paper, we propose a novel reasoning-aware GRPO framework using PM, named PM4GRPO ,\\nwhich integrates PM techniques into the reward design of GRPO. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\\nWe introduce PM4GRPO , a novel GRPO framework featuring a reward model that incorporates the reasoning process itself into post-training.\\nFor each query, the policy model derive its own reasoning trace, which is then transformed into a process model.\\nThe framework quantitatively measures how well this process model conforms to the Teacher Model’s reasoning (i.e., conformance checking) and integrates this measure into the reward signal.\\nPM4GRPO does not enforce the policy model to replicate the Teacher Model’s reasoning strictly.\\nInstead, it encourages reasoning alignment while preserving the model’s freedom of thought, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning.\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we describe the proposed PM4GRPO framework in detail.\\nSection 3 presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.\\nFinally, we conclude the paper in Section 4 with a summary and future research directions.',\n",

A primary challenge in this domain lies in programming two arms to act in harmony to accomplish a complex goal.\\nSuch coordination demands a flexible control strategy that combines parallel, serial, and collaborative execution of skills.\\nMany previous approaches model manipulation as a sequential decision-making process, where a policy selects a single action or skill at each step [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] .\\nThis formulation, however, creates an inherent bottleneck for bimanual tasks, as it fails to capture opportunities for simultaneous execution and can lead to inefficient, underutilized behaviors.\\nIn this paper, we argue that the high-level decision problem is better framed as an integrated planning and scheduling problem, where the goal is to assign tasks to both arms, where at some points in time the arms act independently and at other points they act collaboratively.\\nTo this end, we propose a hierarchical framework built upon a library of reinforcement-learned primitive skills.\\nOur Transformer-based high-level policy functions as a skill scheduler, generating plans that specify the discrete skills and their continuous parameters for both arms.\\nWe highlight three contributions of this work:\\nWe propose a novel approach for bimanual manipulation that learns a library of arm-specific primitive skills using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and then through integrated skill planning & scheduling combines these in serial and parallel over time.\\nWe show how a Transformer-based scheduling policy can be trained to generate bimanual schedules that specify both discrete skills and their continuous parameters.\\nWe demonstrate through experiments that our approach achieves significantly higher success rates and efficiency compared to end-to-end and sequential planning baselines.',\n",

Can our bimanual skill scheduling policy effectively generate valid schedules that sequence both discrete skills and their continuous parameters for two arms simultaneously? Q3. Does our planing & scheduling formulation lead to more efficient and coordinated bimanual behaviors?\\nWe evaluate our framework on a long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation task with goal that: “ the objects are in the bin ”. This task involves placing one or two bulky objects into a bin, where the objects are too large for a single arm to grasp, lift, or reorient alone, which necessitates non-prehensile manipulation.\\nFurthermore, an object’s initial position may be out of reach for one arm. Consequently, this task demands a dynamic combination of strategies: from synchronized coordination for collaborative lifting to independent, asynchronous execution for repositioning. The variability in initial object layouts requires the policy to plan and schedule different skill sequences for each scenario. We build this environment and conduct all simulation experiments in IsaacLab [ 31 , 32 ] . To compare different approaches, we use three metrics: task success rate (SR) and task completion progress (CP), which is defined as the percentage of optimally-ordered task stages completed, and episode duration (ED) to measure completion efficiency.\\nBaselines. We compare our proposed framework against several representative baselines and ablations. We consider the following baselines:\\n1) RL-scratch is vanilla PPO [ 33 ] algorithm which learns the entire task from scratch.\\n2) Hierarchical RL (HRL) [ 26 ] is a hierarchical approach where a high-level policy selects the pre-trained low-level skills using RL.\\n3) Sequential-only planning [ 15 ] is a baseline that can only select one skill at each decision step, thus enforcing sequential, non-parallel execution.\\n4) Ours (Single Arm Ablation) is an ablation of our method constrained to use only a single arm.\\nFor all hierarchical methods, we use the same library of pre-trained low-level skills.\\nResults and analysis. Table 1 provides comprehensive results for all methods on two task variations: 1) rearranging one object and 2) rearranging two objects into a bin. It answers Q1 and Q2 by showing that our method outperforms the RL-scratch baseline, achieving a 45% higher Success Rate (SR) and 41% higher Task Completion Progress (CP).\\nAdditionally, we visualize the bimanual skill schedule during evaluation in Fig. 2 , showing that our bimanual skill scheduling policy not only selects the correct single-arm or bimanual skills in different situations, but also efficiently sequences skills for both arms to complete the task. We answer Q3 by comparing our method with Sequential Planning, which results in a 16% reduction in Episode Duration (ED) and highlights our method’s ability to more efficiently plan and schedule for both arms simultaneously.\\nPolicy rollout videos are available\\nat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DI_yTml3J4 .',\n",

Consequently, this task demands a dynamic combination of strategies: from synchronized coordination for collaborative lifting to independent, asynchronous execution for repositioning. The variability in initial object layouts requires the policy to plan and schedule different skill sequences for each scenario. We build this environment and conduct all simulation experiments in IsaacLab [ 31 , 32 ] . To compare different approaches, we use three metrics: task success rate (SR) and task completion progress (CP), which is defined as the percentage of optimally-ordered task stages completed, and episode duration (ED) to measure completion efficiency.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied by a surge in their computational and memory demands [ 43 ] , making quantization an indispensable technique for efficient deployment. A central challenge in quantizing LLMs, particularly those based on the Transformer architecture, is the presence of significant outliers [ 38 , 12 ] in activation distributions. These outliers, characterized by their large magnitude but infrequent occurrence, pose a considerable problem for low-precision representations. To accommodate this wide dynamic range, the AI hardware industry [ 31 ] is increasingly pivoting towards low-precision floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8 and FP4. Prominent examples like NVIDIA’s Blackwell architecture [ 31 ] underscore this trend, favoring the superior dynamic range of FP to handle outliers more gracefully than traditional integer (INT) formats.\\nHowever, this industry-wide momentum towards FP formats is based on an incomplete picture. The comparative advantages of FP and INT have not been systematically evaluated across different quantization granularities in a unified framework. Most studies [ 41 , 6 , 22 ] focus on a single format or compare them only at coarse granularities (e.g., per-channel), failing to answer a critical question: how does the performance trade-off between INT and FP evolve as granularity becomes finer? Since fine-grained (block-wise) quantization is now a standard technique [ 34 , 32 ] for mitigating outliers, understanding its interaction with the underlying number format is essential for effective algorithm-hardware co-design.\\nIn this paper, we conduct a comprehensive, systematic comparison of fine-grained INT and FP quantization. Our investigation reveals a critical \"crossover point\" in performance. While FP formats hold a distinct advantage in coarse-grained scenarios, we find that INT formats become highly competitive as the block size shrinks, though the benefit depends heavily on the bit width. As granularity becomes finer, the local dynamic range within each block is reduced, allowing the uniform precision of INT formats to become more effective. This trend is analyzed across modern block-wise formats, such as the 32-element blocks in Microscaling (MX) formats or the 16-element blocks in NVIDIA’s (NV) formats. To enable a direct comparison, we introduce and evaluate integer variants (e.g., MXINT8, MXINT6, MXINT4, NVINT4) alongside their standard FP counterparts (e.g., MXFP8, MXFP6, MXFP4, NVFP4).\\nOur key contributions are as follows:\\nWe develop a theoretical and statistical framework that models the quantization signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR) for both INT and FP formats. This framework enables a direct theoretical comparison of their performance trade-offs and clarifies the crossover points and .\\nWe demonstrate that MXINT8 consistently outperforms MXFP8 in both direct-cast inference and low-bit training. We also show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when combined with Hadamard rotation. Critically, we introduce a symmetric clipping method that resolves a gradient bias, enabling nearly lossless MXINT8 low-bit training.\\nWe present a comparative hardware cost analysis, demonstrating that fine-grained INT formats are significantly more area and energy-efficient than their floating-point counterparts at matched throughput.\\nCollectively, our findings challenge the prevailing FP-centric trajectory in AI hardware design and advocate for prioritizing fine-grained INT formats to achieve a more optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency in future AI accelerators.',\n",

Section 5.1 analyzes the crest factor and QSNR for six types of intermediate tensors in Figure 1 , offering a tensor-level perspective. Section 5.2 evaluates direct-cast inference, quantizing only the forward process. Section 5.3 presents results for low-bit training, quantizing both forward and backward processes.\\nSetup. To measure the QSNR in real data, we feed 8 WikiText2 [ 25 ] sequences of length 4096 into Llama-3.1-8B, run both forward and backward propagation in BFloat16 precision, and capture the six intermediate tensors (weights, activations, and gradients) indicated by ①–⑥ in Figure 1 . Llama-3.1-8B contains 224 linear layers across all transformer blocks. We collect these tensors for all 224 linear layers, leads totally 224 × 6 = 10752 224\\\\times 6=10752 tensors, and use them to compute the crest factors under different block size and QSNR under different low-bits formats. Specifically, QSNR is directly calculated tensor-wise, and crest factor is calculated block-wise and than average across the tensor. Additonally, we also apply random hadamard rotation [ 2 ] with dimension as 32 × 32 32\\\\times 32 to measure the effectiveness of such outlier surpression technical to crest factor and QSNR.\\nCrest factor results. Table 2 reports crest factor statistics in boxplot form. We focus on the 75% quantile ( i.e. , Q3) , which reflects typical worst-case behavior across 75% of cases.\\nFor channel-wise quantization (block size − 1 -1 ), Q3 is 11.97 11.97 , which is far above the crossover point in Figure 3 . This indicates that FP outperforms INT in most cases with coarse granularity.\\nFor the MX-format with block size 32 32 , Q3 is 2.96 2.96 . This value is well below the MXINT8 v.s. MXFP8 crossover point ( 7.55 7.55 ), so MXINT8 outperforms MXFP8 in most cases. In contrast, 2.96 2.96 is above the MXINT6 v.s. MXFP6 and MXINT4 v.s. MXFP4 crossover points ( 1.96 1.96 and 2.04 2.04 ), so MXINT6 and MXINT4 underperform their FP counterparts. After Hadamard rotation, Q3 decreases from 2.96 2.96 to 2.39 2.39 , which remains below 7.55 7.55 but above 1.96 1.96 and 2.04 2.04 ; thus, MXINT8 still wins, while MXINT6 and MXINT4 still lag behind MXFP6 and MXFP4.\\nFor the NV-format with block size 16 16 , Q3 is 2.39 2.39 , which equals the NVINT4 v.s. NVFP4 crossover point and then decreases to 2.11 2.11 after Hadamard rotation, favoring NVINT4 over NVFP4 post-rotation.\\nCrest factor v.s. QSNR results. Figure 4 reports measured QSNR across crest factors. The empirical trends closely follow the theoretical comparisons in Sec. 4 (Theorems 1–2) and the aforementioned crest factor reults:\\nMXINT8 v.s. MXFP8 : The QSNR of MXFP8 is nearly constant at 31.50 31.50 because of its large dynamic range and mantissa-bit bound. MXINT8 has an average QSNR of 40.35 40.35 , and thus significantly outperforms MXFP8.\\nMXINT6 v.s. MXFP6 and MXINT4 v.s. MXFP4 : MXINT6 and MXINT4 consistently lag behind MXFP6 and MXFP4, with or without random Hadamard rotation.\\nNVINT4 v.s. NVFP4 : Although the win rate of NVINT4 is 64.3 % 64.3\\\\% , its average QSNR is 20.55 20.55 , which is slightly below NVFP4’s 20.60 20.60 because NVINT4’s QSNR decreases faster than NVFP4’s as the crest factor increases. After random Hadamard rotation, NVINT4’s average QSNR rises to 21.65 21.65 , surpassing NVFP4’s 20.35 20.35 . Note that NVFP4’s QSNR decreases from 20.60 20.60 to 20.35 20.35 after rotation, which is consistent with Figure 3 : rotation reduces the crest factor, and when the crest factor is below 4 4 , NVFP4’s QSNR increases with the crest factor, so a reduction in crest factor lowers its QSNR.\\nOverall, real-data measurements corroborate the theory in Sec. 4 .\\nPrecisions. For inference, we compare the formats in Table 1 : MXFP8, MXINT8, MXFP6, MXINT6, MXFP4, MXINT4, NVFP4, and NVINT4. We perform direct-cast inference from a pretrained BFloat16 model and quantize all forward GEMMs.\\nModels.

We set h h to the block size (32 for MX formats and 16 for NV formats). We provide official open-source links in Sec. 11 .\\nMetrics. Our goal is to compare integer and floating-point low-bit formats under the same settings, so ranking is more informative than absolute accuracy. Following [ 14 ] , accuracy alone is not sufficient for compressed models because it can hide large behavioral changes. We therefore use distance metrics: specifically, we compute the KL divergence on WikiText2 [ 25 ] between each quantized model and its BFloat16 counterpart. To reduce noise, we compute the divergence over the softmax distribution restricted to the top-25 logits of the BFloat16 model.\\nResults. Table 3 summarizes the comparison between FP and INT formats. Without rotation, MXINT8 outperforms MXFP8 on all 12 models, while MXINT6, MXINT4, and NVINT4 perform worse than MXFP6, MXFP4, and NVFP4. Although NVINT4 and NVFP4 have similar average QSNR in Figure 4(a) , NVINT4 loses more often because higher crest factors create more worst-case behavior for integers. With random Hadamard rotation, MXINT8 and NVINT4 win on all 12 models; MXINT6 wins 1 of 12 and MXINT4 loses all 12, consistent with the tensor-wise analysis in Sec. 5.1 .\\nPrecisions. For training, we focus on nearly lossless low-bit training, which is more practical. Therefore, we study only the 8-bit setting and compare MXINT8 and MXFP8, since FP8 training is demonstrated to be nearly lossless in prior work [ 27 , 21 ] .\\nModels and datasets.

Detailed model architectures and training hyperparameters are in Sec. 11 .\\nMetrics. We measure training performance using two metrics: training loss and task accuracy. We smooth the training loss with an exponential moving average (coefficient 0.9 0.9 ). We compute all accuracies with lm_eval [ 17 ] through 5-shot evaluation. We report acc for WinoGrande [ 35 ] and acc_norm for HellaSwag [ 44 ] , Arc_Challenge, Arc_Easy [ 10 ] , PIQA [ 4 ] , and Openbookqa [ 26 ] .\\nResults. Figure 5 shows the loss curves for BF16, MXFP8, and MXINT8 training. The curves for MXFP8 and MXINT8 almost overlap with BF16. In addition, MXINT8 consistently outperforms MXFP8 with a loss that is lower by approximately 0.001 0.001 , as shown in the enlarged view in Figure 5 . Table 4 shows that MXINT8 also achieves nearly the same average accuracy across six common-sense reasoning tasks compared to BF16 training. These results demonstrate that MXINT8 supports nearly lossless low-bit training, while existing works [ 21 , 27 ] mainly focus on FP8 training.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Scope and assumptions. We develop a compact gate-level model to estimate the chip area and energy of a GEMM engine under low-precision formats. Specifically, a low-bit GEMM engine uses four components: a quantizer, a multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) unit, a dequantizer, and an FP32 accumulator. The proposed model accounts only for the MAC unit, a shared FP32 accumulator and a dequantizer; the quantizer is excluded from all cost accounting. In MX/NV formats, the VPU implements quantization by shift/divide-and-round, and the accumulation pipeline can fuse dequantization as two 8-bit integer additions for UE8M0 scale or two floating-point multiplications for E4M3 scale. We omit the quantizer block in VPU to isolate the cost driven by multiplication and accumulation. Unless otherwise stated, we take cell factors from a TSMC FinFET standard-cell library. We model only combinational logic; we ignore sequential elements, placement and routing, and interconnect to enable technology-aware, relative comparisons.\\nDesign choice: FP32 accumulation and MMU integration. A high-throughput Matrix-Multiply Unit (MMU), as in TPU-like designs [ 28 ] , integrates the multiply-and-accumulate datapath and downstream accumulation to improve performance and energy efficiency. To prevent error growth and preserve scalability, we accumulate in FP32. Under the same nominal bit width, FP multipliers are typically more area- and energy-efficient than INT multipliers, whereas FP adders are more expensive than INT adders due to exponent comparison/subtraction, mantissa alignment, and normalization [ 45 ] . With a uniform-alignment design [ 40 ] , the normalizer count reduces to one shared instance across the k k MAC lanes, and we divide its cost by k k .\\nMantissa aligner width. The mantissa aligner couples accuracy and cost: its bit width n n affects numerical fidelity and hardware complexity. We set\\nwhere x x and y y denote exponent and mantissa widths, respectively (for INT formats, x = 0 x\\\\!=\\\\!0 ). In all evaluations we use k = 32 k\\\\!=\\\\!32 for MX formats and k = 16 k\\\\!=\\\\!16 for NV formats, and psum_bit_width = 24 \\\\texttt{psum\\\\_bit\\\\_width}\\\\!=\\\\!24 .\\nMAC unit structure and sub-blocks. We model the MAC unit as a k k -lane array. Each lane comprises one multiplier. The adders from all lanes are fused together to form a multi-input adder tree structure, incorporating FP-specific alignment and normalization logic. Table 6 reports the dominant logic count (up to constant factors) for the main sub-blocks, where “Main Cells” indicate the standard-cell types used for area/energy aggregation. For FP multiplication, we multiply only mantissas and include an exponent adder. For FP addition, we model exponent comparator/subtractor, a barrel aligner, a wide mantissa adder, and one shared normalizer. For INT, we set x = 0 x\\\\!=\\\\!0 in the expressions.\\nArea and energy aggregation for MAC. Let 𝒮 \\\\mathcal{S} ={Multiplier, Adder(mantissa/int), Exponent adder, Exponent subtractor, Comparator, Aligner(barrel), Normalizer(shared)} be the set of sub-block types,\\nand 𝒢 = { FA , HA , XOR , AND , OR , MUX } \\\\mathcal{G}=\\\\{\\\\text{FA},\\\\text{HA},\\\\text{XOR},\\\\text{AND},\\\\text{OR},\\\\text{MUX}\\\\} be the set of cell types with technology-dependent area and energy factors A g A_{g} and E g E_{g} obtained from the standard-cell library.

The total MMU cost is\\nand, when we report per-lane figures, we divide the cost of shared blocks (the dequantizer and the FP32 accumulator) by k k .\\nSummary. The hardware model includes the MAC unit, the dequantizer, and the FP32 accumulator; the quantizer is excluded from the overhead calculation. Given a low-precision format with exponent/mantissa widths ( x , y ) (x,y) (with x = 0 x{=}0 for INT), a MAC array size k k , an aligner cap psum_bit_width (setting n n via Eq ( 44 ), and technology cell factors { A g , E g } g ∈ 𝒢 \\\\{A_{g},E_{g}\\\\}_{g\\\\in\\\\mathcal{G}} (plus the dequantizer and FP32-accumulator gate counts), the model predicts the area and energy of the MAC and accumulation stages. It captures the relative cost trends across MX/NV-INT/FP formats at the same nominal bit width, the sensitivity to the aligner width n n (critical for FP addition), and the effect of sharing both the normalizer, the dequantizer, and the FP32 accumulator across k k lanes.',\n",

Despite this industry trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI accelerators.'},\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Autonomous driving has gained broad attention from the public during the last few years [ 1 , 2 ] . With intelligence, the autonomous vehicle can have a more comprehensive perception of the surrounding traffic environment and make more reasonable driving decisions compared to human drivers. As a result, it is expected to bring society a large number of benefits, including improved mobility and a significant reduction in collisions. However, these benefits come with increased energy consumption of the computation platform, ranging from several hundred watts (W) to over 1 kW of power [ 3 ] . For example, the computing platform using the Nvidia AGX Orin SoC [ 4 ] has a Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 800W. These power demands can also increase the thermal demands on a vehicle’s climate-control system. When combined, these demands can significantly reduce vehicle range [ 5 ] .\\nThis factor especially limits the mobility of electric vehicles due to their limited battery range and long recharge time. Further, it leads to higher vehicle usage costs and aggravates global energy and environmental issues.\\nIn general, the computational consumption for autonomous driving includes perception computing, decision-making computing, navigation, storage, etc [ 3 ] . Among them, perception computing is the most power-intensive component since it requires large neural networks to extract vehicle features (e.g., position and orientation) in the traffic environment. The mainstream perception architectures can be categorized into camera-only methods [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] and multi-modality methods [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] , where camera-only methods rely solely on image data from cameras, while multi-modality methods fusion the image and point cloud data from both cameras and LiDAR [ 12 ] . Compared to camera-only methods, multi-modality methods have higher accuracy but incur significantly higher computational consumption. To alleviate this, researchers design model compression techniques to reduce the model size of multi-modality methods, including sparsification [ 11 ] , quantization [ 13 ] , and distillation [ 14 ] . However, they either maintain large computational consumption or exhibit significantly lower accuracy compared to the original multi-modality model in complex traffic scenarios, which may raise safety concerns of autonomous driving. Recently, a gate-based model [ 5 ] is proposed to automatically discard or add parts of the network by gating techniques, thus altering the computational consumption and accuracy. Nonetheless, it struggles to balance computational consumption and accuracy, and training such a model is not trivial.\\nIn summary, all the aforementioned methods reduce computational consumption by training a perception model with a reduced size. In this study, we aim to build a comprehensive and scalable perception optimization framework from the perspective of data management and tuning.\\n(1) Firstly, instead of using a unified model for all traffic scenarios, we manage multiple trained models with different sizes tailored to different scenarios.\\nSecondly, we manage the framerate at which a perception model runs, which can directly reduce computational consumption without training additional models. In modern autonomous driving systems, the perception system typically operates at a framerate of 20-30 fps to extract environmental features [ 15 , 16 ] . We argue that such high framerates are not always necessary in all scenarios. For some simple scenarios (e.g., good weather condition and low traffic density), appropriately lowering the framerate does not compromise driving performance but can greatly reduce perception consumption. After frame reduction, we also consider using interpolation methods to fill in the features of skipped frames to keep the temporal granularity consistent.\\n(2) As shown in Figure 1 , we define the above adjustable parameters as tunable knobs (i.e., perception model, framerate, and interpolation method) in the perception system where each knob has a set of candidate values. We refer to a particular combination of knob values as a configuration and there are m 3 m^{3} configurations assuming each knob has m m candidate values.\\nDifferent configurations have different levels of computational consumption and accuracy.\\nWe set an accuracy requirement for feature extraction in the perception system and expect to find low-computation configurations while achieving the accuracy requirement. The optimal configuration of a traffic scenario is the one with the lowest computational consumption and over the accuracy.\\nHowever, implementing such a perception optimization framework within autonomous driving is non-trivial, which faces three main challenges:\\nChallenge I: Diverse traffic scenarios. The optimal configuration varies across different traffic scenarios. A low-computation configuration in simple scenarios is enough to achieve high accuracy, while in more complex traffic scenarios, a configuration with larger computation is required to maintain accuracy.\\nTherefore, it is necessary to distinguish the perception difficulty of different traffic scenarios and separately search the corresponding optimal configurations.\\nChallenge II: Large configuration space. The number of configurations m 3 m^{3} grows rapidly with the number m m of candidate values for each knob. Although the computational consumption of a configuration can be estimated, obtaining accuracy requires running the configuration on hours or days of raw perception data. As a result, it is cost-prohibit to run all configurations in each scenario to find the optimal one.\\nChallenge III: Decision robustness. Although there is an accuracy requirement during perception optimization, the extracted object features are inevitably perturbed. Therefore, the robustness of autonomous driving decisions needs to be enhanced to avoid some risky driving behaviors.\\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework, called EneAD , which includes an adaptive perception module and a robust decision module.\\n(1) To address Challenge I , a lightweight classification model is built to distinguish the perception difficulty of traffic scenarios, alongside an uncertainty value to enhance the model’s reliability, where a scenario with a large uncertainty will be treated as the one with the highest difficulty.\\nUltimately, traffic scenarios are grouped into several difficulty levels, allowing the configuration optimization to focus on each level instead of on each single scenario.\\n(2) To address Challenge II , we adopt Bayesian optimization instead of exhaustive search for knob tuning, which can find optimal/near-optimal configurations by evaluating only partial configurations. Further, we design a meta-learning strategy to transfer tuning knowledge across different types of traffic scenarios, further speeding up the tuning process.\\n(3) To address Challenge III , we model the decision-making task as a Markov decision process and design a regularization technique to prevent large policy updates, thus enhancing decision robustness.\\nTo sum up, the adaptive perception module aims to reduce the energy consumption of the perception system, while the robust decision module aims to optimize driving decisions. In addition, since the robust decision module can lead to more conservative driving behaviors, we find that the energy consumption of the driving system also decreases to some degree.\\nWe summarize the main contributions as follows:\\n∙ \\\\bullet We develop an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework, called EneAD , to adaptively reduce the energy consumption of the perception system while maintaining good driving performance.\\n∙ \\\\bullet We tune the perception model, framerate, and interpolation method in the perception system and set them as knobs. Afterward, we design a meta-learning strategy within Bayesian optimization to explore promising configurations with low computational consumption and sufficient accuracy.\\n∙ \\\\bullet We design a lightweight and reliable classification model to distinguish the perception difficulty of traffic scenarios.\\n∙ \\\\bullet We design a regularization technique to enhance the decision robustness of autonomous driving.\\n∙ \\\\bullet We conduct extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, evidencing the superiority of our proposals in both energy consumption and driving performance.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Autonomous driving is recognized as a technology that could herald a major shift in transportation. Typically, there are two methods for building autonomous driving systems: modular and end-to-end. Modular methods leverage a perception module to extract traffic features from sensor data and then make driving decisions based on the perception results, while end-to-end methods attempt to directly map sensor data to driving decisions [ 17 ] . Given that end-to-end methods struggle in complex driving scenarios and lack transparency and explainability [ 18 ] , this study focuses on modular methods. In the following, we will introduce some related works about perception and decision-making and analyze their limitations.\\nPerception Module. Autonomous vehicles mainly rely on cameras and LiDAR for environmental perception [ 12 ] . On the one hand, cameras produce RGB images that can be used to detect color and position features with relatively low computational consumption. However, their detection performance declines sharply under adverse weather and light conditions. On the other hand, while LiDAR demands a higher computational consumption and lacks color information, it can provide reliable depth information with point cloud data and is less affected by environmental factors. Based on them, there are two mainstream perception architectures: camera-only [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] , and multi-modality [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] , where camera-only methods rely solely on camera data, while multi-modality methods combine the sensor data from both cameras and LiDAR.\\nAlthough multi-modality methods can achieve higher perception accuracy, they incur significantly higher computational consumption compared to camera-only methods. Therefore, many studies use model compression techniques, including sparsification, quantization, and distillation, to lower computational consumption by reducing model sizes.\\nHowever, they either continue to have a large model size or the accuracy is considerably inferior to that of the origin\\nmulti-modality model. Recently, a gate-based model [ 5 ] is proposed to adjust the model size of multi-modality methods by adaptively discarding or adding parts of the network. Nonetheless, it struggles to balance computational consumption and accuracy, and training such a model is not trivial.\\nTo sum up, all these existing methods focus solely on training a model with a reduced size. In this study, we intend to optimize autonomous driving perception from the perspective of data management and tuning. Instead of using a unified model for all traffic scenarios, we manage multiple trained models with different sizes, and adjust the framerate at which a perception model runs and the interpolation method after frame reduction.\\nDecision-making Module. After the perception module, the decision-making module is used to generate driving decisions based on the perception results.\\nIn general, the decision-making methods of autonomous driving can be categorized into rule-based and data-driven. Rule-based methods [ 19 , 20 , 21 ] design a set of rule-matching algorithms and kinetic equations to calculate driving actions. However, these methods suffer from limited flexibility in handling complex scenarios with manually defined rules. With the development of artificial intelligence, many data-driven models use neural networks to generate driving actions. Researchers propose to build deep-learning models [ 22 , 23 ] to imitate the driving trajectories [ 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ] of human drivers. Recently, the autonomous driving community has been increasingly embracing reinforcement learning methods [ 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 ] , which are expected to outperform human drivers by continuous trial and error.\\nThe previous work [ 29 ] proposes a reinforcement learning-based method with a parameterized action structure and a hybrid reward function to optimize the safety, efficiency, comfort, and impact on nearby traffic in autonomous driving.\\nUnfortunately, the aforementioned models are based on the assumption of a perfect perception of the traffic environment. In this study, we aim to construct a robust decision-making model when facing perturbed state features from the actual perception system.',\n",

In addition to energy consumption, accuracy is another important metric of the perception module. Different feature extraction models have different levels of accuracy.

These factors are respectively measured by the autonomous vehicle’s time-to-collision (TTC), speed, acceleration change, and deceleration of the vehicle behind it.\\nObjective. Our objective is to adaptively reduce the energy consumption of the autonomous vehicle under a specific perception accuracy, while maintaining good driving performance.\\nIn this study, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework, called EneAD , which includes an adaptive perception module and a robust decision module.

This module aims to reduce the computational consumption of perception computing, which includes a classification model to output a perception difficulty level for each traffic scenario and a knob tuning component to explore promising configurations for each level. Specifically, the classification model is based solely on image data and applies a lightweight neural network Swin-T. Moreover, it also calculates an uncertainty value by Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. When the uncertainty value is greater than a threshold, the output difficulty level will be modified to the highest level to improve the model’s reliability. In the knob tuning component, we first set the perception model, framerate, and interpolation method as knobs in the perception system. Then, Bayesian optimization is adopted for configuration search with two objectives: computational consumption and accuracy.

       "    'paragraphs': 'In this section, we first analyze the limitations of existing scenario classification models and introduce the development of our model. Then, we detail the knob setting in the perception module and the knob tuning model for exploring promising configurations in the configuration space.\\nThe perception difficulty of each traffic scenario is influenced by various environmental factors, including weather conditions, lighting conditions, and traffic density [ 37 ] . In simple scenarios (e.g., sunny days), using only low-computation configurations can achieve a high perception accuracy, while in complex scenarios (e.g., rainy days), high-computation configurations are required to maintain accuracy. Since point cloud data cannot identify lighting conditions that can affect perception, researchers distinguish the perception difficulty of different traffic scenarios solely by the image data quality: higher quality means a lower difficulty level, while lower quality signifies a higher one.\\nIn general, the classification methods can be divided into traditional methods and deep learning methods.\\nThe traditional methods [ 38 , 39 ] use nature scene statistics (NSS) to distinguish images, which can reflect the degree of image distortion based on some handcrafted metrics. With the development of neural networks, deep learning-based methods have drawn much attention for their superior performance. A recent study [ 40 ] proposes using neural networks to encode images and then adopting clustering methods to classify these encoding vectors. Due to the lack of interpretability in clustering rules, many studies [ 41 , 42 , 43 ] utilize deep learning-based models to directly predict the image quality.\\nHowever, directly using these methods in our task usually leads to unsatisfactory results due to the following three limitations:\\n(1) They are general-purpose rather than specific to autonomous driving perception. Specifically, they annotate the image categories according to the degree of image distortion or subjective human scoring, which makes it difficult to accurately reflect the perception difficulty of different traffic scenarios. In contrast, a classification criterion directly related to the quality of subsequent perception results would be better for our scenario classification task.\\n(2) Although these methods can attain relatively high accuracy in scenario classification, their reliability is insufficient. When the autonomous vehicle encounters unseen traffic scenarios, these methods may underestimate the true difficulty level of the scenario. This can mislead our perception system to use low-computational configurations, which may result in a sharp decrease in accuracy and thus raise safety concerns.\\nBased on the above analysis, we will build a task-specific and reliable difficulty classification model based on image data. To achieve this, we first build a dataset dedicated to the autonomous driving perception task, where the image data is automatically labeled based on the quality of perception results after running a unified perception model. Then, to avoid introducing a large computational overhead to the perception system, we use a lightweight model Swin-T [ 44 ] as the main neural network to encode image data. Finally, to enhance the reliability of classification results, we calculate an uncertainty value using the Monte Carlo (MC)\\ndropout technique [ 45 ] , which is a simple and effective implementation of Bayesian neural networks. Next, we introduce the data generation process and model architecture as follows:\\nDataset Generation. Inspired by the previous work [ 46 , 47 ] , we label the perception difficulty of images based on the detection results after running a unified object detection model on them. The images with better detection results are regarded as lower difficulty levels, and the ones with poorer results are regarded as higher levels.\\nTo be detailed, we generate the dataset by the following three steps:\\n(1) Collect image data from a real-world dataset Nuscenes-R [ 16 ] and a high-fidelity synthetic dataset Nuscenes-S [ 48 ] , where the traffic scenarios have various weather conditions and vehicle density. Since the raw image data in each traffic scenario is based on a 360-degree bird’s-eye view consisting of six images from different directions, we stitch these images together as one image instance. Afterward, we split all image instances into a training set and a test set in a ratio of 4 : 1.\\n(2) Run a unified object detection model on raw image data in each traffic scenario and calculate a metric NDS [ 36 ] to evaluate detection performance.\\nSpecifically, we choose SparseBEV [ 6 ] as the detection model, and NDS refers to the Nuscenes detection score that reflects perception accuracy. Generally, more complex scenarios (e.g., worse weather conditions) result in higher perception difficulty, which in turn leads to lower NDS values.\\n(3) Classify all image instances into k k difficulty levels based on their NDS values. We first sort all image instances by their NDS values in ascending order and then divide them into multiple equal groups for simplicity. Taking k = 4 k=4 as an example, the difficulty levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 are allocated to four equal groups, and all image instances within a group are assigned the same difficulty level.\\nIn the end, the scenario classification task in this study is defined as: Given an image instance x x , predict the perception difficulty level y ^ \\\\hat{y} it belongs to, where y ^ ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , k } \\\\hat{y}\\\\in\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,k\\\\} .\\nNetwork Architecture. We introduce the network architecture of our scenario classification model as shown in Figure 3 , and present the calculation formulas in the following.\\nFirstly, we design an image encoder that uses the Swin-T network [ 44 ] to encode the image sample x x , as follows:\\nwhere h h denotes the encoding vector of x x and w 1 w_{1} denotes the learnable network parameters. In the experiment Section VI-C , we find that this lightweight model Swin-T achieves almost the same accuracy as other heavyweight networks.\\nThen, we design a classification head based on Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) to calculate the probability that the image data x x belongs to each difficulty level, as follows:\\nwhere w 2 w_{2} denotes the learnable network parameters, P = [ p 1 , p 2 , … , p k ] P=[p_{1},p_{2},\\\\dots,p_{k}] is a probability vector that respectively indicates the probabilities of k k difficulty levels, and the level with the highest probability is regarded as the predicted level of x x . We use three linear layers in this MLP. Moreover, we use the MC dropout technique [ 49 ] in the MLP to avoid model overfitting in the training phase and obtain uncertainty in the inference phase.\\nIn the training phase, since our scenario classification is a multi-class classification task, we use the cross-entropy loss [ 50 ] as our loss function ℒ 1 \\\\mathcal{L}_{1} , as follows:\\nwhere y y denotes the true difficulty level of the image data x x , and p y p_{y} is the probability assigned to the true level in the probability vector P P . This loss encourages the classification model to maximize the probability of the true level.\\nIn the inference phase, the classification head performs T T forward pass after encoding an image x x in the image encoder, where each forward pass randomly deactivates a specific fraction of neurons. Afterward, we calculate the difficulty level y ^ \\\\hat{y} of x x and an uncertainty value u u , as follows:\\nwhere P i P^{i} denotes the probability vector in the i − i- th forward pass based on Equation 2 , 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 \\\\mathit{argmax} is used to find the difficulty level with the highest average probability as the final classification result y ^ \\\\hat{y} , and p y ^ i p_{\\\\hat{y}}^{i} denotes the probability of y ^ \\\\hat{y} at the i − i- th forward pass.\\nIf the uncertainty value u u is larger than a threshold G G , we will set the difficulty level y ^ \\\\hat{y} to k k (i.e., the highest difficulty level). In the later knob tuning section, the traffic scenarios with a difficulty level of k k will use the highest-computation configuration.\\nTherefore, this operation helps prevent a sharp decline in the perception accuracy caused by incorrect scenario classification results. Also, the additional computation it brings is minimal because we only run the classification head T T times, excluding the image encoder.\\nAfter the above section, all traffic scenarios are classified into k k difficulty levels. For each type, we respectively set three knobs (i.e., perception model, framerate, and interpolation method after frame reduction) that can affect both computational consumption and perception accuracy. To be detailed, we describe these knobs as follows:\\n(1) k \\u200b n \\u200b o \\u200b b 1 knob_{1} : Perception models with different sizes.\\nThis study adopts a series of BEV-based models to extract the surrounding vehicle features (e.g., position and orientation) of the autonomous vehicle.\\nSpecifically, we set the candidate set of k \\u200b n \\u200b o \\u200b b 1 knob_{1} as { 𝑆𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒𝐵𝑒𝑣 , 𝑆𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒𝐹𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 , 𝐵𝑒𝑣𝐹𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 , 𝐵𝑒𝑣𝐹𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 \\u200b - \\u200b e } \\\\{\\\\mathit{SparseBev},\\\\allowbreak\\\\mathit{SparseFusion},\\\\mathit{BevFusion},\\\\mathit{BevFusion}\\\\mathord{-}e\\\\} , where SparseBEV [ 6 ] is a camera-only method, SparseFusion [ 11 ] and BevFusion [ 9 ] are multi-modality methods, and BevFusion-e is the ensemble version of BevFusion, respectively. We implement them based on their open-source code repositories. From left to right, these models have higher computational consumption but higher accuracy.\\n(2) k \\u200b n \\u200b o \\u200b b 2 knob_{2} : Framerate. The onboard cameras and LiDAR in this study capture image data and point cloud data at 20 frames per second. Based on it, we express the frame rate as the number of frames to skip each time before the next run of a perception model. Then, the candidate set for this knob is defined as { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 } \\\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\\\} frames. A larger value results in larger resource savings but larger accuracy degradation.\\n(3) k \\u200b n \\u200b o \\u200b b 3 knob_{3} : Interpolation methods after frame reduction. If the perception framerate is reduced, this study considers using a interpolation method to fill in the vehicle features in skipped frames. The candidate set of k \\u200b n \\u200b o \\u200b b 3 knob_{3} is set as { l \\u200b i \\u200b n \\u200b e \\u200b a \\u200b r , p \\u200b r \\u200b e \\u200b d \\u200b i \\u200b c \\u200b t \\u200b i \\u200b o \\u200b n } \\\\{linear,prediction\\\\} . The linear method assumes that the surrounding vehicle maintains the driving actions of the last time frame [ 51 ] .\\nOn the contrary, the prediction method fills in the missed vehicle features with a trajectory prediction model, following the previous work [ 52 ] . The prediction method has higher computational consumption but higher accuracy for the filled features compared to the linear method.\\nFinally, the number n n of configurations can be calculated as the product of the number of candidate values for these three knobs at k k different scenario difficulty levels, i.e., n = 4 × 10 × 2 × k = 80 \\u200b k n=4\\\\times 10\\\\times 2\\\\times k=80k . Although the computational consumption of a configuration can be estimated, its accuracy is unpredictable and needs to be obtained by running it on raw perception data (i.e., images and/or point cloud data), which demands much computational consumption 1 1 1 We run these configurations on a 5.5-hour dataset, and each configuration takes an average of 14 hours on a GeForce RTX 3090. . Therefore, it is cost-prohibit to run all configurations to get the optimal configuration in each scenario difficulty level.\\nBased on the above, we adopt knob tuning to find optimal/near-optimal configurations by evaluating partial configurations rather than all configurations. Also, there are k k tuning instances corresponding to traffic scenarios of k k perception difficulty levels.\\nThis study adopts multi-objective Bayesian optimization to perform knob tuning, given its superior performance in other tuning tasks [ 53 ] . To further speed up the tuning process, we design a meta-surrogate model to transfer tuning knowledge between different difficulty levels.\\nWe introduce the main components of Bayesian optimization in each tuning instance as follows:\\n(1) Objective Function f \\u200b ( θ ) f(\\\\theta) . We use θ j \\\\theta_{j} to represent a configuration and f i \\u200b ( θ ) f^{i}(\\\\theta) to represent the objective function in a tuning instance i i . In this study, the objective function consists of two objectives, i.e., computational consumption f i \\u200b ( θ ) . c \\u200b o \\u200b m f^{i}(\\\\theta).com and accuracy f i \\u200b ( θ ) . a \\u200b c \\u200b c f^{i}(\\\\theta).acc . To align both objective values with the minimization goal of Bayesian optimization, f i \\u200b ( θ ) . a \\u200b c \\u200b c f^{i}(\\\\theta).acc is the negated value of raw accuracy value.\\n(2) Surrogate Model ℳ \\\\mathcal{M} . We represent the surrogate model in a tuning instance i i as ℳ i = ( θ , f i \\u200b ( θ ) , σ 2 ) \\\\mathcal{M}^{i}=(\\\\theta,f^{i}(\\\\theta),\\\\sigma^{2}) , which can approximate the objective function value f i \\u200b ( θ ) f^{i}(\\\\theta) of each configuration and provide an uncertainty estimation σ 2 \\\\sigma^{2} . It can be continuously updated according to the objective function values of actual evaluated configurations. Since the knob value is discrete, we adopt SMAC (Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration) [ 54 ] as the probability surrogate model.\\n(3) Acquisition function α \\\\alpha . The acquisition function α \\\\alpha is used to decide which configuration to explore based on the surrogate model. To adapt to multiple objectives, we use EHVI (Expected Hypervolume Improvement) [ 55 ] as the acquisition function.\\nAt each tuning iteration, we first obtain a configuration using the acquisition function α i \\\\alpha^{i} . Then, we run the configuration to get its objective function values, based on which the surrogate model is updated. As more tuning iterations are done, the surrogate model becomes more accurate, and the acquisition function directs the search toward the optimal solution.\\nMeta-surrogate Model. Based on the above, there are k k independent tuning instances for traffic scenarios with different perception difficulty levels. Each tuning instance needs to explore and run explored configurations separately and update its surrogate model from scratch. In this study, we design a meta-surrogate model to reduce the number of tuning iterations by warm-starting a new tuning instance with the previous tuned instances. However, directly transferring the surrogate model from other tuning instances is not feasible, as their output accuracy values differ in scale.\\nThat is, the magnitude of accuracy values for the same configuration diverges sharply across tuning instances of scenarios with different perception difficulty levels.\\nTo address this, we adopt a simple strategy that normalizes the accuracy value within each tuning instance. As a result, the output accuracy of each surrogate model is a relative value rather than an absolute one. The relative relationships in the objective value between configurations can still provide valuable insights in different tuning instances [ 56 ] . Finally, we will detail the main steps of this transfer strategy.\\n(1) Normalize objective values. To normalize the objective function in a tuning instance i i , we first run the lowest-computation configuration θ l \\\\theta_{l} and the highest-computation configuration θ h \\\\theta_{h} to get their objective values. Then, we use min-max normalization to normalize the objective function values as f ¯ i \\u200b ( θ j ) . c \\u200b o \\u200b m \\\\overline{f}^{i}(\\\\theta_{j}).com and f ¯ i \\u200b ( θ j ) . a \\u200b c \\u200b c \\\\overline{f}^{i}(\\\\theta_{j}).acc .\\n(2) Construct meta-surrogate model.\\nWe use ℳ i \\\\mathcal{M}^{i} ( i = 1 , 2 , … , k i=1,2,\\\\dots,k ) to represent the surrogate models in k k tuning instances and execute them sequentially. The first tuning instance still starts tuning from scratch. But for subsequent tuning tasks, we build a meta-surrogate model ℳ m \\u200b e \\u200b t \\u200b a \\\\mathcal{M}^{meta} using the previously tuned instances. For example, assuming we will execute the i i -th ( i > 1 i>1 ) tuning instances, we initialize the objective function f ¯ m \\u200b e \\u200b t \\u200b a \\u200b ( θ ) \\\\overline{f}^{meta}(\\\\theta) as follows.\\nwhere f ¯ m \\u200b e \\u200b t \\u200b a \\u200b ( θ ) \\\\overline{f}^{meta}(\\\\theta) is the average of the objective functions of all previously tuned tasks, and we use it to initialize the surrogate model ℳ i \\\\mathcal{M}^{i} . In this way, ℳ i \\\\mathcal{M}^{i} can be represented as ℳ i = ℳ m \\u200b e \\u200b t \\u200b a = ( θ , f ¯ m \\u200b e \\u200b t \\u200b a \\u200b ( θ ) , σ 2 ) \\\\mathcal{M}^{i}=\\\\mathcal{M}^{meta}=(\\\\theta,\\\\overline{f}^{meta}(\\\\theta),\\\\sigma^{2}) . Note that the uncertainty estimation σ 2 \\\\sigma^{2} is initialized with the default method [ 54 ] to guide the exploration in the configuration space.\\nWe present the entire tuning process in Algorithm 1 . At first, we define five accuracy requirements, 𝒜 i \\u200b ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ) \\\\mathcal{A}_{i}\\\\ (i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) , corresponding to NDS values of 0.69, 0.70, 0.71, 0.72, 0.73, 0.74, 0.75, and 0.76 2 2 2 The most expensive model BevFusion-e [ 9 ] in our experiment can only achieve an NDS of 0.761. After the experiment, we chose 0.74 as the final accuracy requirement, which achieves a good balance between energy consumption and driving performance. , respectively.\\nThen, the pseudocode in lines 2 − 5 2-5 shows the meta-surrogate model construction at the beginning of a tuning instance. The pseudocode in lines 6 − 18 6-18 shows the tuning process, where the acquisition function is used to select the next configuration to explore, and the surrogate model is updated with normalized objective values. During tuning, we maintain a configuration dictionary 𝔻 \\\\mathbb{D} to save the current lowest-computation configurations under different accuracy requirements in different tuning instances. If all configurations fail to reach a certain accuracy in a tuning instance, its configuration in the dictionary will be set to the highest-computation one. Finally, we will terminate a tuning instance when it converges or the maximum number of configurations N = 80 N=80 is reached.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'The perception difficulty of each traffic scenario is influenced by various environmental factors, including weather conditions, lighting conditions, and traffic density [ 37 ] . In simple scenarios (e.g., sunny days), using only low-computation configurations can achieve a high perception accuracy, while in complex scenarios (e.g., rainy days), high-computation configurations are required to maintain accuracy. Since point cloud data cannot identify lighting conditions that can affect perception, researchers distinguish the perception difficulty of different traffic scenarios solely by the image data quality: higher quality means a lower difficulty level, while lower quality signifies a higher one.\\nIn general, the classification methods can be divided into traditional methods and deep learning methods.\\nThe traditional methods [ 38 , 39 ] use nature scene statistics (NSS) to distinguish images, which can reflect the degree of image distortion based on some handcrafted metrics. With the development of neural networks, deep learning-based methods have drawn much attention for their superior performance. A recent study [ 40 ] proposes using neural networks to encode images and then adopting clustering methods to classify these encoding vectors. Due to the lack of interpretability in clustering rules, many studies [ 41 , 42 , 43 ] utilize deep learning-based models to directly predict the image quality.\\nHowever, directly using these methods in our task usually leads to unsatisfactory results due to the following three limitations:\\n(1) They are general-purpose rather than specific to autonomous driving perception. Specifically, they annotate the image categories according to the degree of image distortion or subjective human scoring, which makes it difficult to accurately reflect the perception difficulty of different traffic scenarios. In contrast, a classification criterion directly related to the quality of subsequent perception results would be better for our scenario classification task.\\n(2) Although these methods can attain relatively high accuracy in scenario classification, their reliability is insufficient. When the autonomous vehicle encounters unseen traffic scenarios, these methods may underestimate the true difficulty level of the scenario. This can mislead our perception system to use low-computational configurations, which may result in a sharp decrease in accuracy and thus raise safety concerns.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'Based on the above analysis, we will build a task-specific and reliable difficulty classification model based on image data. To achieve this, we first build a dataset dedicated to the autonomous driving perception task, where the image data is automatically labeled based on the quality of perception results after running a unified perception model. Then, to avoid introducing a large computational overhead to the perception system, we use a lightweight model Swin-T [ 44 ] as the main neural network to encode image data. Finally, to enhance the reliability of classification results, we calculate an uncertainty value using the Monte Carlo (MC)\\ndropout technique [ 45 ] , which is a simple and effective implementation of Bayesian neural networks. Next, we introduce the data generation process and model architecture as follows:\\nDataset Generation. Inspired by the previous work [ 46 , 47 ] , we label the perception difficulty of images based on the detection results after running a unified object detection model on them. The images with better detection results are regarded as lower difficulty levels, and the ones with poorer results are regarded as higher levels.\\nTo be detailed, we generate the dataset by the following three steps:\\n(1) Collect image data from a real-world dataset Nuscenes-R [ 16 ] and a high-fidelity synthetic dataset Nuscenes-S [ 48 ] , where the traffic scenarios have various weather conditions and vehicle density. Since the raw image data in each traffic scenario is based on a 360-degree bird’s-eye view consisting of six images from different directions, we stitch these images together as one image instance. Afterward, we split all image instances into a training set and a test set in a ratio of 4 : 1.\\n(2) Run a unified object detection model on raw image data in each traffic scenario and calculate a metric NDS [ 36 ] to evaluate detection performance.\\nSpecifically, we choose SparseBEV [ 6 ] as the detection model, and NDS refers to the Nuscenes detection score that reflects perception accuracy. Generally, more complex scenarios (e.g., worse weather conditions) result in higher perception difficulty, which in turn leads to lower NDS values.\\n(3) Classify all image instances into k k difficulty levels based on their NDS values. We first sort all image instances by their NDS values in ascending order and then divide them into multiple equal groups for simplicity. Taking k = 4 k=4 as an example, the difficulty levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 are allocated to four equal groups, and all image instances within a group are assigned the same difficulty level.\\nIn the end, the scenario classification task in this study is defined as: Given an image instance x x , predict the perception difficulty level y ^ \\\\hat{y} it belongs to, where y ^ ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , k } \\\\hat{y}\\\\in\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,k\\\\} .\\nNetwork Architecture. We introduce the network architecture of our scenario classification model as shown in Figure 3 , and present the calculation formulas in the following.\\nFirstly, we design an image encoder that uses the Swin-T network [ 44 ] to encode the image sample x x , as follows:\\nwhere h h denotes the encoding vector of x x and w 1 w_{1} denotes the learnable network parameters. In the experiment Section VI-C , we find that this lightweight model Swin-T achieves almost the same accuracy as other heavyweight networks.\\nThen, we design a classification head based on Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) to calculate the probability that the image data x x belongs to each difficulty level, as follows:\\nwhere w 2 w_{2} denotes the learnable network parameters, P = [ p 1 , p 2 , … , p k ] P=[p_{1},p_{2},\\\\dots,p_{k}] is a probability vector that respectively indicates the probabilities of k k difficulty levels, and the level with the highest probability is regarded as the predicted level of x x . We use three linear layers in this MLP. Moreover, we use the MC dropout technique [ 49 ] in the MLP to avoid model overfitting in the training phase and obtain uncertainty in the inference phase.\\nIn the training phase, since our scenario classification is a multi-class classification task, we use the cross-entropy loss [ 50 ] as our loss function ℒ 1 \\\\mathcal{L}_{1} , as follows:\\nwhere y y denotes the true difficulty level of the image data x x , and p y p_{y} is the probability assigned to the true level in the probability vector P P . This loss encourages the classification model to maximize the probability of the true level.\\nIn the inference phase, the classification head performs T T forward pass after encoding an image x x in the image encoder, where each forward pass randomly deactivates a specific fraction of neurons. Afterward, we calculate the difficulty level y ^ \\\\hat{y} of x x and an uncertainty value u u , as follows:\\nwhere P i P^{i} denotes the probability vector in the i − i- th forward pass based on Equation 2 , 𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥 \\\\mathit{argmax} is used to find the difficulty level with the highest average probability as the final classification result y ^ \\\\hat{y} , and p y ^ i p_{\\\\hat{y}}^{i} denotes the probability of y ^ \\\\hat{y} at the i − i- th forward pass.\\nIf the uncertainty value u u is larger than a threshold G G , we will set the difficulty level y ^ \\\\hat{y} to k k (i.e., the highest difficulty level). In the later knob tuning section, the traffic scenarios with a difficulty level of k k will use the highest-computation configuration.\\nTherefore, this operation helps prevent a sharp decline in the perception accuracy caused by incorrect scenario classification results. Also, the additional computation it brings is minimal because we only run the classification head T T times, excluding the image encoder.',\n",

Firstly, we model the decision-making problem under Markov decision process (MDP).\\nThen, we design a regularization technique to enhance the decision-making robustness when facing perturbed state features.\\nMarkov decision process (MDP) can be defined as: ℳ = ⟨ 𝒮 , 𝒜 , 𝒫 , ℛ ⟩ \\\\mathcal{M}=\\\\langle{\\\\mathcal{S},\\\\mathcal{A}},\\\\mathcal{P},\\\\mathcal{R}\\\\rangle , which includes four key elements: state 𝒮 \\\\mathcal{S} , action 𝒜 \\\\mathcal{A} , state transition probability 𝒫 \\\\mathcal{P} and reward ℛ \\\\mathcal{R} .

Following the previous work [ 32 ] , the safety factor is measured by time-to-collision (TTC) of the autonomous vehicle, which denotes the time span left before a collision. The efficiency factor and the comfort factor are measured by the velocity and acceleration change rate of the autonomous vehicle. The impact factor is measured by the passive deceleration of the rear traffic flow caused by the autonomous vehicle.\\nFigure 4 shows the architecture of our reinforcement learning model, which includes an action network and a value network. Specifically, the actor network incorporates a parameterized action schema [ 58 ] , outputting three action values (i.e., a l \\u200b l t a_{ll}^{t} , a l \\u200b r t a_{lr}^{t} , and a l \\u200b k t a_{lk}^{t} 3 3 3 Each action includes a steering angle value and a velocity change value. ) at each time step that correspond to three lane-changing decisions (i.e., left lane-changing l \\u200b l ll , right lane-changing l \\u200b r lr , and lane-keeping l \\u200b k lk ). The value network outputs the Q values of the three actions, and the action with the highest Q value is the final action performed by the autonomous vehicle.\\nTo solve the parameterized action schema, researchers propose many reinforcement learning methods [ 59 , 60 , 58 , 29 , 61 ] to learn an action policy. Specifically, the P-DDPG method [ 60 ] collapses the parameterized action space into a continuous one. However, it does not account for which action is associated with which lane-changing decision, leading to suboptimal action policies. Recently, the P-DQN method [ 58 ] is proposed to directly generate multiple actions, and each action is associated with a decision. Benefiting from this, P-DQN can learn a better action policy under the parameterized action structure. To improve the robustness when facing perturbed state features, the RP-DQN method [ 29 ] adds a regularization term into the actor network to stabilize the update process of the action network. However, this method does not consider the extrapolation error that can lead to the misestimation problem of Q values of state-action pairs [ 62 ] . Specifically, the Q value in reinforcement learning is used to estimate the expected reward when performing an action based on certain state features. Since the values of state features and action are continuous in this work, the number of state-action pairs is infinite. During the learning process, the reinforcement learning agent inevitably encounters some state-action pairs that significantly differ from those it has previously seen. In such cases, the agent tends to estimate their Q-values incorrectly. This in turn affects policy improvement, where the agent learns to prefer poor actions, leading to potential safety risks in autonomous driving. Therefore, this study proposes a regularization technique to restrain the learning process of Q values, making the exploration of state-action pairs stay close to those previously seen.\\nNext, we will introduce the loss functions with a regularization term in the actor and value networks.\\nWe represent an explored experience as e t = ( s t , a h 1 t , r t , s t + 1 , a h 2 t + 1 ) e^{t}=(s^{t},a^{t}_{h_{1}},r^{t},s^{t+1},a^{t+1}_{h_{2}}) that denote the current state, action, reward, the next state and action, respectively. h 1 h_{1} and h 2 h_{2} denote the selected lane-changing decisions of a h 1 t a^{t}_{h_{1}} and a h 2 t a^{t}_{h_{2}} , respectively.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Dataset. We simulate the entire autonomous driving pipeline on the Carla simulator 4 4 4 https://carla.org/ , which is a widely used project focused on creating a publicly available virtual environment for autonomous driving [ 57 ] . It supports almost all sensors (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with the goal of flexibility and realism in high-fidelity simulations. In the adaptive perception module, we use both a real-world dataset Nuscenes-R [ 16 ] and a synthetic dataset Nuscenes-S [ 48 ] . Specifically, Nuscenes-R has 5.5-hour perception data where the framerate of annotated scenarios is only 2 fps. Nuscenes-S is generated with Carla, simulating the sensor and scenario setting in Nuscenes-R but with annotated scenarios at 20 fps. We use both datasets to train and test our scenario difficulty classification model but only use Nuscenes-S for knob tuning since the framerate of annotated scenes in Nuscenes-R is too low. For our decision-making model, we use the simulated dataset REAL in the previous work [ 29 ] , which contains 55 different driving routes with various weather conditions and traffic density. Finally, we split all the above datasets into training sets and test sets with a splitting ratio of 4 : 1.\\nImplementation Details. In the adaptive perception module, we set the number k k of perception difficulty levels in our scenario classification model to 4. For the classification head, we use three linear layers in the multi-layer perceptron, and their dimensions are set as 256, 128, and 64, respectively. To calculate uncertainty, the dropout rate is set as 0.5, the classification head performs 10 forward passes, and the threshold G G of uncertainty values is set as 0.02. To the end, we train the classification model using the Adam optimizer [ 64 ] with a learning rate of 0.01 and a batch size of 128.

In the end, we train the reinforcement learning model using the Adam optimizer [ 64 ] with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 128. Our experiments are conducted on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs.\\nBaselines. We compared our framework with five methods, including one standard perception-and-decision autonomous driving method and four model compression methods.\\n(1) Auto [ 29 ] .\\nA standard perception-and-decision framework for autonomous driving, which perceives the traffic environment with BevFusion [ 9 ] and makes driving decisions by a reinforcement learning model RBP-DQN.\\n(2) Sparse [ 6 ] .\\nIt reduces computing consumption by using sparse representations that only focus on the relevant and non-empty areas of BEV representations.\\n(3) Quantize [ 13 ] .\\nIt reduces computing consumption by lowering the precision of floating-point numbers from single-precision to half-precision.\\n(4) Distill [ 14 ] .\\nIt reduces computing consumption by distilling knowledge from a large multi-modality model to a smaller model.\\n(5) EcoFusion [ 5 ] .\\nIt can vary the model size of multi-modality methods by discarding or adding\\nparts of the network, thus altering computational consumption and accuracy.\\nHowever, Sparse, Quantize, Distill, and EcoFusion only focus on perception optimization but do not consider the impact of reduced perception computing on subsequent autonomous driving decision performance. Therefore, we plug them into the autonomous driving pipeline of Auto to evaluate their driving performance.\\nIn this section, we study the end-to-end performance 5 5 5 The result is based on the accuracy requirement of 0.74. of our framework EneAD by comparing it against the baselines from two aspects: energy consumption and driving performance.\\nFirstly, we design three metrics to evaluate the energy consumption of the autonomous vehicle, as follows:\\n(1) Average Energy consumption of perception system (Ene-P). We record the power consumption per 100 kilometers brought by the perception system of the autonomous vehicle. To avoid interference from other processes and hardware factors, we measure it based on the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) following the\\nprevious method [ 3 , 34 ] . We also use equivalent computational units for method Quantize, where one FP16 operation is counted as 0.5 FP32 operations\\n(2) Average Energy consumption of driving system (Ene-D). We record the power consumption per 100 kilometers (km) brought by the driving system of the autonomous vehicle. It is influenced by many factors, such as vehicle speed and acceleration, and we obtain it by the SUMO platform following the previous method [ 35 ] .\\n(3) Average Driving range (DR). We record the driving range (km) of the autonomous vehicle per kwh, considering only the energy consumption of the perception system and driving system.\\nThen, we design four metrics, following the previous work [ 66 , 32 ] , to evaluate the driving performance (i.e., safety, efficiency, comfort, and impact) of the autonomous vehicle, as follows:\\n(1)\\nPercentage of time-to-collision values with potential collision risks (TTC-R). We record the time-to-collision values of the autonomous vehicle and count the percentage of TTCs less than 4 seconds that are regarded as having potential collision risk following the previous work [ 66 ] . A smaller TTC-R indicates that the autonomous vehicle is safer.\\n(2)\\nAverage velocity (VEL).\\nWe record the average velocity of the autonomous vehicle. A larger VEL indicates higher traffic efficiency.\\n(3)\\nAverage acceleration change (AC).\\nWe record the average acceleration change of the autonomous vehicle. A smaller AC indicates a more comfortable driving experience.\\n(4)\\nAverage deceleration (DEC). After the autonomous vehicle performs abrupt braking or lane-changing behaviors, we record the deceleration of the rear vehicle.\\nA smaller DEC means that the autonomous vehicle has less impact on the rear vehicle.\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we present these metrics under different traffic densities (i.e., low: < 10 \\u200b v \\u200b e \\u200b h / k \\u200b m / l \\u200b n <10veh/km/ln , medium: 10 − 30 \\u200b v \\u200b e \\u200b h / k \\u200b m / l \\u200b n 10-30veh/km/ln , and high: > 30 \\u200b v \\u200b e \\u200b h / k \\u200b m / l \\u200b n >30veh/km/ln ).\\nFirstly, we report the metrics of energy consumption in Figure 5 , 6 , and 7 . For power consumption of the perception system in Figure 5 , we can see that our framework EneAD achieves the smallest Ene-P, demonstrating that EneAD can achieve the lowest perception consumption. Among these baselines, the Auto method has the largest Ene-P since it does not consider reducing the perception consumption. In addition, although the model compression methods Sparse, Quantize, Distill, and EcoFusion can achieve a smaller Ene-P than Auto, they also have larger Ene-P values than our framework since they do not consider adjusting the framerate at which perception models run.\\nAfterward, in Figure 6 we can see that our framework EneAD has the smallest Ene-D, which demonstrates that EneAD can also lower the power consumption of the driving system. This is because our robust decision module can generate relatively conservative driving behaviors with smoother velocity changes.\\nThe poor performance of Sparse, Quantize, Distill, and EcoFusion is attributed to their inferior perception accuracies in challenging traffic scenarios, leading to more sudden speed changes that can increase power consumption.\\nFinally, we show the driving range metric DR in Figure 7 . Since EneAD has the lowest power consumption of both the perception and driving system, it can achieve the largest driving range per kwh.\\nTo sum up, our framework EneAD can achieve a 1.9 × − 3.5 × 1.9\\\\times-3.5\\\\times reduction of perception consumption, a slight reduction of the driving system, and a 3.9 % − 8.5 % 3.9\\\\%-8.5\\\\% increase of driving range.\\nSecondly, we report the metrics in Figure 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 . None of the methods cause any collision in the test phase. For safety in Figure 8 , we observe that our framework EneAD has a TTC-R as small as the one achieved by Auto with the highest computational consumption. In addition, a smaller VEL in Figure 9 indicates that EneAD has a slight decrease compared to Auto in driving efficiency, and the smallest AC and DEC in Figure 10 and 11 indicate that EneAD can improve comfort and reduce disturbance to traffic flow. This is due to our robust decision module, which includes a regularization term to constrain the Q function updates in the presence of perturbed state features. It can avoid overestimating the Q values of aggressive driving actions, making the autonomous vehicle drive more smoothly.\\nThe poor performance of Sparse, Quantize, Distill, and EcoFusion is caused by their unstable difficulty levels of the perception results and the lack of constraints on the Q function updates.\\nTo sum up, although our framework EneAD can achieve a substantial decrease in computational consumption, EneAD can still maintain high safety as Auto and achieve the best performance in comfort and impact, with a slight decrease in traffic efficiency.\\nOverall, the above results indicate that our framework yields substantial energy savings across all traffic densities while preserving strong driving performance.\\nThe adaptive perception module is used to reduce the energy consumption of perception computing. To achieve this, we first propose a classification model to distinguish perception difficulty levels of different traffic scenarios and then design a transferable tuning paradigm to explore energy-efficient knob configurations under different accuracy requirements.\\nEvaluation of Scenario Classification Model. Firstly, our classification model is based on the image encoder Swin-T [ 44 ] , which is a hierarchical transformer that combines local attention with shifted windows. To evidence its effectiveness and efficiency in our task, we compare it with the following image encoders: (1) ViT [ 43 ] . Vision transformer that leverages global attention for superior context understanding on image patches. (2) MobileNet [ 67 ] . Lightweight convolution network that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce computation. (3) ResNet50 [ 68 ] . Convolution network that introduces residual connections for deep networks.\\nThen, we design two metrics as follows: (1) Ene-Q. Average power consumption of scenario classification, which is calculated in the same way as Ene-P of the perception system. (2) Accuracy. The percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances.\\nWe report these metrics of our method and the baselines in Table II . As shown, ViT has the highest accuracy but requires a very large computational consumption. MobileNet is the most lightweight model but has a significant drop in accuracy. ResNet50 and our method with Swin-T have nearly the same computational consumption, but the accuracy of our method is much higher than the one of ResNet50. Overall, our method achieves the best balance between computational consumption and accuracy for scenario difficulty classification.\\nBesides a classification result, we also output an uncertainty value by adopting Monte Carlo dropout in the classification head. When the uncertainty value of a classification result is greater than 0.02, we regard this result as ”uncertain” and adjust it to the highest difficulty level.\\nIn Table I , we present the percentage of overestimated, underestimated, and correct classification results among the uncertain results. As shown, 35.6% of the uncertain results are overestimated, 52.1% are underestimated, and 12.3% are correct. Therefore, our uncertainty estimation operation is effective in finding uncertain classification results.\\nEvaluation of Knob Tuning Method. To explore promising configurations, we use Bayesian optimization as the tuning paradigm and propose a meta-surrogate model to transfer tuning knowledge between different tuning instances.\\nTo evaluate the tuning performance, we compared it with two tuning methods and a variant of our method as follows:\\n(1) Heuristic [ 69 ] . A greedy local search method that searches from multiple random configurations and evaluates neighboring configurations to find a better one.\\n(2) RL-based [ 70 ] . A reinforcement learning-based tuning method that uses neural networks to approximate the configuration-accuracy relationship and select the next configuration to evaluate.\\n(3) w/o-meta. A variant that removes the meta-surrogate model. Instead, it starts tuning from scratch using an initial surrogate model. To evaluate their tuning performance, we record the normalized computational consumption (named Normalized C-C) of the current optimal configurations under multiple accuracy requirements (detailed in Section IV-D ) and average them.\\nIn Figure 13 , we plot the tuning curves of Heuristic, RL-based, w/o-meta within 60 tuning iterations. All methods start tuning from scratch. As shown, w/o-meta reaches the optimal value fastest compared to Heuristic and RL-based, demonstrating the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization in our tuning task. In addition, to evidence the effectiveness of our meta-surrogate model, we compare the tuning performance of w/o-meta and our complete method in Figure 13 . Their tuning curves are based on the second tuning instance. In this study, there are k k tuning instances corresponding to k k difficulty levels. If using our complete method with the meta-surrogate model, the second instance can transfer tuning knowledge from the first instance. As shown, our complete method can reach the optimal value after 25 tuning iterations, fewer than the 40 iterations of w/o-meta, proving that the meta-surrogate model is effective in transferring tuning knowledge and thus speeds up the tuning process.\\nEffect of Accuracy Requirements. Our knob tuning model can search for promising configurations under multiple accuracy requirements, i.e., 𝒜 i , i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\\\mathcal{A}_{i},\\\\ i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 , with a NDS value of 0.69, 0.70, 0.71, 0.72, 0.73, 0.74, 0.75, 0.76, respectively. After the tuning converges, we retrieve the final configuration settings in the configuration dictionary and present their computational consumption of the perception system (Ene-P) and the driving system (Ene-D), and safety metric (TTC-R) in Figure 14 . As shown, a lower accuracy requirement results in lower computational consumption of the perception system, while the consumption of the driving system increases and the safety deteriorates. Specifically, the high accuracies 𝒜 7 \\\\mathcal{A}_{7} and 𝒜 8 \\\\mathcal{A}_{8} significantly increase perception computation but offer limited optimization for other metrics. The low accuracies 𝒜 1 − 𝒜 4 \\\\mathcal{A}_{1}-\\\\mathcal{A}_{4} drastically reduce the stability and safety of autonomous driving, while 𝒜 5 \\\\mathcal{A}_{5} and 𝒜 6 \\\\mathcal{A}_{6} can achieve a well-balanced performance across all metrics.\\nUnless otherwise specified, the results in other experiments are based on the accuracy requirement 𝒜 6 = 0.74 \\\\mathcal{A}_{6}=0.74 .\\nConfiguration Setting at Different Difficulty Levels. In Table III , we present the knob values of configurations in different perception difficulty levels after tuning. In this study, we set four levels (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4), and a higher difficulty level corresponding to a more challenging traffic scenario (e.g., adverse weather conditions).\\nAs shown in the table, for high difficulty levels, knob values with high computation are required to achieve a desired accuracy as much as possible. Conversely, for low difficulty levels, knob values with low computation are sufficient to meet the accuracy requirement.\\nIn addition, we find that only scenarios with levels 1, 2, and 3 have reduced configurations, while scenarios with level 4 still maintain the highest-computation configuration. This is because even with the highest-computation configuration, these scenarios still only achieve an accuracy of 0.72, failing to meet our accuracy requirement of 0.74.\\nTo address it, more research breakthroughs in autonomous driving perception models are needed in the future.\\nEvaluation of Configuration Switching. In our experiments, the system switches configurations an average of 2.3 times per kilometer. However, in real-world driving scenarios, this frequency is expected to be lower, since real environments typically feature larger, more continuous scenes (e.g., long highways or urban blocks) and fewer abrupt transitions.\\nSince all models are resident in memory, switching between them incurs negligible latency, enabling adaptive perception with seamless model transitions.\\nIn our framework, the robust decision module is used to make driving decisions based on the perturbed perception results from our adaptive perception module. It proposes a reinforcement learning model to generate driving actions with a parameterized action structure and a regularization term.\\nEvaluation of Reinforcement Learning Models We compared our method with three reinforcement learning methods as follows:\\n(1) P-DDPG [ 60 ] . Deep deterministic policy gradient method that collapses the parameterized action structure into a continuous one.\\n(2) P-DQN [ 58 ] . Parameterized deep Q-learning method that directly learns the parameterized action structure,\\n(3) RP-DQN [ 29 ] . An improved P-DQN model that only restrains the update of the actor network.\\nThen, we show the driving performance (i.e., safety metric TTC-R, efficiency metric VEL, comfort metric AC, impact metric DEC) of these methods under all traffic densities in Table IV . As shown, our method has the lowest TTC-R, AC, and DEC, demonstrating it achieves the best performance in safety, comfort, and impact compared to other methods. However, the VEL of our method has a slight decrease compared to RBP-DQN. The results indicate that our reinforcement learning can make the autonomous vehicle more cautious when facing perturbed state features, leading to larger distances from other vehicles and smoother velocity changes. The performance of RBP-DQN arises from the lack of regularization in updating Q values, leading to the misestimation of Q values of some aggressive driving actions. In addition, the poor performance of P-DDPG and P-DQN is because their model architectures struggle to optimize the action policy stably.',\n",

Nuscenes-S is generated with Carla, simulating the sensor and scenario setting in Nuscenes-R but with annotated scenarios at 20 fps. We use both datasets to train and test our scenario difficulty classification model but only use Nuscenes-S for knob tuning since the framerate of annotated scenes in Nuscenes-R is too low. For our decision-making model, we use the simulated dataset REAL in the previous work [ 29 ] , which contains 55 different driving routes with various weather conditions and traffic density. Finally, we split all the above datasets into training sets and test sets with a splitting ratio of 4 : 1.\\nImplementation Details. In the adaptive perception module, we set the number k k of perception difficulty levels in our scenario classification model to 4. For the classification head, we use three linear layers in the multi-layer perceptron, and their dimensions are set as 256, 128, and 64, respectively. To calculate uncertainty, the dropout rate is set as 0.5, the classification head performs 10 forward passes, and the threshold G G of uncertainty values is set as 0.02. To the end, we train the classification model using the Adam optimizer [ 64 ] with a learning rate of 0.01 and a batch size of 128. In the knob tuning section, the accuracy requirements 𝒜 i \\u200b ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ) \\\\mathcal{A}_{i}\\\\ (i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) are set to 0.69, 0.70, 0.71, 0.72, 0.73, 0.74, 0.75, and 0.76, respectively.\\nIn the robust decision-making module, the actor network and value network use a\\nsoft update mechanism and an updated ratio of 0.01 similar to DDPG [ 65 ] , and the dimensions of the linear layers in the multi-layer perceptron are set to 64.\\nThe reward discount factor γ \\\\gamma in the Bellman function is 0.9, and the coefficient β 1 \\\\beta_{1} in the regularization term is set to 0.4. In the end, we train the reinforcement learning model using the Adam optimizer [ 64 ] with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 128. Our experiments are conducted on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs.\\nBaselines. We compared our framework with five methods, including one standard perception-and-decision autonomous driving method and four model compression methods.\\n(1) Auto [ 29 ] .\\nA standard perception-and-decision framework for autonomous driving, which perceives the traffic environment with BevFusion [ 9 ] and makes driving decisions by a reinforcement learning model RBP-DQN.\\n(2) Sparse [ 6 ] .\\nIt reduces computing consumption by using sparse representations that only focus on the relevant and non-empty areas of BEV representations.\\n(3) Quantize [ 13 ] .\\nIt reduces computing consumption by lowering the precision of floating-point numbers from single-precision to half-precision.\\n(4) Distill [ 14 ] .\\nIt reduces computing consumption by distilling knowledge from a large multi-modality model to a smaller model.\\n(5) EcoFusion [ 5 ] .\\nIt can vary the model size of multi-modality methods by discarding or adding\\nparts of the network, thus altering computational consumption and accuracy.\\nHowever, Sparse, Quantize, Distill, and EcoFusion only focus on perception optimization but do not consider the impact of reduced perception computing on subsequent autonomous driving decision performance. Therefore, we plug them into the autonomous driving pipeline of Auto to evaluate their driving performance.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'In this section, we study the end-to-end performance 5 5 5 The result is based on the accuracy requirement of 0.74. of our framework EneAD by comparing it against the baselines from two aspects: energy consumption and driving performance.\\nFirstly, we design three metrics to evaluate the energy consumption of the autonomous vehicle, as follows:\\n(1) Average Energy consumption of perception system (Ene-P). We record the power consumption per 100 kilometers brought by the perception system of the autonomous vehicle. To avoid interference from other processes and hardware factors, we measure it based on the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) following the\\nprevious method [ 3 , 34 ] . We also use equivalent computational units for method Quantize, where one FP16 operation is counted as 0.5 FP32 operations\\n(2) Average Energy consumption of driving system (Ene-D). We record the power consumption per 100 kilometers (km) brought by the driving system of the autonomous vehicle. It is influenced by many factors, such as vehicle speed and acceleration, and we obtain it by the SUMO platform following the previous method [ 35 ] .\\n(3) Average Driving range (DR). We record the driving range (km) of the autonomous vehicle per kwh, considering only the energy consumption of the perception system and driving system.\\nThen, we design four metrics, following the previous work [ 66 , 32 ] , to evaluate the driving performance (i.e., safety, efficiency, comfort, and impact) of the autonomous vehicle, as follows:\\n(1)\\nPercentage of time-to-collision values with potential collision risks (TTC-R). We record the time-to-collision values of the autonomous vehicle and count the percentage of TTCs less than 4 seconds that are regarded as having potential collision risk following the previous work [ 66 ] . A smaller TTC-R indicates that the autonomous vehicle is safer.\\n(2)\\nAverage velocity (VEL).\\nWe record the average velocity of the autonomous vehicle. A larger VEL indicates higher traffic efficiency.\\n(3)\\nAverage acceleration change (AC).\\nWe record the average acceleration change of the autonomous vehicle. A smaller AC indicates a more comfortable driving experience.\\n(4)\\nAverage deceleration (DEC). After the autonomous vehicle performs abrupt braking or lane-changing behaviors, we record the deceleration of the rear vehicle.\\nA smaller DEC means that the autonomous vehicle has less impact on the rear vehicle.\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we present these metrics under different traffic densities (i.e., low: < 10 \\u200b v \\u200b e \\u200b h / k \\u200b m / l \\u200b n <10veh/km/ln , medium: 10 − 30 \\u200b v \\u200b e \\u200b h / k \\u200b m / l \\u200b n 10-30veh/km/ln , and high: > 30 \\u200b v \\u200b e \\u200b h / k \\u200b m / l \\u200b n >30veh/km/ln ).\\nFirstly, we report the metrics of energy consumption in Figure 5 , 6 , and 7 . For power consumption of the perception system in Figure 5 , we can see that our framework EneAD achieves the smallest Ene-P, demonstrating that EneAD can achieve the lowest perception consumption. Among these baselines, the Auto method has the largest Ene-P since it does not consider reducing the perception consumption. In addition, although the model compression methods Sparse, Quantize, Distill, and EcoFusion can achieve a smaller Ene-P than Auto, they also have larger Ene-P values than our framework since they do not consider adjusting the framerate at which perception models run.\\nAfterward, in Figure 6 we can see that our framework EneAD has the smallest Ene-D, which demonstrates that EneAD can also lower the power consumption of the driving system. This is because our robust decision module can generate relatively conservative driving behaviors with smoother velocity changes.\\nThe poor performance of Sparse, Quantize, Distill, and EcoFusion is attributed to their inferior perception accuracies in challenging traffic scenarios, leading to more sudden speed changes that can increase power consumption.\\nFinally, we show the driving range metric DR in Figure 7 . Since EneAD has the lowest power consumption of both the perception and driving system, it can achieve the largest driving range per kwh.\\nTo sum up, our framework EneAD can achieve a 1.9 × − 3.5 × 1.9\\\\times-3.5\\\\times reduction of perception consumption, a slight reduction of the driving system, and a 3.9 % − 8.5 % 3.9\\\\%-8.5\\\\% increase of driving range.\\nSecondly, we report the metrics in Figure 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 . None of the methods cause any collision in the test phase. For safety in Figure 8 , we observe that our framework EneAD has a TTC-R as small as the one achieved by Auto with the highest computational consumption. In addition, a smaller VEL in Figure 9 indicates that EneAD has a slight decrease compared to Auto in driving efficiency, and the smallest AC and DEC in Figure 10 and 11 indicate that EneAD can improve comfort and reduce disturbance to traffic flow. This is due to our robust decision module, which includes a regularization term to constrain the Q function updates in the presence of perturbed state features. It can avoid overestimating the Q values of aggressive driving actions, making the autonomous vehicle drive more smoothly.\\nThe poor performance of Sparse, Quantize, Distill, and EcoFusion is caused by their unstable difficulty levels of the perception results and the lack of constraints on the Q function updates.\\nTo sum up, although our framework EneAD can achieve a substantial decrease in computational consumption, EneAD can still maintain high safety as Auto and achieve the best performance in comfort and impact, with a slight decrease in traffic efficiency.\\nOverall, the above results indicate that our framework yields substantial energy savings across all traffic densities while preserving strong driving performance.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'The adaptive perception module is used to reduce the energy consumption of perception computing. To achieve this, we first propose a classification model to distinguish perception difficulty levels of different traffic scenarios and then design a transferable tuning paradigm to explore energy-efficient knob configurations under different accuracy requirements.\\nEvaluation of Scenario Classification Model. Firstly, our classification model is based on the image encoder Swin-T [ 44 ] , which is a hierarchical transformer that combines local attention with shifted windows. To evidence its effectiveness and efficiency in our task, we compare it with the following image encoders: (1) ViT [ 43 ] . Vision transformer that leverages global attention for superior context understanding on image patches. (2) MobileNet [ 67 ] . Lightweight convolution network that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce computation. (3) ResNet50 [ 68 ] . Convolution network that introduces residual connections for deep networks.\\nThen, we design two metrics as follows: (1) Ene-Q. Average power consumption of scenario classification, which is calculated in the same way as Ene-P of the perception system. (2) Accuracy. The percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances.\\nWe report these metrics of our method and the baselines in Table II . As shown, ViT has the highest accuracy but requires a very large computational consumption. MobileNet is the most lightweight model but has a significant drop in accuracy. ResNet50 and our method with Swin-T have nearly the same computational consumption, but the accuracy of our method is much higher than the one of ResNet50. Overall, our method achieves the best balance between computational consumption and accuracy for scenario difficulty classification.\\nBesides a classification result, we also output an uncertainty value by adopting Monte Carlo dropout in the classification head. When the uncertainty value of a classification result is greater than 0.02, we regard this result as ”uncertain” and adjust it to the highest difficulty level.\\nIn Table I , we present the percentage of overestimated, underestimated, and correct classification results among the uncertain results. As shown, 35.6% of the uncertain results are overestimated, 52.1% are underestimated, and 12.3% are correct. Therefore, our uncertainty estimation operation is effective in finding uncertain classification results.\\nEvaluation of Knob Tuning Method. To explore promising configurations, we use Bayesian optimization as the tuning paradigm and propose a meta-surrogate model to transfer tuning knowledge between different tuning instances.\\nTo evaluate the tuning performance, we compared it with two tuning methods and a variant of our method as follows:\\n(1) Heuristic [ 69 ] . A greedy local search method that searches from multiple random configurations and evaluates neighboring configurations to find a better one.\\n(2) RL-based [ 70 ] . A reinforcement learning-based tuning method that uses neural networks to approximate the configuration-accuracy relationship and select the next configuration to evaluate.\\n(3) w/o-meta. A variant that removes the meta-surrogate model. Instead, it starts tuning from scratch using an initial surrogate model. To evaluate their tuning performance, we record the normalized computational consumption (named Normalized C-C) of the current optimal configurations under multiple accuracy requirements (detailed in Section IV-D ) and average them.\\nIn Figure 13 , we plot the tuning curves of Heuristic, RL-based, w/o-meta within 60 tuning iterations. All methods start tuning from scratch. As shown, w/o-meta reaches the optimal value fastest compared to Heuristic and RL-based, demonstrating the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization in our tuning task. In addition, to evidence the effectiveness of our meta-surrogate model, we compare the tuning performance of w/o-meta and our complete method in Figure 13 . Their tuning curves are based on the second tuning instance. In this study, there are k k tuning instances corresponding to k k difficulty levels. If using our complete method with the meta-surrogate model, the second instance can transfer tuning knowledge from the first instance. As shown, our complete method can reach the optimal value after 25 tuning iterations, fewer than the 40 iterations of w/o-meta, proving that the meta-surrogate model is effective in transferring tuning knowledge and thus speeds up the tuning process.\\nEffect of Accuracy Requirements. Our knob tuning model can search for promising configurations under multiple accuracy requirements, i.e., 𝒜 i , i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 \\\\mathcal{A}_{i},\\\\ i=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 , with a NDS value of 0.69, 0.70, 0.71, 0.72, 0.73, 0.74, 0.75, 0.76, respectively. After the tuning converges, we retrieve the final configuration settings in the configuration dictionary and present their computational consumption of the perception system (Ene-P) and the driving system (Ene-D), and safety metric (TTC-R) in Figure 14 . As shown, a lower accuracy requirement results in lower computational consumption of the perception system, while the consumption of the driving system increases and the safety deteriorates. Specifically, the high accuracies 𝒜 7 \\\\mathcal{A}_{7} and 𝒜 8 \\\\mathcal{A}_{8} significantly increase perception computation but offer limited optimization for other metrics. The low accuracies 𝒜 1 − 𝒜 4 \\\\mathcal{A}_{1}-\\\\mathcal{A}_{4} drastically reduce the stability and safety of autonomous driving, while 𝒜 5 \\\\mathcal{A}_{5} and 𝒜 6 \\\\mathcal{A}_{6} can achieve a well-balanced performance across all metrics.\\nUnless otherwise specified, the results in other experiments are based on the accuracy requirement 𝒜 6 = 0.74 \\\\mathcal{A}_{6}=0.74 .\\nConfiguration Setting at Different Difficulty Levels. In Table III , we present the knob values of configurations in different perception difficulty levels after tuning. In this study, we set four levels (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4), and a higher difficulty level corresponding to a more challenging traffic scenario (e.g., adverse weather conditions).\\nAs shown in the table, for high difficulty levels, knob values with high computation are required to achieve a desired accuracy as much as possible. Conversely, for low difficulty levels, knob values with low computation are sufficient to meet the accuracy requirement.\\nIn addition, we find that only scenarios with levels 1, 2, and 3 have reduced configurations, while scenarios with level 4 still maintain the highest-computation configuration. This is because even with the highest-computation configuration, these scenarios still only achieve an accuracy of 0.72, failing to meet our accuracy requirement of 0.74.\\nTo address it, more research breakthroughs in autonomous driving perception models are needed in the future.\\nEvaluation of Configuration Switching. In our experiments, the system switches configurations an average of 2.3 times per kilometer. However, in real-world driving scenarios, this frequency is expected to be lower, since real environments typically feature larger, more continuous scenes (e.g., long highways or urban blocks) and fewer abrupt transitions.\\nSince all models are resident in memory, switching between them incurs negligible latency, enabling adaptive perception with seamless model transitions.',\n",

Deep deterministic policy gradient method that collapses the parameterized action structure into a continuous one.\\n(2) P-DQN [ 58 ] . Parameterized deep Q-learning method that directly learns the parameterized action structure,\\n(3) RP-DQN [ 29 ] .

As shown, our method has the lowest TTC-R, AC, and DEC, demonstrating it achieves the best performance in safety, comfort, and impact compared to other methods. However, the VEL of our method has a slight decrease compared to RBP-DQN. The results indicate that our reinforcement learning can make the autonomous vehicle more cautious when facing perturbed state features, leading to larger distances from other vehicles and smoother velocity changes. The performance of RBP-DQN arises from the lack of regularization in updating Q values, leading to the misestimation of Q values of some aggressive driving actions. In addition, the poor performance of P-DDPG and P-DQN is because their model architectures struggle to optimize the action policy stably.',\n",

However, these benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on large-scale deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification, quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However, these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework, called EneAD, which includes an adaptive perception and a robust decision module. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning. Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Event logs have become one of the most valuable assets of modern enterprises, capturing rich traces of user behavior and system operations across large-scale services. These logs are massive—often spanning terabytes per day—and exhibit highly heterogeneous and temporal structures. Unlike standard tabular data, where each record is typically treated as an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) instance, event logs encode sequential dependencies and contextual relationships across time. This intrinsic complexity makes them substantially more challenging to analyze, yet also more informative. Each record may involve multiple dimensions with distinct semantics, cardinalities, and data types. For instance, in mobile gaming, a player’s log may contain timestamps, categorical attributes, integer-valued statistics (e.g., kills), and continuous metrics (e.g., kill–death ratios). In contrast, e-commerce platforms record user click histories, campaign identifiers, and detailed product attributes. Such diversity and scale make event logs both highly informative and extremely challenging to analyze.\\nExtracting meaningful knowledge from these logs relies heavily on feature engineering, where data scientists manually design informative variables guided by domain expertise and business understanding [ 1 ] . This process involves extensive data exploration, reasoning about domain logic, hypothesis formulation, and iterative experimentation—often consuming days or weeks of effort even for experienced practitioners. The challenge becomes even more severe in industrial environments serving millions of users, where the sheer data volume and heterogeneity amplify the cost and complexity. As a result, there is a long-standing demand for technologies that can automate this process, leading to the field of Automated Feature Engineering (AutoFE).\\nExisting AutoFE research spans diverse directions, including AutoML [ 2 ] , genetic algorithms (GA) [ 3 , 4 ] , and reinforcement learning (RL) [ 5 , 6 ] . These methods aim to replace the manual trial-and-error cycle with self-improvement mechanisms. However, their lack of explainability and generality has significantly hindered industrial adoption. Recently, the emergence of large language model (LLM)–based agents has opened a promising new direction that unifies automation with human-like reasoning and interpretability. LLMs possess broad prior knowledge across domains, strong coding abilities comparable to human engineers, and the capacity to perform structured reasoning within complex contexts. They have demonstrated potential in data-centric tasks such as scientific discovery [ 7 , 8 ] , mathematical problem solving [ 9 ] , and symbolic regression [ 10 ] . Nonetheless, current applications of LLMs to feature engineering remain limited to simple tabular data [ 11 , 12 ] , leaving the challenge of building robust and general systems for real-world industrial scenarios largely unresolved.\\nTo bridge this gap, we present a multi-agent collaborative system that automatically extracts novel and insightful features from large-scale industrial event log data. Our system is designed to address the following key challenges:\\nData complexity. Event log data exhibit rich temporal dependencies and heterogeneous structures that differ fundamentally from standard tabular data. Many logs also encode implicit relational patterns. For example, in mobile games, players sharing the same TeamID form a teammate network critical for retention analysis; in social applications, comment logs form dynamic interaction graphs; and in e-commerce platforms, user–item activities naturally form bipartite graphs. A robust solution must therefore exploit both temporal and relational structure when constructing features. Furthermore, real-world event logs often include attributes stored in diverse formats (e.g., lists, JSON strings, or embedded URLs), requiring extensive preprocessing before feature extraction. Even expert data scientists spend substantial effort resolving such heterogeneity, and transferring expertise across domains (e.g., from gaming to e-commerce) demands considerable relearning. These factors collectively constrain the scalability and generalizability of traditional automatic feature engineering methods.\\nExplainability. Beyond managing complexity, ensuring feature explainability is essential for both scientific rigor and industrial deployment. Diverse stakeholders—including data engineers, domain experts, and decision makers—must be able to interpret the semantics and rationale of generated features. This requires not only feature-level transparency (i.e., understanding what a feature represents) but also process-level transparency (i.e., how it was derived). In practice, the most valuable features often capture deep relationships between data structure, semantics, and business logic. Without a clear mechanism to encode and communicate such reasoning, automated feature engineering risks producing trivial or misleading results. Moreover, given the structural and semantic complexity of industrial logs, explainability becomes crucial for tracing, validating, and refining the feature derivation process.\\nSelf-evolution. The high dimensionality and combinatorial nature of event log data create an enormous feature search space, which poses a fundamental challenge for traditional automated methods. Classical approaches typically rely on predefined transformation operators and heuristic search strategies, yet the vast combination space makes it difficult to identify promising exploration directions. Reinforcement- or evolution-based frameworks further suffer from sparse or delayed reward signals relative to the size of the search space, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal feature discovery. Addressing this challenge requires a mechanism that integrates evaluation feedback with knowledge distilled from historical trajectories, allowing the search process to leverage past experience and avoid inefficient wandering in the immense feature space.\\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a comprehensive multi-agent collaborative system for automatic feature extraction from industrial event log data, termed Feature Engineering LLM Agents (FELA) . FELA autonomously discovers novel and high-performing features through an insight-guided self-evolution paradigm. Beyond constructing an agent workflow that merely generates feature engineering code, FELA tackles a more fundamental question: How can ideas be systematically and controllably evolved with prior knowledge?\\nThe system is designed around three key components that collectively enable effective feature discovery on complex, large-scale datasets.\\nMulti-agent collaborative architecture. FELA employs multiple LLM-based agents with specialized roles that collaborate to manage the complexity of automated feature engineering. Leveraging the reasoning capabilities and domain priors of large language models, idea agents autonomously generate novel feature hypotheses grounded in dataset semantics. Code agents then translate these ideas into executable feature extraction code, enabling expressiveness beyond fixed operation sets used in traditional approaches. Since LLMs are prone to hallucination [ 13 , 14 ] , particularly in high-dimensional and complex domains, FELA introduces critic agents to evaluate and verify outputs from both idea and code agents. This decoupled design separates creativity from verification, effectively mitigating hallucination and improving the reliability of generated features.\\nExplainable and steerable knowledge structure. FELA organizes knowledge in a hierarchical form consisting of ideas and their corresponding derived features , as illustrated in Figure 1 . Ideas encapsulate high-level, human-readable insights, while features represents their logical and mathematical realizations. This design draws inspiration from cognitive science studies [ 15 , 16 ] , which suggest that human reasoning proceeds top-down—from abstract concepts to more concrete understandings. Unlike existing methods [ 12 , 11 ] , this structure yields a transparent and steerable evolution trajectory, allowing users to control exploration depth and conceptual scope. Moreover, the modular organization facilitates scalability and continual improvement, as new ideas—whether derived from experts or external knowledge sources—can be seamlessly integrated into the system’s knowledge base, enabling ongoing human–machine co-evolution.\\nAgentic evolution algorithm. We further propose an adaptive learning algorithm that integrates the strengths of genetic algorithms and non-associative reinforcement learning. Idea and feature evolution follows an island-based population paradigm, while a multi-armed bandit mechanism with Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) exploration dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across idea trajectories. To enhance learning efficiency, we employ an evaluation agent to summarize experience from past trials and adaptively update the shared system memory. FELA maintains a dual-memory design: short-term memory captures local context for planning and adaptation, whereas long-term memory supports cross-trajectory knowledge transfer. This design allows the system to leverage both evaluation feedback and accumulated historical experience, preventing inefficient wandering in the feature search space.\\nThrough these designs, FELA makes the following key academic contributions:\\nTo the best of our knowledge, FELA is the first agentic system capable of performing automated feature engineering on industrial-scale event log data .\\nWe introduce a novel hybrid evolution framework that combines genetic and reinforcement learning principles within a hierarchical knowledge structure, enabling efficient and interpretable idea evolution.\\nExtensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalizability of our approach.\\nWe have deployed FELA in our internal feature engineering platform, saving weeks of labor on manual feature engineering and improving performances of various predictive models across multiple business scenarios.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Feature engineering—also referred to as feature transformation or feature generation—denotes the process of constructing, transforming, and selecting informative variables from raw data to enhance the performance and generalization of machine learning models [ 17 ] . By providing models with the most relevant representations, effective feature engineering underpins predictive accuracy, interpretability, and decision-making capability.\\nBroadly, existing approaches to feature generation fall into two paradigms. The first, latent representation learning , leverages deep architectures such as deep factorization machines and neural representation models to capture complex, nonlinear dependencies in data [ 18 , 19 ] . While powerful, these approaches often lack interpretability and traceability [ 20 ] . The second paradigm, explicit feature transformation , constructs new features through rule-based arithmetic, aggregation, or logical operations [ 21 , 22 ] . These methods depend heavily on domain expertise and manual design, which limits their scalability and adaptability across tasks.\\nIn industrial environments, raw data streams exhibit complexities far beyond those of conventional structured or tabular datasets, posing substantially greater challenges for feature engineering. The characteristics of industrial data are often summarized by the “5Vs” framework— Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity , and Value [ 23 ] . Industrial systems typically involve intricate structural dependencies and operational uncertainties, further complicating the extraction of robust and meaningful features. Consequently, there is a growing demand for automated, domain-adaptive feature engineering techniques that can handle heterogeneous, large-scale, and often unstructured data [ 24 ] .\\nManual feature engineering, by contrast, is increasingly impractical in such settings. It relies heavily on the tacit domain knowledge of data scientists, who face steep learning curves when interpreting complex raw data. Frequent project transitions further exacerbate the problem, as practitioners must repeatedly invest substantial effort to understand new datasets and devise feature hypotheses from scratch—significantly impairing productivity and slowing innovation.\\nTo mitigate these limitations, recent work has focused on automated feature engineering (AutoFE) . Traditional AutoFE methods include tree-based exploration [ 25 ] , iterative subsampling [ 26 ] , and transformation enumeration [ 27 ] . Learning-based approaches further exploit machine learning and reinforcement learning to guide the feature construction process [ 21 , 28 , 29 ] . For example, OpenFE [ 30 ] integrates a feature-boosting algorithm with a two-stage pruning mechanism to achieve expert-level performance. Despite these advances, most existing AutoFE systems struggle to integrate domain expertise and constrained by the predefined operation sets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in this direction, offering contextual reasoning and domain-aware knowledge transfer for feature discovery [ 17 ] .\\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to leverage pre-trained knowledge for novel tasks through techniques such as prompt engineering and in-context learning, often without additional task-specific training [ 31 , 32 ] .

       "      'paragraphs': 'Feature engineering—also referred to as feature transformation or feature generation—denotes the process of constructing, transforming, and selecting informative variables from raw data to enhance the performance and generalization of machine learning models [ 17 ] . By providing models with the most relevant representations, effective feature engineering underpins predictive accuracy, interpretability, and decision-making capability.\\nBroadly, existing approaches to feature generation fall into two paradigms. The first, latent representation learning , leverages deep architectures such as deep factorization machines and neural representation models to capture complex, nonlinear dependencies in data [ 18 , 19 ] . While powerful, these approaches often lack interpretability and traceability [ 20 ] . The second paradigm, explicit feature transformation , constructs new features through rule-based arithmetic, aggregation, or logical operations [ 21 , 22 ] . These methods depend heavily on domain expertise and manual design, which limits their scalability and adaptability across tasks.\\nIn industrial environments, raw data streams exhibit complexities far beyond those of conventional structured or tabular datasets, posing substantially greater challenges for feature engineering. The characteristics of industrial data are often summarized by the “5Vs” framework— Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity , and Value [ 23 ] . Industrial systems typically involve intricate structural dependencies and operational uncertainties, further complicating the extraction of robust and meaningful features. Consequently, there is a growing demand for automated, domain-adaptive feature engineering techniques that can handle heterogeneous, large-scale, and often unstructured data [ 24 ] .\\nManual feature engineering, by contrast, is increasingly impractical in such settings. It relies heavily on the tacit domain knowledge of data scientists, who face steep learning curves when interpreting complex raw data. Frequent project transitions further exacerbate the problem, as practitioners must repeatedly invest substantial effort to understand new datasets and devise feature hypotheses from scratch—significantly impairing productivity and slowing innovation.\\nTo mitigate these limitations, recent work has focused on automated feature engineering (AutoFE) . Traditional AutoFE methods include tree-based exploration [ 25 ] , iterative subsampling [ 26 ] , and transformation enumeration [ 27 ] . Learning-based approaches further exploit machine learning and reinforcement learning to guide the feature construction process [ 21 , 28 , 29 ] . For example, OpenFE [ 30 ] integrates a feature-boosting algorithm with a two-stage pruning mechanism to achieve expert-level performance. Despite these advances, most existing AutoFE systems struggle to integrate domain expertise and constrained by the predefined operation sets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in this direction, offering contextual reasoning and domain-aware knowledge transfer for feature discovery [ 17 ] .',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Figure 2 illustrates the overall architecture of FELA , which consists of two major components: (1) external dependencies, including the data schema, prior knowledge, and log data 1 1 1 Without loss of generality, we use log data in the following discussion. However, our system can be easily applied to simpler tabular datasets. ; and (2) the internal agent workspace.\\nExternal Dependencies. The data schema ℋ \\\\mathcal{H} provides metadata describing the dataset, such as the context of data collection, column types, and textual descriptions. This information grounds the reasoning process and mitigates potential hallucinations by offering sufficient contextual grounding for large language model (LLM) agents. The prior knowledge component captures textual insights gathered from domain experts, stakeholder interviews, or external web resources. These insights are stored in a knowledge base to guide the system’s initial exploration. Although FELA can operate without explicit prior knowledge, such injections enable stronger control over the search space and alignment with domain-specific objectives. Finally, the event log data serves as the operational environment and provides the material basis for generating experimental results and evaluating newly proposed features.\\nInternal Agent Workspace. Within the agent workspace, FELA employs a team-based agent framework that iteratively generates, critiques, implements, and evaluates new feature ideas. The idea agents consider the data schema, current knowledge base, and past experience to propose plausible new features. Each proposal is subsequently reviewed by an idea critic , which evaluates its novelty, soundness, and adherence to predefined quality criteria. Approved ideas are then passed to the code agents , which translate high-level feature concepts into executable feature engineering code. The generated code is validated by a code critic to ensure syntactic correctness and logical consistency before being added to the code repository.\\nThe approved code is executed to transform the raw feature space, and the resulting features are used in downstream model training and evaluation under the target performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC-score). The evaluation results are then processed by an evaluate agent , responsible for two key functions: (1) updating the performance attributes of the evaluated idea and corresponding feature implementations (2) synthesizing higher-level experience abstraction as global long-term memory. The updated knowledge base and memory modules subsequently inform the next round of idea generation, enabling FELA to perform self-improving, closed-loop evolution in feature engineering.\\nIn the following sections, we detail the agent interaction protocol, the reward formulation for idea evaluation, and the mechanisms enabling FELA’s long-term evolution and knowledge retention.\\nThe knowledge base serves as the central repository of textual insights and their corresponding feature implementations. Formally, it is defined as 𝒦 = { I i } i = 1 N I \\\\mathcal{K}=\\\\{I_{i}\\\\}_{i=1}^{N_{I}} , where each idea I i I_{i} represents an abstract understanding of the underlying data scenario. For example, in an e-commerce advertising context, an insight might be expressed as “Users tend to purchase complementary items within the same session.” Although such an idea does not directly specify how to compute a feature, it encapsulates a meaningful intuition—analogous to how human data scientists begin their exploratory reasoning in practice.\\nEach idea I i I_{i} is associated with one or more features d i \\u200b j {d_{ij}} , which provide concrete realizations of how the insight can be operationalized logically and mathematically. In the above example, “complementary items” can be interpreted in multiple ways—such as categorical complementarity (e.g., “iPhone” and “iPhone case”) or temporal complementarity (e.g., “diapers” and “beer” purchased sequentially). These distinct interpretations correspond to different features of the same high-level insight. Together, the ideas and their features form a two-layer hierarchical structure, as illustrated in Figure 3 , representing the conceptual-to-operational flow of feature construction. Formally, the two-layer hierarchical knowledge base 𝒦 \\\\mathcal{K} can be expressed as\\nwhere M i M_{i} denotes the number of features in i i th idea. Drawing an analogy to island-based genetic algorithms, each idea can be viewed as an “island,” while its associated features constitute the “population” of that island. Features within the same island may undergo mutation to explore local variations, while different islands can interact and exchange information to generate novel ideas—a process that will be elaborated in the following section.\\nOperating in the hypothetical space, the role of idea agents is to expand the knowledge base and drive its evolution. At each iteration step t t , an idea agent takes as input the current knowledge database 𝒦 t \\\\mathcal{K}_{t} and selects one of the following actions: (1) generate a new feature from an existing insight, (2) synthesize a new insight from existing insights, or (3) create an entirely new idea. Each action is carried out by a specialized sub-agent.\\nFeature Proposer. When option (1) is chosen, we employ an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm to sample an idea for exploitation and generate a new feature. The details of UCB algorithm are provided in Sec. IV-H . For a given idea, we retrieve its associated past experiences to construct the short-term memory for that idea. Based on this memory ℳ s \\\\mathcal{M}_{s} and the adaptively improved global long-term memory ℳ l \\\\mathcal{M}_{l} , the LLM-based agent proposes a new feature implementation that is (i) consistent with the abstract insight, (ii) technically sound, and (iii) creative—i.e., distinct from existing implementations under the same idea. Formally,\\nThe feature implementation d d is represented as a tuple ( reason , summary , pseudocode ) (\\\\text{reason},\\\\text{summary},\\\\text{pseudocode}) . The reason field allows the idea agent to explicitly articulate the rationale behind proposing a specific implementation. The summary provides a concise description of the feature’s underlying intuition. The pseudocode encodes the programmable instructions for the downstream code agent, including all necessary dependencies to generate the targeted feature. Collectively, this tuple establishes a seamless pathway from high-level abstract insight to detailed, implementable instructions. We find that such a structured representation is critical for ensuring robustness and consistency in the subsequent code generation process.\\nTo ensure that the generated feature implementations satisfy these criteria, we adopt the reasoning spirit of ReAct [ 49 ] and Reflexion [ 50 ] , and employ a three-step reasoning framework (see Figure 4 ) for our agents. Specifically, the first step, analyze , gathers all relevant information, examines the current state, and produces a textual analysis trace. This step encourages the LLM to form a deep understanding of the provided context. The second step, self-reflect , serves as a self-critique phase, prompting the model to check for factual errors or inconsistencies against the task requirements. The final step, reconstruct , allows the LLM to revise its prior reasoning based on the self-reflection results, thereby fostering deeper understanding and improved reasoning before producing the final output .\\nIdea Synthesizer. When option (2) is selected, the LLM is instructed to synthesize new ideas by combining existing ones, guided by the current ideas and their associated evaluation scores. This process mimics how humans interconnect related concepts to generate novel insights. While prior work typically selects which ideas (e.g., two) may be combined, we observe that LLMs are inherently capable reasoners that can exploit contextual cues to form meaningful combinations—thanks to the strong priors embedded in their parameters. Therefore, we provide the model with all existing ideas in the knowledge base 𝒦 \\\\mathcal{K} (including newly generated ones) and instruct it to propose a new idea satisfying three criteria: novelty, soundness, and consistency. Formally,\\nDuring the analysis phase, the LLM is explicitly required to ground its innovation in existing ideas, which, according to our observations, effectively reduces hallucination.\\nIdea Creator. The idea creator is responsible for generating entirely new ideas that expand the knowledge base beyond previously injected prior knowledge. Taking the entire knowledge base 𝒦 \\\\mathcal{K} as input, and leveraging the LLM’s strong reasoning and abstraction capabilities, the idea creator can propose novel, logically sound, and schema-consistent ideas that have not been represented before. This capability stems from the extensive corpus used during LLM pre-training, which implicitly encodes a vast reservoir of latent knowledge across diverse domains. By systematically eliciting this embedded intelligence and encouraging creative reasoning, the idea creator continuously enriches the knowledge base with valuable new insights. 2 2 2 In fact, we can even enroll the updated knowledge from internet such as WebAgent [ 51 ] . However, to maintain controlled experiments, our experiment setup restricts agents to offline operation. Formally,\\nThe role of the code agent is to faithfully translate the feature implementation pseudocode and associated analysis into executable feature engineering code. Given a feature implementation produced by the idea agent, along with high-quality examples from previous attempts and the data schema as concrete guidance, the code agent generates highly executable and arbitrarily sophisticated code θ t \\\\theta_{t} to transform raw features:\\nwhere { { d i , j } j = 0 M i } i = 0 k \\\\{\\\\{d_{i,j}\\\\}_{j=0}^{M_{i}}\\\\}_{i=0}^{k} denotes selected feature implementations from k k ideas, and t t denotes the iteration step in the FELA system.\\nCompared to existing LLM-based approaches, our solution emphasizes two key improvements. First, instead of relying on a predefined feature operation set as in [ 11 , 52 ] , we allow the LLM to code freely. While operation sets provide high controllability, they are extremely limited and inefficient for two reasons: (i) many feature computations cannot be represented by simple binary operations (e.g., k-means clustering), and complex features often require multiple rounds of refinement; (ii) exhaustively enumerating all possible arithmetic operations is practically infeasible, which imposes an upper bound on the expressiveness of feature engineering.\\nSecond, unlike prior free-coding approaches [ 12 ] , which often produce inconsistent results and degrade in quality as context length increases over iterations, our method grounds code generation on the underlying ideas and feature implementations. These implementations provide precisely the right context to guide the LLM coder, ensuring robust and steerable growth of feature engineering code. This design enables FELA to generate dozens of new features spanning thousands of lines of code, while maintaining consistency, correctness, and interpretability.\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from attention distillation issues [ 53 , 54 ] when dealing with long contexts, making them prone to hallucinations and reasoning failures. This challenge is particularly severe in our setting, where both ideas and their implementations evolve into large and complex structures over time. In such cases, idea agents and code agents may deviate from intended instructions or produce low-quality results.\\nTo address this problem, we introduce two auxiliary agents— idea critics and code critics —which follow a unified design philosophy. Given the output from an idea agent (or code agent), a critic agent is responsible for rigorously evaluating whether the newly generated idea (or code) satisfies the requirements of consistency and correctness . Consistency refers to the alignment with the data schema and the existing knowledge base, while correctness ensures that the proposed idea or code is reasonable and technically sound.\\nIf any requirement is violated, the critic agent provides detailed feedback to the corresponding generator (idea or code agent), allowing it to revise and improve its output before proceeding. The incorporation of these critics is crucial for maintaining the robustness and reliability of a multi-agent system operating over extended periods—an essential property for real-world industrial applications.\\nFormally, the critic’s operation can be represented as:\\nwhere 𝒵 t \\\\mathcal{Z}_{t} denotes the critic feedback and C C represents the set of evaluation criteria. Consequently, the update equation for the code agent (Eq. 8 ) becomes:\\nIn practice, we define a maximum number of critic iterations Z Z . When z > Z z>Z , the system forfeits the current refinement loop and initiates a new round of exploration. Similar critic feedbacks are applied to idea agents.\\nAfter each round of model training and testing, we obtain feedback signals (e.g., AUC scores) from the downstream prediction task. However, such feedback is extremely sparse relative to the vast—if not infinite—search space in our system, where ideas, implementations, and codes all require exploration and reward-driven updates. Traditional AutoML systems often operate under either a limited search space or a setting where Monte Carlo sampling of candidate actions is computationally cheap. In contrast, in our LLM-based framework, each action (e.g., generating a new idea or implementation) is both computationally and semantically expensive.\\nTo overcome this challenge, we leverage the intrinsic reasoning capability of LLMs to perform an additional step of reflective analysis after receiving reward feedback. The evaluation agent interprets the reward signal and produces an informative summary of the current exploration trajectory and its corresponding outcomes. This process effectively increases the bandwidth of the reward channel , enabling more targeted and precise search in subsequent iterations.\\nAll such analyses are persistently maintained through our long–short term memory system, which captures both local (short-term) contextual feedback and global (long-term) strategic insights. The details of this memory mechanism are discussed in the following section. Formally, we have\\nThe memory system in FELA is designed to harness past evolutionary experiences to guide future exploration effectively. It comprises two distinct components: a long-term collaborative memory and a short-term feature-based memory.\\nThe long-term memory (see Figure 5 ), denoted as ℳ l \\\\mathcal{M}_{l} , captures high-level, natural language expolation insights that are shared across the entire knowledge base. Following each exploration cycle, a dedicated long-term memory agent progressively updates ℳ l \\\\mathcal{M}_{l} by incorporating the current state of the evolving idea and its associated rewards. This refreshed long-term memory is then utilized to inform the idea-generation process in the subsequent exploration round.\\nThe short-term memory (see Figure 6 ), denoted as ℳ s \\\\mathcal{M}_{s} , provides specific, actionable suggestions for augmenting the current idea with new features, which operates in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) manner. To generate ℳ s \\\\mathcal{M}_{s} , the system first retrieves a set of ideas semantically related to the current one. This is achieved by embedding each idea’s insight and feature set into a vector space, where the top- K K most similar ideas are retrieved based on cosine similarity. Then, the current idea and its retrieved neighbors are processed by an LLM to produce the short-term memory ℳ s \\\\mathcal{M}_{s} . This output is fed into the idea agent, which leverages the positive and negative features from related ideas to make more informed and effective modifications, thereby steering the evolutionary process more efficiently.\\nFELA introduces a novel evolutionary learning algorithm that integrates RL and GA to enhance feature evolution efficiency. To quantify the utility of a newly generated feature d i , j + 1 d_{i,j+1} within idea I i I_{i} , we define a relative score s \\u200b ( d i , j + 1 ) s(d_{i,j+1}) as\\nwhere θ i , j \\\\theta_{i,j} and θ i , j + 1 \\\\theta_{i,j+1} denote the feature transformation functions applied to the feature sets { d i , j ′ } j ′ = 1 j \\\\{d_{i,j^{\\\\prime}}\\\\}_{j^{\\\\prime}=1}^{j} and { d i , j ′ } j ′ = 1 j + 1 \\\\{d_{i,j^{\\\\prime}}\\\\}_{j^{\\\\prime}=1}^{j+1} , respectively. This score directly measures the additional contribution of d i , j + 1 d_{i,j+1} to the predictive performance of I i I_{i} . A positive s \\u200b ( d i , j + 1 ) s(d_{i,j+1}) indicates a beneficial feature, which is retained for subsequent code generation; conversely, a negative score leads to the feature being recorded as a negative sample for the idea. To balance exploration and exploitation during evolution, FELA employs the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) criterion to select the idea for the next evolution round. The UCB for idea I i I_{i} is defined as\\nwhere Q i Q_{i} is the visit count of I i I_{i} , Q Q is the total visits across all ideas, and c c is a hyperparameter controlling exploration. The idea with the highest UCB is selected for further evolution, effectively balancing the exploration of new feature combinations and the exploitation of high-performing ideas.',\n",

The updated knowledge base and memory modules subsequently inform the next round of idea generation, enabling FELA to perform self-improving, closed-loop evolution in feature engineering.\\nIn the following sections, we detail the agent interaction protocol, the reward formulation for idea evaluation, and the mechanisms enabling FELA’s long-term evolution and knowledge retention.',\n",

For example, in an e-commerce advertising context, an insight might be expressed as “Users tend to purchase complementary items within the same session.” Although such an idea does not directly specify how to compute a feature, it encapsulates a meaningful intuition—analogous to how human data scientists begin their exploratory reasoning in practice.\\nEach idea I i I_{i} is associated with one or more features d i \\u200b j {d_{ij}} , which provide concrete realizations of how the insight can be operationalized logically and mathematically. In the above example, “complementary items” can be interpreted in multiple ways—such as categorical complementarity (e.g., “iPhone” and “iPhone case”) or temporal complementarity (e.g., “diapers” and “beer” purchased sequentially). These distinct interpretations correspond to different features of the same high-level insight. Together, the ideas and their features form a two-layer hierarchical structure, as illustrated in Figure 3 , representing the conceptual-to-operational flow of feature construction.

       "      'paragraphs': 'Operating in the hypothetical space, the role of idea agents is to expand the knowledge base and drive its evolution. At each iteration step t t , an idea agent takes as input the current knowledge database 𝒦 t \\\\mathcal{K}_{t} and selects one of the following actions: (1) generate a new feature from an existing insight, (2) synthesize a new insight from existing insights, or (3) create an entirely new idea. Each action is carried out by a specialized sub-agent.\\nFeature Proposer. When option (1) is chosen, we employ an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm to sample an idea for exploitation and generate a new feature. The details of UCB algorithm are provided in Sec. IV-H . For a given idea, we retrieve its associated past experiences to construct the short-term memory for that idea. Based on this memory ℳ s \\\\mathcal{M}_{s} and the adaptively improved global long-term memory ℳ l \\\\mathcal{M}_{l} , the LLM-based agent proposes a new feature implementation that is (i) consistent with the abstract insight, (ii) technically sound, and (iii) creative—i.e., distinct from existing implementations under the same idea. Formally,\\nThe feature implementation d d is represented as a tuple ( reason , summary , pseudocode ) (\\\\text{reason},\\\\text{summary},\\\\text{pseudocode}) . The reason field allows the idea agent to explicitly articulate the rationale behind proposing a specific implementation. The summary provides a concise description of the feature’s underlying intuition. The pseudocode encodes the programmable instructions for the downstream code agent, including all necessary dependencies to generate the targeted feature. Collectively, this tuple establishes a seamless pathway from high-level abstract insight to detailed, implementable instructions. We find that such a structured representation is critical for ensuring robustness and consistency in the subsequent code generation process.\\nTo ensure that the generated feature implementations satisfy these criteria, we adopt the reasoning spirit of ReAct [ 49 ] and Reflexion [ 50 ] , and employ a three-step reasoning framework (see Figure 4 ) for our agents. Specifically, the first step, analyze , gathers all relevant information, examines the current state, and produces a textual analysis trace. This step encourages the LLM to form a deep understanding of the provided context. The second step, self-reflect , serves as a self-critique phase, prompting the model to check for factual errors or inconsistencies against the task requirements. The final step, reconstruct , allows the LLM to revise its prior reasoning based on the self-reflection results, thereby fostering deeper understanding and improved reasoning before producing the final output .\\nIdea Synthesizer. When option (2) is selected, the LLM is instructed to synthesize new ideas by combining existing ones, guided by the current ideas and their associated evaluation scores. This process mimics how humans interconnect related concepts to generate novel insights. While prior work typically selects which ideas (e.g., two) may be combined, we observe that LLMs are inherently capable reasoners that can exploit contextual cues to form meaningful combinations—thanks to the strong priors embedded in their parameters. Therefore, we provide the model with all existing ideas in the knowledge base 𝒦 \\\\mathcal{K} (including newly generated ones) and instruct it to propose a new idea satisfying three criteria: novelty, soundness, and consistency. Formally,\\nDuring the analysis phase, the LLM is explicitly required to ground its innovation in existing ideas, which, according to our observations, effectively reduces hallucination.\\nIdea Creator. The idea creator is responsible for generating entirely new ideas that expand the knowledge base beyond previously injected prior knowledge. Taking the entire knowledge base 𝒦 \\\\mathcal{K} as input, and leveraging the LLM’s strong reasoning and abstraction capabilities, the idea creator can propose novel, logically sound, and schema-consistent ideas that have not been represented before. This capability stems from the extensive corpus used during LLM pre-training, which implicitly encodes a vast reservoir of latent knowledge across diverse domains. By systematically eliciting this embedded intelligence and encouraging creative reasoning, the idea creator continuously enriches the knowledge base with valuable new insights. 2 2 2 In fact, we can even enroll the updated knowledge from internet such as WebAgent [ 51 ] .

First, instead of relying on a predefined feature operation set as in [ 11 , 52 ] , we allow the LLM to code freely. While operation sets provide high controllability, they are extremely limited and inefficient for two reasons: (i) many feature computations cannot be represented by simple binary operations (e.g., k-means clustering), and complex features often require multiple rounds of refinement; (ii) exhaustively enumerating all possible arithmetic operations is practically infeasible, which imposes an upper bound on the expressiveness of feature engineering.\\nSecond, unlike prior free-coding approaches [ 12 ] , which often produce inconsistent results and degrade in quality as context length increases over iterations, our method grounds code generation on the underlying ideas and feature implementations. These implementations provide precisely the right context to guide the LLM coder, ensuring robust and steerable growth of feature engineering code. This design enables FELA to generate dozens of new features spanning thousands of lines of code, while maintaining consistency, correctness, and interpretability.',\n",

This challenge is particularly severe in our setting, where both ideas and their implementations evolve into large and complex structures over time. In such cases, idea agents and code agents may deviate from intended instructions or produce low-quality results.\\nTo address this problem, we introduce two auxiliary agents— idea critics and code critics —which follow a unified design philosophy. Given the output from an idea agent (or code agent), a critic agent is responsible for rigorously evaluating whether the newly generated idea (or code) satisfies the requirements of consistency and correctness . Consistency refers to the alignment with the data schema and the existing knowledge base, while correctness ensures that the proposed idea or code is reasonable and technically sound.\\nIf any requirement is violated, the critic agent provides detailed feedback to the corresponding generator (idea or code agent), allowing it to revise and improve its output before proceeding. The incorporation of these critics is crucial for maintaining the robustness and reliability of a multi-agent system operating over extended periods—an essential property for real-world industrial applications.\\nFormally, the critic’s operation can be represented as:\\nwhere 𝒵 t \\\\mathcal{Z}_{t} denotes the critic feedback and C C represents the set of evaluation criteria. Consequently, the update equation for the code agent (Eq. 8 ) becomes:\\nIn practice, we define a maximum number of critic iterations Z Z .

However, such feedback is extremely sparse relative to the vast—if not infinite—search space in our system, where ideas, implementations, and codes all require exploration and reward-driven updates. Traditional AutoML systems often operate under either a limited search space or a setting where Monte Carlo sampling of candidate actions is computationally cheap. In contrast, in our LLM-based framework, each action (e.g., generating a new idea or implementation) is both computationally and semantically expensive.\\nTo overcome this challenge, we leverage the intrinsic reasoning capability of LLMs to perform an additional step of reflective analysis after receiving reward feedback. The evaluation agent interprets the reward signal and produces an informative summary of the current exploration trajectory and its corresponding outcomes. This process effectively increases the bandwidth of the reward channel , enabling more targeted and precise search in subsequent iterations.\\nAll such analyses are persistently maintained through our long–short term memory system, which captures both local (short-term) contextual feedback and global (long-term) strategic insights.

The results collectively demonstrate that FELA establishes a new state-of-the-art agentic feature engineering.\\nIn the experiment, three real-world datasets are adopted for evaluation, including Diabetes Health Indicator Dataset (Dia) [ 55 ] , Tabao Conversion Prediction Data (Taobao) [ 56 ] , and the User Churn Data in Tencent Game Platform (Tencent). The basic information of the three datasets is summarized in Table I , where Dia is standard tabular data while the others are event log data with real industrial complexity.\\nDia Dataset : This tabular dataset contains 253,680 instances, where each instance has 21 features and is labeled with a binary class. The feature engineering functions are independently applied to each instance in the dataset, where the output features are used for downstream classification. Here, we split 55% of the samples for ML model training, and the remaining 45% of the samples are used for validation.\\nTaobao Dataset : This industrial log dataset contains 176,773 users, 9599 items, and 420,721 ad records over 7 days, where each record is labeled with a binary ad impression. The data is organized across five relational tables containing basic identifiers, item profiles, user demographics, contextual signals, and shop reputation metrics, which constitute 31 features for each record. The feature engineering functions jointly process the entire log data and output the features for each user-ad pair. Following standard temporal evaluation protocols, the dataset is chronologically split with the initial 6 days for training and the final day for testing, effectively simulating real-world conversion prediction scenarios where models forecast future conversion behavior based on learned historical patterns.\\nTencent Dataset : This dataset is collected from a Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game in Tencent for a few days, where the players are sampled from the same user profile to satisfy the i.i.d assumption. Each player is associated with a churn label, indicating whether the user will churn in the next day. In our scenario, each player can have multiple game plays in a day, which results in multiple event log instances. Furthermore, each player in the same game can have multiple teammates, and if the player has more than one teammate, we will separate the records into different rows. Therefore, the instances in such event log data do not follow the i.i.d assumption as mentioned in the introduction session. The feature engineering functions jointly process the entire log data and output the features for each player. The downstream churn prediction is thus working on player level. For evaluation, a temporal split is adopted: the former day of data are used for training, and the logs from the latter day are held out for testing.\\nWe evaluate the performance of our proposed FELA system against three baselines: (1) raw features, (2) FeatLLM [ 57 ] , and (3) LLM-FE [ 12 ] , where FeatLLM and LLM-FE are state-of-the-art free coding methods. To ensure a fair comparison, all LLM-based methods, including the baselines and our proposed FELA, utilize the DeepSeek-V3 model via the DeepSeek API [ 58 ] .\\nThe feature engineering for FELA and the LLM-FE baseline is optimized using the AUC-score, which we denote as the target metric ℛ \\\\mathcal{R} in Equation\\xa0( 1 ). The generated features of all methods are then evaluated using a Random Forest classifier by default, with performance reported across five standard metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC.\\nTable II presents the feature engineering performance of FELA and baseline methods on the tabular Dia dataset. The proposed FELA achieves superior performance in accuracy, precision, and AUC, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling structured data. Notably, FELA improves precision from 0.514 to 0.552 and AUC from 0.802 to 0.812 compared to the runner-up method LLM-FE, indicating its capability to generate high-quality discriminative features for tabular data analysis.\\nOn the Taobao conversion prediction dataset, FELA maintains its competitive advantage as shown in Table III . Our method obtains the highest scores in accuracy, precision, F1-score, and AUC, with a notable AUC improvement from 0.641 to 0.653 over LLM-FE. This consistent superiority across multiple metrics confirms FELA’s robustness in processing complex industrial log data with relational characteristics.\\nThe evaluation on the Tencent user churn dataset further validates FELA’s superiority on complex industrial log data. As summarized in Table IV , FELA outperforms all baselines in accuracy, precision, F1-score, and AUC, achieving a significant AUC boost from 0.686 to 0.701 compared to LLM-FE. These results across three distinct domains demonstrate that FELA consistently generates semantically meaningful features that enhance predictive performance in diverse real-world industrial scenarios.\\nWe begin by analyzing the complexity of the generated feature engineering code on the Taobao dataset, as illustrated in Figure 8 . After 16 hours of execution, the proposed FELA framework generates 22 features derived from 5 distinct feature ideas, achieving an AUC score of 0.653, an improvement of 0.023 over the raw features. This demonstrates FELA’s capability to efficiently produce a substantial number of high-quality features. In contrast, the FeatLLM baseline generates 20 new features within 2 minutes, yet yields negligible AUC improvement compared to raw features. Meanwhile, LLM-FE produces 110 code snippets within 30 minutes, with the best-performing code improving AUC by 0.011. However, the optimal LLM-FE code only creates only 1 new feature and lacks a continuous evolution mechanism, ultimately limiting its performance potential.\\nWe further investigate the feature correlation patterns in FELA by analyzing the Pearson correlation heatmap of the aforementioned 22 features, as visualized in Figure 9 . The analysis reveals that features derived from the same idea exhibit stronger intra-idea correlation. This phenomenon aligns with expectations, as features originating from the same semantic insight naturally share underlying conceptual foundations. Conversely, inter-idea feature correlations remain relatively low, indicating that FELA successfully explores diverse regions of the feature space. This structured exploration strategy demonstrates FELA’s capability to conduct steerable feature generation while maintaining semantic interpretability. The framework effectively balances between exploiting productive semantic directions and exploring novel feature combinations, resulting in both discriminative power and explanatory value. In Figure 10 , we visualize the sampled knowledge database after evolution on the Taobao dataset. We can easily trace the evolution of knowledge base structure, as well as understand the evolutionary trajectories between the ideas and associated features.\\nWe investigate the applicability of the proposed FELA over various machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, and Logistic classifiers. Then, the AUC performance of the proposed FELA and the baselines over the Tencent dataset is shown in Figure 7 . It can be observed that the proposed FELA can achieve the best AUC performance over most of the classifiers, where a 0.012 AUC improvement can be achieved on average. Thus, the proposed FELA system can serve as a robust feature engineering solution for various machine learning models.\\nWe conduct the ablation study in FELA systems to investigate the contribution of its components, including the critic agent, long-short-term memory, and the UCB-based learning algorithm. Then, the AUC in different iterations for the proposed FELA and its ablations is plotted in Figure 11 . The ablations without the critic agent and the long-short term memory lead to an obvious AUC decline of around 0.01. Thus, the proposed FELA can benefit from long-short-term memory to exploit the evolution experience. Additionally, the critic agent can enhance the correctness and consistency of the generated idea and code, which improves the robustness in feature generation and evaluation in FELA. For the ablation without the UCB-based learning algorithm, it can be found that the target AUC monotonically increases at a slower pace and converges to a lower value. Hence, proposed UCB-based learning can better balance the exploitation and exploration, which enhances the efficiency of the proposed FELA system.',\n",

Notably, FELA improves precision from 0.514 to 0.552 and AUC from 0.802 to 0.812 compared to the runner-up method LLM-FE, indicating its capability to generate high-quality discriminative features for tabular data analysis.\\nOn the Taobao conversion prediction dataset, FELA maintains its competitive advantage as shown in Table III . Our method obtains the highest scores in accuracy, precision, F1-score, and AUC, with a notable AUC improvement from 0.641 to 0.653 over LLM-FE. This consistent superiority across multiple metrics confirms FELA’s robustness in processing complex industrial log data with relational characteristics.\\nThe evaluation on the Tencent user churn dataset further validates FELA’s superiority on complex industrial log data. As summarized in Table IV , FELA outperforms all baselines in accuracy, precision, F1-score, and AUC, achieving a significant AUC boost from 0.686 to 0.701 compared to LLM-FE.

       "      'paragraphs': 'We begin by analyzing the complexity of the generated feature engineering code on the Taobao dataset, as illustrated in Figure 8 . After 16 hours of execution, the proposed FELA framework generates 22 features derived from 5 distinct feature ideas, achieving an AUC score of 0.653, an improvement of 0.023 over the raw features. This demonstrates FELA’s capability to efficiently produce a substantial number of high-quality features. In contrast, the FeatLLM baseline generates 20 new features within 2 minutes, yet yields negligible AUC improvement compared to raw features. Meanwhile, LLM-FE produces 110 code snippets within 30 minutes, with the best-performing code improving AUC by 0.011. However, the optimal LLM-FE code only creates only 1 new feature and lacks a continuous evolution mechanism, ultimately limiting its performance potential.\\nWe further investigate the feature correlation patterns in FELA by analyzing the Pearson correlation heatmap of the aforementioned 22 features, as visualized in Figure 9 . The analysis reveals that features derived from the same idea exhibit stronger intra-idea correlation. This phenomenon aligns with expectations, as features originating from the same semantic insight naturally share underlying conceptual foundations. Conversely, inter-idea feature correlations remain relatively low, indicating that FELA successfully explores diverse regions of the feature space. This structured exploration strategy demonstrates FELA’s capability to conduct steerable feature generation while maintaining semantic interpretability. The framework effectively balances between exploiting productive semantic directions and exploring novel feature combinations, resulting in both discriminative power and explanatory value. In Figure 10 , we visualize the sampled knowledge database after evolution on the Taobao dataset. We can easily trace the evolution of knowledge base structure, as well as understand the evolutionary trajectories between the ideas and associated features.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Large vision–language models (LVLMs) integrate visual and textual modalities, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and expanding their application scope. However, this increased capability also enlarges the attack surface. Malicious users can exploit cross-modal interactions and the continuous nature of visual embedding spaces, which makes adversarial defenses especially challenging. Cross-modality adversarial attacks exploit visual vulnerabilities and modality shifts in semantic meaning. Examples include pixel-level perturbations that embed harmful intent within images [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , malicious content rendered via typography or flowcharts [ 4 ] , harmful behaviors that emerge only from the combination of benign-looking text and visual inputs, implicit cross-modal interactions that obscure adversarial intent [ 5 ] , and hybrid or ensemble strategies that combine these mechanisms [ 6 ] .\\nExisting defense for LVLMs include preprocessing, model-level, and postprocessing techniques [ 7 ] . Preprocessing methods, such as input safety classifiers, purification techniques, and safety-augmented prompting, proactively intercept unsafe content before inference. Model-level defenses strengthen robustness through retraining or fine-tuning on curated datasets [ 8 , 9 ] , but incur high computational and data costs. Postprocessing approaches filter or re-rank model outputs based on partial solution evaluations [ 10 , 11 ] . In practice, many systems adopt hybrid pipelines that integrate multiple stages for more comprehensive protection.\\nA representative inference-time safety framework, ETA (Evaluating Then Aligning Safety of Vision-Language Models at Inference Time) [ 10 ] , adopts a two-stage pipeline combining keyword-based preprocessing and reward-model-guided postprocessing. In the evaluation phase, BLIP similarity scores are computed against a fixed set of risk categories, namely harmful, pornographic, sexual, unsafe, violent, illegal, and privacy. Higher similarity indicates greater risk. The alignment phase employs reward-model scoring and best-of-N sampling to select safer outputs. Although ETA improves safety moderation without retraining, it remains limited by rigid rule-based categorization and high computational cost, reducing its flexibility in handling nuanced or unseen multimodal threats.\\nRecently, agentic methods have demonstrated strong potential across diverse domains, enabling autonomous reasoning, structured tool use, and collaborative multi-agent interactions [ 12 , 13 ] . These systems exhibit adaptability and context awareness, making them promising not only for complex task execution but also forsafety governance.\\nBuilding upon these insights, we propose Agentic Moderation : a model-agnostic framework that rethinks safety alignment as a collaborative, multi-agent process. Our approach coordinates a suite of specialized agents including a SHIELD agent for fine-grained policy checks and action guidance, a Responder Agent for core task execution, an Evaluator Agent for response evaluation, and a Reflection Agent for response refinement and feedback. This multi-agent workflow provides modular, interpretable, and adaptable guardrails that can evolve with emerging risks and changing safety policy contexts, providing robust, multi-layered moderation for vision-language systems.\\nIn summary, this work explores how agentic architectures can serve as moderation layers for multimodal models. Our main contributions are as follows:\\nWe propose an Agentic Moderation Framework that reconceptualizes safety alignment as a collaborative, multi-agent process for adaptive and interpretable moderation.\\nBased on this framework, we design a concrete agentic moderation system for defending LVLMs against cross-modal adversarial attacks, comprising a SHIELD agent for fine-grained safety guidance, an Evaluator agent for assessment, and a Reflection agent for adaptive refinement.\\nThrough extensive experiments across five datasets and four LVLMs, our method reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19% while keeping Non-Following Rate (NF) stable and improving Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust and well-balanced moderation performance.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'We introduce the Agentic Moderation Framework, which conceptualizes safety alignment as a collaborative, multi-agent process. Rather than viewing moderation as a static classification or rule-based filtering step, our framework organizes it into an adaptive, policy-grounded workflow involving four specialized agents. Each agent contributes to a coordinated moderation cycle that iteratively refines model behavior toward policy-compliant, high-utility outputs. The overall architecture and process are illustrated in Figure 1 .\\nAs shown in Figure 1 , the framework operates as an iterative loop managed by a central Coordinator. The Coordinator orchestrates four specialized agents—Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector—each responsible for a distinct moderation function.\\nThe moderation process begins with the Shield Agent, which performs policy-aware classification of multimodal inputs and determines appropriate moderation actions. The Responder Agent then generates candidate outputs under the guidance of moderation cues provided by the Shield. The Evaluator Agent assesses these responses based on safety and utility criteria. If violations are detected, the Reflector Agent analyzes the failure and produces corrective feedback for regeneration. This cycle continues until a safe and policy-compliant response is obtained.\\nAll agents are designed to be lightweight, modular, and extensible. Thresholds, routing logic, and tool configurations can be easily customized, allowing seamless integration of new policies, classifiers, or evaluation metrics without retraining the base model. This design ensures flexibility and scalability across deployment contexts.\\nThe Shield Agent performs the initial safety screening. It classifies multimodal inputs (text and images) into 45 predefined policy categories, each corresponding to a moderation action: block, reframe, or forward [ 25 ] .\\nBlock: Unsafe queries that should be blocked.\\nReframe: Inputs are reformulated with safe alternatives or ethical framing.\\nForward: Inputs are judged safe and passed through for generation.\\nFor reframed or forwarded cases, the Shield augments the input with contextual guidance in the form of “should do” and “should not do” instructions. These cues along with action(block, reframe, and forward) are appended to the prompt and passed to the Responder Agent for controlled generation.\\nThe Responder Agent integrates moderation cues directly into the generative process. It uses a configurable Vision-Language Model (VLM) backend to produce candidate outputs conditioned on the Shield’s guidance. By incorporating explicit “should do,” “should not do” prompts, and corresponding actions, the Responder balances safety preservation with task utility. The outputs are subsequently passed to the Evaluator for verification.\\nThe Evaluator Agent validates candidate responses using predefined safety rubrics and utility metrics. We adopt the SeeThreats framework [ 26 ] , implemented via DSPy with the evaluation signature shown in Figure 3 . The Evaluator classifies each response as completion,refusal, and instruction non-following, and quantifies harmfulness on a Likert scale.\\nThe Reflector Agent consolidates information from the Shield’s policy decisions, and user intent to diagnose the causes of unsafe or low-quality outputs. Using reflection tools and large language models, it generates structured feedback describing the failure context and prescribes corrective guidance, tagged as ’Issue—Fix’.

As shown in Figure 5 , points closer to the lower-left corner represent configurations with both low ASR and NF, indicating an optimal balance between safety and utility. Our goal is to move model behavior toward this region.\\nLLaMA\\nLLaVA-1.5\\nLLaVA-1.6\\nQwen2.5-7B\\nTable I (also visualized in Figure 5 ) presents model-level outcomes under different moderation configurations. Overall, the combination of the Shield and Reflection Agents achieves the most consistent and substantial improvements, notably reducing completion and instruction non-following rates across the LLaVA variants. For LLaMA, the combined setup increases the refusal rate by 17%, primarily through a decrease in non-following responses. Qwen2.5-7B similarly shows reduced non-following and improved refusal behavior.\\nBoth the Shield and Reflection Agents improve safety performance, with the Shield generally providing stronger and more stable gains. The Reflection Agent, while slightly less effective, still delivers measurable improvements, demonstrating its practical value as a lightweight enhancement. In practice, the choice between them can depend on latency and computational constraints—using the Shield alone offers robust protection with minimal overhead, whereas combining both yields the best overall safety–utility trade-off.\\nFigure 6 and Table II present dataset-level results across five representative attack types: AdvBench, FigStep, Flowchart, MMSafety, and SIUO. All evaluated Vision–Language Models benefit from the proposed moderation strategies, though to varying extents. However, some models achieve comparable performance using only one module. For instance, Reflection alone nearly matches the combined configuration on FigStep and Flowchart, where attacks rely on semantic misdirection rather than explicit content. In contrast, Shield alone performs well on MMSafety and SIUO, where threats are visually grounded and easier to detect pre-inference.\\nNotably, Flowchart and SIUO attacks exhibit relatively low ASR and high RR across all configurations, as models tend to generate descriptive rather than harmful content. In Flowchart, the task typically instructs the model to describe and elaborate on flow diagrams, using much of the token budget for neutral explanation and leaving limited capacity for generation. Meanwhile, SIUO contains implicit, culturally nuanced cases (e.g., “Should I give my mother yarn for her birthday?”) where seemingly benign questions encode subtle social implications. Such ambiguity challenges models’ cultural and contextual reasoning but rarely triggers overtly unsafe responses.\\nOverall, these findings demonstrate that both Shield and Reflection are independently effective and can be flexibly deployed based on dataset characteristics and application scenarios: Shield suits real-time or low-latency moderation, while Reflection benefits post-hoc auditing and interpretability-sensitive contexts. Together, they form a robust, adaptive defense framework for diverse cross-modality adversarial settings.\\nThe integration of safety layers introduces moderate latency to the inference process. As shown in Table III , the Shield module adds only a negligible preprocessing overhead, typically around 0.015 seconds per query, as it operates through lightweight intent classification and policy lookup. Reflection, which performs post-hoc self-evaluation and potential regeneration, contributes approximately 1.5 seconds on average, with a maximum of two iterations allowed. If the first reflection deems the output safe, the process converges early without regeneration. Overall, the total inference time—comprising Shield, Reflection, and model generation—remains efficient, indicating that the added safety mechanisms achieve meaningful protection with minimal latency cost.\\nIn order to evaluate utility preservation under different safety configurations, we conduct experiments on MMBench (See Table IV ). The results show that models with higher capability generally exhibit stronger utility retention when safety mechanisms are applied. Advanced models such as LLaVA-1.6 and Qwe-2.5-7B maintain performance close to their vanilla setup, indicating that their safety layers impose minimal degradation.\\nTo illustrate how each agent contributes to safety, Table V presents a concrete example from FigStep. Without any safety layer, the model directly generates detailed descriptions of fraudulent tools, showing strong instruction-following but lacking safety awareness.\\nWhen Shield is applied, it classifies the query as related to fraud, scams, and deception, following predefined “should do” and “should not do” policies. In this case, Shield’s safety policy specifies that the model should educate users about scam awareness or explain phishing mechanisms in theory, but should not generate real phishing emails or scam scripts. Based on this guidance, Shield provides actionable moderation feedback, which is redirecting the unsafe request toward educational or awareness-building content. With this structured intervention, the model fulfills the user’s request responsibly while embedding appropriate safety warnings.\\nWhen Reflector is integrated, the system performs an additional self-review after Shield’s intervention. Reflector analyzes the user input, Shield’s guidance, and the model’s initial output to identify safety violations or unsafe phrasing. In this case, it flags that the response describes tools for creating fake credit cards and payment gateways—content that could enable fraudulent activities and therefore violates safety rules. Reflector then provides targeted feedback, suggesting that the response be reframed to focus on legitimate testing practices, such as using mock data generators or sandbox environments. Guided by this reflection, the model regenerates a revised answer that situates the task in a safe research context, maintaining informativeness while fully eliminating safety risks.\\nTogether, these agents form a layered safety mechanism: Shield acts as a frontline filter for harmful intent, while Reflector functions as a post-hoc auditor ensuring consistent, interpretable, and policy-aligned outputs. This synergy exemplifies how agentic moderation enables adaptive, context-sensitive safety alignment while preserving response utility.\\nAgentic moderation provides a highly flexible framework for creating safety guardrails that can be customized according to specific application contexts, regional policies, cultural or religious norms, and age-related considerations. Its modular architecture allows practitioners to select and compose different agents such as the Shield, Evaluator, Reflection, Steering, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) modules, depending on the requirements of each deployment scenario. For example, latency-sensitive systems may prioritize lightweight filtering through the Shield Agent, while high-stakes or user-facing applications can include additional evaluative and reflective components to provide stronger safety assurance. This configurability enables agentic moderation to adapt effectively across diverse operational settings and to support both proactive defense and post-hoc correction in an extensible and policy-aware manner.\\nDespite its flexibility, the framework introduces a practical trade-off between safety robustness and inference efficiency. Incorporating multiple agents enhances moderation reliability but also increases computational cost and latency, which may constrain real-time or large-scale applications. Moreover, determining the optimal combination of modules and safety thresholds remains context-dependent and nontrivial, requiring careful calibration for each deployment.

By combining proactive filtering, evaluation, and reflective revision, it enables dynamic, context-aware moderation across textual and visual modalities. Experiments across multiple attack types show that agentic collaboration markedly reduces harmful outputs while maintaining instruction adherence.

We extend this paradigm to safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework that leverages specialized agents to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications(safe or unsafe), our method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents,including Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector,to achieve context-aware and interpretable moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7–19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF), and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4–20%, achieving robust, interpretable, and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety governance.'},\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'The core concept of our approach lies in a multi-stage pipeline that constructs the knowledge graph. The overall pipeline is shown in Figure 1 . This pipeline consists of three primary stages: Chunking, Tag Generation, and Knowledge Graph Creation.\\nIn the first stage, the input document is segmented into semantically coherent text blocks, chunks, following the standard text segmentation methods Pak & Teh ( 2018 ) . Each chunk is set at a fixed value that can range between 200–1200 tokens, depending on the overall document length (Figure 1 a). For instance, a document may be divided into multiple chunks, each capturing a coherent fragment of meaning (e.g., sentences or short paragraphs).\\nEach chunk is then passed to the Tagger, which is implemented as a controlled LLM call with a restricted prompt designed to extract key semantic entities or concepts, referred to as tags. The Tagger outputs a fixed-length list of tags per chunk, representing the most salient or contextually important terms identified by the model (Figure 1 b).\\nThe overall quality and interpretability of the downstream knowledge graph depend critically on what the Tagger determines to be “important.” In this study, the model was intentionally left general to evaluate baseline performance; however, domain-specific prompting can be used to bias tag selection toward certain concepts and suppress less relevant ones, thereby controlling the signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting graph (see Section 6 ).\\nUnlike conventional triplet-based knowledge graph extraction methods Etzioni et\\xa0al. ( 2015 ) , which rely on rigid subject-predicate-object relationships, our tag-based approach is structurally flexible. This flexibility offers two key advantages:\\nIt eliminates the constraint of directional, grammar-bound triplets, enabling the capture of co-occurring concepts that may not conform to syntactic relations.\\nIt facilitates the introduction of constrained tag vocabularies (domain-specific or general) in future iterations, providing a tunable framework for graph refinement and denoising.\\nAfter tag generation, a BambooKG subgraph is constructed for each chunk and incrementally merged into the global BambooKG. Each tag is represented as a node, while edges denote co-occurrence relationships between tags within the same chunk (Figure 1 c)\\nEdge weights correspond to the frequency of co-occurrence - that is, the number of chunks in which a given tag pair appears together. This frequency-weighted graph structure reflects an undirected associative network, where stronger weights indicate tighter semantic coupling between tags.\\nConceptually, this process parallels Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) in neuroscience, where connections between neurons that “fire together” are strengthened, forming the basis of associative memory Caporale & Dan ( 2008 ) . Similarly, in BambooKG, each update to edge weights signifies that the system has “memorised” new knowledge.\\nAdditionally, a second knowledge graph is generated to map the tags to their originating chunks and documents for final context retrieval in the query pipeline.\\nIn this work, we focus on establishing the baseline BambooKG without performing any explicit clustering, pruning, or noise reduction of tags. These post-processing and optimisation steps remain open directions for future exploration.\\nDuring memory recall, the retrieval process operates over the existing BambooKG structure generated during memorisation. The process begins when a user submits a query, which is first passed through the Tagger. Unlike the memorisation phase, the Tagger’s vocabulary is now restricted to the global tag vocabulary of BambooKG (that is, only the tags which are contained within BambooKG), ensuring that only known concepts are recognised. If the Tagger fails to identify any valid tags, it is assumed that BambooKG has not yet “learned” the requested concept.\\nThe Tagger extracts the set of query tags from the query (e.g., in “What pet eats fish?”, the tags pet and fish are identified from the existing vocabulary). These tags serve as starting points of search within the tag frequency-weight knowledge graph.\\nFor each query tag, BambooKG extracts a local subgraph to approximate the region of semantic relevance. Following a decay-based neighbourhood exploration, the top X first-degree neighbours (directly connected tags) and top Y second-degree neighbours (tags connected through an intermediary) are selected, ranked by their edge weights - i.e., the frequency of co-occurrence. An example of this process in shown in Figure 2 with X and Y being set at 2.\\nThis selective neighbourhood expansion approximates a form of associative recall, where strongly connected concepts are prioritised over weak or peripheral associations. For clarity of visualisation, only the top-ranked connections are displayed in the diagram, though the full graph traversal may include additional edges.\\nOnce the subgraph is defined, BambooKG identifies all document chunks that contributed to the formation of the retrieved edges (Figure 3 a). These chunks represent the episodic context associated with the concepts recalled, analogous to the reactivation of cortical traces by the hippocampus during biological memory recall Wiltgen et\\xa0al. ( 2010 ) . In this sense, BambooKG functions as a synthetic hippocampal index, reactivating distributed memory fragments that co-occurred with the query tags during learning.\\nThe retrieved chunks, aggregated across all relevant documents, form the final context. This context is then provided to the LLM, which synthesises an answer grounded in the recalled knowledge (Figure 3 b).\\nImportantly, BambooKG supports partial pattern matching, allowing recall to succeed even when the full combination of tags has not been observed before. If a query partially overlaps with known subgraphs (e.g., pet is known but fish is new), the system can still infer context from related neighbours (e.g., cat, dog, indoor) and construct an approximate answer. This mechanism parallels pattern completion observed in hippocampal memory systems, enabling the model to generalise from incomplete cues Grande et\\xa0al. ( 2019 ) .',\n",

Additionally, in each dataset, we compared BambooKG against simple RAG, OpenIE, GraphRAG and KGGen. The full results are presented in Tables 1 and 2 .\\nUsing these benchmarks, we demonstrate that BambooKG outperforms other knowledge graph methods in two critical parameters: data recall and average retrieval time, in both simple questions (HotPotQA) and multi-hop questions (MuSiQue).\\nWe believe that there are several reasons for this performance. To start with minor issues, OpenIE often generates incoherent or nonsensical triplets (“if” as a valid node). GraphRAG generates a small number of nodes per article, resulting in information being missed. KGGen, in turn, performs well on simple questions (HotpotQA) but struggles with multi-hop questions due to poorly performing clusters.\\nCuriously, GraphRAG showed inferior performance in HotPotQA in spite of its relatively good stance as shown in other research Xu et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ) . We believe the reason for this is twofold: GraphRAG KG tends to miss answer node entities Han et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ) ; and that the corpus contained distractor documents. We have used both the correct documents (supporting facts) and distractor documents taken from the context field to generate the corpus for the 100 randomly selected questions. This most likely led to incorrect community generation, which hindered the performance of GraphRAG.\\nIn addition to the weighted edges, two seemingly counterintuitive factors contribute to the satisfactory performance of BambooKG: lack of triplets and the usage of arbitrary nodes. At the expense of the increased graph size and the loss of rigid structure, this leads to the decreased information loss whilst preserving epistemic connectivity between separate documents. Additionally, the difficulty of forming adequate single- or few-word embeddings when applying RAG to knowledge graph triplets means that embedding-based search approaches would naturally experience information loss, as well as increased extraction time Amur et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ); Edge et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) .\\nAnother point of note is that BambooKG pipelines only use a single LLM call: one during the Memorisation Pipeline, to trigger the Tagger. The Recall Pipeline proceeds entirely without LLMs or embeddings, resulting in highly competitive extraction speeds.\\nOne downside of BambooKG is the increased context size when compared to other approaches. However, this is beyond the scope of this work, as the context window is entirely dependent on the LLM one uses and is wholly unrelated to the long-term memory approaches.',\n",

For the experiments run for this paper, the Tagger chooses arbitrary, generic tags, effectively summarising the text chunk into a set of discrete words. By focusing the Tagger’s attention on a specific domain (via fine-tuning or prompt engineering), we can achieve greater data retention and recall rates on specialised corpora. Another point of future research is the organic formation of communities and clusters (with or without LLM calls), which will become critical for graph navigation when the volume of information added into the knowledge graph becomes significantly large.

       "    'paragraphs': 'Motivation. Prompting an LLM to generate a complete AAW is feasible. While the output may differ from the exact desired workflow and can include some code issues, LLMs generally possess the necessary knowledge. Our experiments show that by identifying mistakes and iterating on the results, the quality improves significantly with each step.\\nHigh Level Idea. Break the full task into several smaller steps, each performed through a dedicated LLM call. By simplifying each request into a well-defined, closed-form prompt, mistakes and errors are dramatically reduced. This structured, step-by-step approach naturally supports a chain-of-thought reasoning process, allowing each component to build upon the outputs of prior steps with increased clarity and context. An additional important aspect is passing each response through a \"supervisor\" component, which evaluates the quality of the response concerning the user’s request and the previously completed steps. If the supervisor deems the result inadequate, it sends the output back to the responsible component for revision—encouraging iterative improvement across the workflow.\\nImplementation Details. AAW-Zoo-Generator is implemented using the LangGraph framework. Each LLM call is encapsulated as a node, which accesses relevant information and routes the output via the supervisor to the next node in the flow. All LLM calls use the gpt-o1 model, with no additional tools or external databases involved.\\nWe divide the full generator into three main steps, each comprising multiple components. The supervisor component operates independently and is not assigned to any specific step.\\nUser Request Analysis. The user provides a request for a generated AAW in simple natural language, with as much or as little detail as desired. The first component analyzes this request and produces a draft analysis. Next, a second component reviews the draft and generates clarification questions to address missing information. To simplify this step, each question includes a default response that the user can select if no specific answer is needed. Based on the original draft and the user’s answers, a finalized analysis is then generated.\\nWorkflow Design. Once the finalized analysis is obtained, a blueprint of the desired AAW is generated. This blueprint incorporates both user-specified architectural preferences and task-specific requirements. It defines the agents comprising the AAW, as well as the flow of information and agent connectivity.\\nBased on the blueprint, a fixed number of functionalities are then defined—10 for sequential and orchestrator-based architectures, and 3 for router-based ones. Each functionality includes a description, a representative query that would trigger it, the entry point in the AAW, and the approximate agent flow. Each functionality includes activating at least two agents and triggers a unique sequence of agents.\\nFinally, a tools component assigns relevant tools to each agent in the blueprint. Each agent is assigned at least one tool from a predefined set, allowing for flexible tool integration. In our dataset, we used three tools: an online search tool (Serper 9 9 9 serper.dev/ ), a summarization tool (Wikipedia), and an image generation tool (implemented by us using DALL·E API).\\nCode and Metadata Generation. We begin the code generation process at the agent level, generating code for each agent individually. Predefined templates are used for both general-purpose agents and special agents (e.g., Orchestrator, Router). Once all agents are generated, their code is assembled into a unified AAW script using architecture-specific templates.\\nAfter the full code is produced, it is passed to a review component, which corrects syntax and logical errors, improves readability and flow, and returns the finalized code. This component also generates metadata, including a metadata JSON file and a CSV file containing a representative query for each functionality. In addition, the prompt of each agent in the generated AAW is saved separately, as it provides useful context for the query generation process. Finally, 150 queries per functionality, as well as 10-30 toxic queries, are generated offline based on this metadata.\\nWe present below examples of prompts used for some of the components in AAW-Zoo-Generator.\\nClarification question prompt:\\nBlueprint component prompt:\\nFunctionalities component prompt:\\nIn addition, the prompt used to generate 150 queries per functionality is given below:\\nLastly, the prompt used to generate toxic queries per functionality is given below.',\n",

Numerous code-oriented agents, such as OpenHands ( Wang et\\xa0al., ) and Swe-Agent (Yang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , aim to assist with complex project development and maintenance.\\nIn SWE benchmarks like SWE-bench (Jimenez et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , agents edit and repair code based on a given issue, then submit a pull request and validate execution. Within this workflow, configuring a runnable execution environment is the most fundamental and critical first step, yet it remains challenging for both human engineers and current LLMs ( Eliseeva et\\xa0al., ) , requiring substantial manual effort. This burden constrains large-scale, high-quality dataset production, making rigorous evaluation of agents’ environment configuration capabilities essential for progress in SWE.\\nMost existing environment configuration benchmarks rely on end-to-end success (build and test pass) (Milliken et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Bouzenia and Pradel, 2025 ; Eliseeva et\\xa0al., ; Vergopoulos et\\xa0al., 2025 ) , yielding only coarse outcomes and obscuring process-level capabilities along the configuration trajectory . For example, it is difficult to locate the specific stages in environment configuration where errors are likely to occur, or to identify which capabilities the agent lacks to perform more precise and effective configuration. They cannot pinpoint failure stages or missing capabilities, limiting deep insights and research directions.\\nIn addition, data construction is another bottleneck : high-quality, correctly buildable repositories are scarce; selecting and annotating them demands expert effort. As a result, it is challenging for researchers to obtain large quantities of high-quality data for evaluating agent environment configurations.\\nTo address these challenges, we focus on process-level evaluation along the agent’s configuration trajectory. Specifically, we investigate: (1) how agents apply planning to devise reasonable configuration steps and strategies given the task requirements; (2) how they use perception to accurately localize the causes of errors when failures occur (e.g., version incompatibilities or missing dependencies); (3) how they utilize feedback to analyze the errors and try to fix them; and (4) how they translate precise feedbacks into actions that correct these errors, complete environment configuration, and ensure that subsequent code runs and passes evaluation. This process-level trajectory evaluation provides deeper and more valuable references for improving agent capabilities in environment configuration and for subsequent related studies.\\nHowever, directly extracting the planning and feedback segments from agent trajectories, or evaluating entire long trajectories, is difficult. Inspired by how human engineers configure environments—typically following README steps first, then analyzing the causes of failures and attempting fixes—we consider editing an originally correct README by injecting erroneous commands or confusing steps. As the model configures the environment based on such a README, it must locate and repair these errors. This design enables process-level evaluation along the agent’s trajectory and allows us to observe which error types the model more readily repairs and which are harder to detect, providing valuable insights for future agent development.\\nMotivated by this task schema, we further design an automated data construction framework that scales instance generation and produces agent execution trajectories for training. We (1) select high-quality repositories via strict criteria; (2) employ advanced LLMs to edit key environment READMEs with common error types and annotate categories and suggested fixes; and (3) validate and filter for effective errors via an automated framework to obtain high-quality task instances. We then build an evaluation suite supporting both process-level analysis (error localization, repair) and end-to-end executability, along with an automatic data engineering pipeline that generates task instances and agent trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to enable process-level assessment for agents and to propose an automated data framework in this setting. Empirical evaluation on advanced LLMs and agents shows that, while agents exhibit basic error judgment/localization, they struggle to convert feedback into effective corrective actions, limiting end-to-end performance.\\nWe present our contributions and several noteworthy findings:\\nWe propose a trajectory-based EnConda-Bench for process-level evaluation of environment configuration in SWE, enabling detailed assessment of the capabilities agents exhibit during environment configuration.\\nWe introduce an automated data construction pipeline, which reduces manual labor and supplies large-scale training data for agents and LLMs.\\nOur evaluation across multiple LLMs/agents finds basic error localization/classification abilities but limited environmental interaction and feedback utilization, often yielding ineffective repairs, providing valuable findings and inspiration for future research.',\n",

       "   {'title': '3 EnConda-Bench',\n",
       "    'paragraphs': 'As illustrated in Figure 2 , EnConda-Bench requires agents to diagnose and repair environment configuration errors. Specifically, when an error arises, the agent should (i) identify the step at which the failure occurs, (ii) analyze the precise error type, and (iii) plan an appropriate repair strategy. Building on this, the agent should refine its feedback and corrective actions to ultimately produce an accurate shell script that fully configures the environment.\\nFor evaluation, we assess both (a) whether the environment is successfully built and executable, and (b) whether the agent’s trajectory demonstrates correct error localization, reasoning, and feedback usage. Concretely, the task design and full pipeline comprise three components: input task instances, agent execution, and evaluation.\\nEach task instance includes: (1) Repository. We collect and filter a set of high-quality GitHub repositories to ensure reproducibility and moderate difficulty. To avoid version drift during evaluation, each repository is pinned to a specific revision commit .\\n(2) Dockerfile. Following EnvBench ( Eliseeva et\\xa0al., ) , we supply a base Docker image with minimal prerequisites (e.g., Python, Conda). We run the agent to execute the environment configuration inside a Docker container.\\n(3) README. Both humans and agents typically begin from the repository’s README for environment configuration. Accordingly, each task instance includes the README as the primary guide for the agent’s execution.\\n(4) Labeled golden answer JSON. For each task instance, we provide a JSON file to support evaluation, including the golden answers of error types, detailed error descriptions, candidate repair command sets, and the final correct command sequence.\\nFor each instance, the agent leverages its planning abilities to devise a sequence of environment configuration steps, guided by the provided README. Leveraging its perception capability, the agent carefully examines the README and repository to identify potential errors. When encountering errors, it employs feedback , and analytically reasons them in detail and formulates appropriate repair strategies. Drawing on its action skills, the agent implements the proposed fixes and generates a shell script for the environment setup. After execution, we process the trajectory and extract error type judgments, repair commands, and the final shell script.\\nGiven the judgments extracted from the trajectory and the final shell script, we conduct two complementary methods for process-level evaluation. For error diagnosis, we compare the predicted error types, descriptions, and fix suggestions with the gold-standard JSON and compute the corresponding metrics. For executability, we pull the Docker and repository, run the agent’s shell script, and check whether it successfully builds the environment and passes the unit test. This evaluation suite yields a process-level assessment of the agent’s capabilities for environment configuration, highlighting which capabilities of agents are weaker, which error categories are more easily detected, and which are more challenging.\\nAlthough GitHub hosts numerous repositories, many do not meet the requirements for reliable environment configuration. If a repository is not reliable (e.g., due to a faulty README or missing dependencies), error annotation becomes labor-intensive and unreliable, and the resulting task may be prohibitively difficult. We therefore retain repositories that satisfy the following criteria that indicate higher quality: at least 10 stars, over 1,000 commits, and more than 10 closed issues. Furthermore, we incorporate repositories from existing benchmarks that have undergone strict human filtering and manual verification of environment setup, using them as the basis for subsequent error synthesis. Details about the repository selection are in Appendix A.1 .\\nAfter collecting high-quality repositories, we edit the READMEs to synthesize realistic, commonly encountered configuration errors. In fact, our initial plan does not involve synthesizing errors. Instead, we consider leveraging existing READMEs by decomposing them into executable steps (to assess whether each step runs correctly) or by annotating intrinsically error-prone steps. However, this approach is highly labor-intensive. Without step or error annotations, just using tools to conduct evaluation of overall agent trajectories would over-rely on the models themselves, making it difficult to extract key steps from long trajectories and to explore specific capabilities. In addition, each repository typically contains only a single README, and high-quality repositories are scarce, which constrains the number of available task instances.\\nTo address these issues, we treat each executable README as ground truth and inject errors. This enables scalable, automated task generation and supports process-level evaluation of planning, perception, feedback, and action during environment configuration. We define six canonical error categories: Dependency Installation Error , Command Usage or Syntax Error , File Path or Missing File Error , Logical Order Error , Version Compatibility Error , and Other Miscellaneous Errors (see Appendix A.2 for detailed definitions and examples). For each README, we prompt claude-4-sonnet and gemini-2.5-pro to introduce two errors and produce a structured JSON with the error type, description, candidate fixes, and ground truth, while instructing minimal edits limited to the necessary lines, avoiding broad rewrites that could compromise README integrity (detailed settings in the Appendix A.3 ). Taking strictly filtered original READMEs as reference, each case will yield a controlled error label, a concrete description, and a correct fix. From 323 repositories, we produce 1,772 erroneous READMEs, and each README contains exactly two injected errors.\\nWe then automatically validate the effectiveness of injected errors. An injected error is considered effective if: (i) following the erroneous README, the environment setup fails, and (ii) after repairing this error, the setup proceeds through the affected step. For each erroneous README, we use gpt-4.1-mini to generate a shell script and execute it inside the provided Docker environment (details in Appendix A.4 ). If the script succeeds in building the environment and passes the test, the corresponding error is regarded as invalid. We intentionally avoid stronger models at this stage because they may implicitly “auto-fix”, resulting in scripts that diverge from the erroneous README and thus undermine verifying the error’s effectiveness.\\nAutomated validation does not guarantee that the injected error is valid, so we conduct a second-pass validation to ensure (a) the error truly impacts configuration, (b) the error is explicitly manifested in the README, and (c) the categorization and proposed fixes are correct. To reduce human effort, we employ gpt-4.1-mini with predefined criteria (see details in Appendix A.5 ) to assess. The items that fail in this filtering are removed. Human evaluators then review the remaining data under the same criteria. The agreement between the LLM filter and human judgments reaches 98.5%, supporting the feasibility of this procedure. We ultimately preserve 1,230 valid erroneous READMEs, each containing two errors. To diversify difficulty, we further split and merge errors to construct READMEs containing 1–10+ errors, yielding 4,201 READMEs and 9,471 total errors.\\nAs described in Section 3.2 , we complete the benchmark construction. From 323 repositories, we construct 4,201 READMEs, averaging 13 per repository, the distribution shown in Figure 4 (a). We further stratify difficulty by the number of injected errors per README, defining levels 1–10, shown in Figure 4 (b). Most READMEs fall into level 1 or level 2, which aligns with real-world practice: a README typically contains 1–2 issues that hinder environment setup, but rarely many more. This ensures that task difficulty remains moderate for agents. Finally, in the error-type distribution in Figure 4 (c), the five standard error categories are comparable in count, each around 1,600 instances, contributing to a balanced dataset. The “Other” category contains only 312 instances, which both preserves coverage completeness and discourages agents from overusing a catch-all class. Compared with other benchmarks in Table 1 , our benchmark shows great advantages in evaluating the environment configuration capabilities of intelligent agents.\\nSince our task instances are constructed using LLM, these generated errors may not fully reflect the real-world task conditions, so we further verify the data quality. Nevertheless, we aim to further verify whether our generated data aligns with the difficulty level of real-world environment configuration tasks and reflects human cognitive patterns. To this end, we select existing environment configuration benchmarks, whose instances are directly sourced from real-world code repositories, and establish a criterion to assess the difficulty level of both these benchmarks and our tasks. Difficulty is rated on a scale from 1 (very easy) to 5 (very hard) by human experts (see Appendix B for details). The results shown in Table 2 indicate that the difficulty distribution and average scores of our tasks closely match those of the real-world instances, demonstrating that our dataset possesses realistic applicability and high quality.\\nAfter validating benchmark instances, we build an evaluation suite for environment configuration agents. Given the README and repository info, the agent plans and executes, producing a trajectory from which we extract perception (error diagnoses), feedback (repairs), and a final shell script for planning and action. Because a README may contain multiple errors, we compare the agent’s predicted error types/descriptions to the gold set and report precision, recall, and F1. We then match each predicted error description and fix to the gold answer, and use GPT-4.1-mini as a judge to assess consistency and evaluate accuracy. For executability, each script runs in a Docker container on a fixed commit. A run is counted as a pass only if the environment is successfully built, the test files execute correctly, and the process exits normally. Additionally, we propose an overall data-synthesis framework that automatically generates and verifies task instances from repositories, runs agents to collect trajectories, and produces evaluations for obtaining final post- and even pre-training trajectory data (more information in Appendix C ).',\n",

We define six canonical error categories: Dependency Installation Error , Command Usage or Syntax Error , File Path or Missing File Error , Logical Order Error , Version Compatibility Error , and Other Miscellaneous Errors (see Appendix A.2 for detailed definitions and examples). For each README, we prompt claude-4-sonnet and gemini-2.5-pro to introduce two errors and produce a structured JSON with the error type, description, candidate fixes, and ground truth, while instructing minimal edits limited to the necessary lines, avoiding broad rewrites that could compromise README integrity (detailed settings in the Appendix A.3 ). Taking strictly filtered original READMEs as reference, each case will yield a controlled error label, a concrete description, and a correct fix. From 323 repositories, we produce 1,772 erroneous READMEs, and each README contains exactly two injected errors.',\n",

For each erroneous README, we use gpt-4.1-mini to generate a shell script and execute it inside the provided Docker environment (details in Appendix A.4 ). If the script succeeds in building the environment and passes the test, the corresponding error is regarded as invalid. We intentionally avoid stronger models at this stage because they may implicitly “auto-fix”, resulting in scripts that diverge from the erroneous README and thus undermine verifying the error’s effectiveness.',\n",

We then match each predicted error description and fix to the gold answer, and use GPT-4.1-mini as a judge to assess consistency and evaluate accuracy. For executability, each script runs in a Docker container on a fixed commit. A run is counted as a pass only if the environment is successfully built, the test files execute correctly, and the process exits normally.

The model receives the task instance, targeted prompting for environment setup, and pointers to the repository’s README and directory structure, along with evaluation configuration details (e.g., Ubuntu version), and directly produces the setup. (2) Code Agents : specialized software-engineering agents that benefit from tool use and planning, often trained or optimized on large SWE workloads. We evaluate OpenHands ( Wang et\\xa0al., ) and SWE-Agent (Yang et\\xa0al., 2024 ) , both strong performers on SWE-bench-style tasks. (3) Environment-setup Agents : frameworks tailored to environment configuration, including INSTALLAMATIC (Milliken et\\xa0al., 2025 ) and Repo2Run (Hu et\\xa0al., 2025 ) .\\nWe evaluate agents on the environment setup as shown in Table 3 . Zero-shot LLMs exhibit high recall but low precision in error typing (e.g., GPT-4.1: Rec. score of 90.6 vs Pre. score of 33.4, F1 score of 48.8), with weak fix suggestions and poor end-to-end success performance. This indicates broad but noisy error perception and limited agentic intelligence. In contrast, code agents significantly improve error perception and corresponding repair feedback, for instance, OpenHands + DeepSeek-V3 achieves F1 score of 58.7 with a description accuracy of 51.9. However, the action and feedback abilities are still under exploration, with fix ACC. score of 33.8 and Pass@1 score of 9.1. Environment configuration agents deliver the largest end-to-end gains, showing better capability to utilize perception and feedback with execution action. We observe that Repo2Run + Claude-4 reaches F1 score of 60.6, description accuracy of 52.2, fix accuracy of 47.3, and Pass@1 score of 22.9, underscoring the value of environment probing perception and failure handling feedback. Nonetheless, the persistent gap between description and fix accuracy, and between fix accuracy and Pass@1, reveals bottlenecks of the agent in translating correct feedback into robust and valid execution actions. Our process-level evaluation of agent trajectories is therefore crucial, which guides targeted improvements rather than conflating all failures into a pass rate, which highlights that the agent planning process needs to be optimized, and we need to make better use of feedback information obtained from interactions with the environment, to truly enhance the execution capability.\\nFor each error type, we observe that the total number of predicted errors exceeds the ground truth shown in Figure 5 , indicating a conservative strategy with stricter checks. Sensitivity to specific error types is uneven: most models tend to overpredict the E1 category. There are also model-specific differences. For example, DeepSeek-V3 predicts very few E6 cases, fewer even than the ground-truth labels, suggesting under-detection for that error type. Finally, many cases are grouped into the catch-all “other” category, making E8 the highest or second-highest category. This is undesirable as users expect precise, actionable diagnoses rather than vague classifications. Consistent with the above, the overuse of “other” leads to a markedly low F1 score on E8 as shown in Figure 6 . Many instances that should belong to concrete types are incorrectly assigned to E8, inflating false positives for E8 and depressing recall for the true types. This hedging behavior hampers the practical value of error perception and feedback, degrading downstream planning and action. Beyond this, models show small but systematic performance differences across specific types. For example, the results show stronger detection for command usage and syntax error E2 but weaker for categories like file path error E4 that often depend on the agent’s system-level understanding of the entire repository and the interaction with the environment.\\nWe investigate the relationship between output tokens and performance to provide a comprehensive assessment of model efficiency. As shown in the Figure 7 , for the accuracy of error descriptions, most models exhibit a clear upward trend as the number of output tokens increases. In contrast, for the Pass@1 metric, allocating more tokens does not consistently yield improvements. For example, zero-shot Claude-4 uses three times as many tokens as zero-shot DeepSeek-V3 yet improves performance by only about 0.2. Notably, in certain agent frameworks (e.g., Repo2Run), performance scales more favorably with larger token budgets, indicating comparatively higher efficiency.\\nBeyond the above analyses, we further explore concrete cases to validate the effectiveness of our framework and support the claims. As shown in Figure 8 , we observe that models sometimes correctly judge the error type without actually locating the error commands, which undermines subsequent feedback. We also find that some proposed fixes differ from the golden solution, but our evaluation protocol can accommodate such variability, focusing on whether the issue is resolved rather than on exact match, thereby supporting the soundness of our methodology. Finally, we observe a relatively low pass rate. One key reason is that a single README may contain multiple errors, and models often fail to fix all of them. Moreover, during execution, a model may correctly diagnose an error and suggest an appropriate fix command, but fail to apply the feedback in the shell scripts used for environment setup, or it may introduce new faults. Notably, such errors are likely to arise during multi-round agentic iteration, as extensive edits can introduce additional mistakes.',\n",

We conduct experiments on advanced agents, and observe that in error perception, the agent demonstrates a certain level of capability, but tends to classify uncertain error types as “others”. However, when it comes to specific repair actions, the agent shows limited performance. We attribute this limitation to the lack of effective interaction and feedback mechanisms within the agent. Although it can identify errors, it struggles to plan the feedback information and interact with the real-world environment to provide better repair actions. In the future, enhancing the agent’s ability to strengthen its interaction with the environment will be an important research direction.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'The rapidly increasing number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in urban environments is due to the number of tasks they can perform, from surveillance and traffic monitoring to package delivery and their ability to reach locations that can be challenging for other aerial vehicles, such as helicopters. This also presents problems related to acoustic pollution and the risk of accidents. It is crucial to develop an efficient strategy for the autonomous navigation of UAVs in complex environments, not only to perform the aforementioned tasks but also to reduce their environmental impact related to acoustic pollution. Path planning becomes essential in order to reduce navigation time and minimize energy consumption. Navigation in urban environments is extremely challenging due to the complexity of the environment itself, with the presence of buildings and complex three-dimensional wind velocity distributions. The velocity field is characterized by the presence of turbulent wakes, vortex shedding, turbulent velocity fluctuations, gusts, recirculation zones and complex interaction phenomena due to the presence of obstacles [ 7 , 4 ] . Traditional path planning employs deterministic algorithms and heuristic methods. Popular algorithms are potential-field methods [ 17 ] , grid-based algorithms [ 26 , 30 , 6 ] , and sampling-based methods such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) [ 21 , 45 , 23 , 43 ] , as well as Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) [ 20 , 2 ] . Although these algorithms have been shown to be successful in environments which do not exhibit uncertainties, they yield poor performance in dynamic environments. Simultaneously Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithms include obstacle detection and avoidance by including a mapping of the environment [ 10 , 22 , 28 , 9 ] , but in large-scale environments they exhibit degraded efficiency since building a map of the whole environment is practically unfeasible. Deep-Learning (DL)-based methods\\nhave recently received significant attention. DL can significantly improve obstacle avoidance and path planning for UAVs by using neural networks to process and interpret sensory data, such as images from cameras, or LiDAR signals [ 34 , 24 , 29 ] or ground-based stations [ 42 ] .\\nThese methods allow UAVs to detect and avoid obstacles more\\nefficiently by recognizing patterns and predicting potential collisions in real time. Deep-Learning methods are extremely\\nefficient for environments featuring small variations, as they are based on labels and sensitive to environmental\\nchanges. They are suitable for closed geometries but less reliable for urban environments, where the conditions typically change very rapidly. This brings the necessity to develop reinforcement-learning (RL) methods to understand and automate decision-making processes, in which the agent learns by trial-and-error [ 33 ] . Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been successfully applied to UAV navigation tasks in complex environments. Bouhamed et al. [ 5 ] used a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to train quadrocopters to navigate in a three-dimensional environment avoiding collisions with static and moving obstacles. Wang et al. [ 40 ] implemented a Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Network Feature (Faster R-CNN) algorithm for obstacle detection, improved upon a traditional Deep-Q Network (DQN) approach. Collision avoidance capability was significant in unknown or dynamically changing environments. Sheng et al. [ 32 ] used a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) to train a UAV to navigate a highly dynamic environment with multiple obstacles achieving high success rates and efficient path planning. Wang et al. [ 41 ] proposed a Distributed Privileged Reinforcement Learning (DPRL) framework to address partial observability in navigation tasks, outperforming conventional vision-based methods. AlMahamid and Grolinger [ 1 ] introduced Agile DQN, an adaptive deep recurrent attention reinforcement learning method that enhances UAV obstacle avoidance by processing only the most relevant visual regions, achieving faster training and higher performance in simulated 3D environments. Raj and Kos [ 27 ] applied a DQN-based approach for mobile robot navigation in unknown 2D environments, showing effective obstacle avoidance and improved navigation performance. Zhao et al. [ 46 ] proposed an elastic adaptive DRL strategy to stabilize training in autonomous navigation tasks, demonstrating superior collision avoidance in multi-agent traffic scenarios. Berg et al. [ 3 ] combined deep reinforcement learning with nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for autonomous surface vessels, improving digital twin synchronization and obstacle avoidance through adaptive control policies. Recently, DRL has been applied to autonomous navigation tasks where the environment is given by high-fidelity simulations. Gunnarson et al. [ 13 ] applied a V-Racer algorithm with a Remember and Forget Experience Replay to discover time-efficient navigation policies to steer a fixed-speed swimmer through unsteady two-dimensional flow fields. Jiao et al. [ 19 ] showed that gradient sensing was critical for a navigation task in unsteady wake scenarios, applying DRL in a 2D unsteady flow field. The geocentric agent (with access to global direction) could reach the goal by sensing local flow velocity alone. However, the egocentric agent consistently failed with only local velocity sensors. An egocentric navigator needed the extra information on how the flow changed around it to break symmetries and reliably navigate the wake. Tonti et al. [ 36 ] used a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm [ 31 ] in combination with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells [ 15 ] for UAV navigation in a two-dimensional urban-like turbulent flow field obtained from a high-fidelity simulation. This study included random start and target locations, as well as random start snapshots, showing the adaptability of the agent in complex flow fields. The present study is an application to a three-dimensional urban environment, represented by a high-fidelity simulation, comparing three different architectures: PPO with LSTM cells, PPO with Gated Transformer XL (GTrXL) [ 25 ] , and PPO with GTrXL with an auxiliary task for flow prediction, in a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework, so that the UAV can further optimize its trajectory exploiting the prediction of the flow field of the next snapshot. Proximal policy optimization combined with GTrXL has recently been used for navigation tasks. Huang et al. [ 16 ] applied PPO+GTrXL in an indoor environment with obstacles, comparing the results with a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm [ 14 ] combined with a GTrXL. Federici et al. [ 8 ] applied PPO+GTrXL to a meta-reinforcement learning task applied to spacecraft navigation, showing an improvement in performance with respect to vanilla PPO. To the authors’ knowledge, this work is not only the first to bring PPO+GTrXL into a 3D turbulent flow field with obstacles obtained by a high-fidelity simulation, but also the first to integrate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) encoder, extracting spatial and temporal flow context, into GTrXL, and to train an auxiliary flow prediction head alongside policy and value objectives. This unified, multi-objective architecture, combining PPO+GTrXL and CNN+GRU embeddings, and transformer-based global attention for both control and real-time flow forecasting, represents a novel contribution to trajectory-optimization tasks.',\n",

Throughout this work, we adopt the following terminology to avoid ambiguity. An environment step refers to a single interaction between the agent and the environment, consisting of selecting an action, receiving a reward, and observing the next state. An episode is a full sequence of steps in the environment from an initial state to a terminal condition. A training iteration corresponds to one optimization cycle, during which the model parameters are updated using gradients computed from batches of collected data. An update step refers specifically to a single gradient descent update within a training iteration, when using several mini-batches per iteration. Performance metrics are plotted against training iterations. The methods compared in this section are described in Methods.\\nFigure 1(a) shows that the LSTM baseline (blue) leaves the\\nexploration plateau after 300 training iterations and\\nsaturates at R norm = 0.94 ± 0.5 R_{\\\\text{norm}}\\\\!=\\\\!0.94\\\\pm 0.5 .\\nReplacing the recurrent core with attention\\nraises the plateau to 0.98 ± 0.2 0.98\\\\pm 0.2 .\\nAdding the auxiliary flow–prediction head introduces a short\\nburn-in, yet overtakes the vanilla transformer by iteration\\xa0600 and reaches\\nthe top of the scale, 1.0 ± 0.1 1.0\\\\pm 0.1 .

Specifically, Zermelo achieves a success rate of only 61.3%, compared to 97.6% with flow-aware PPO+GTrXL, 95.7% with PPO+GTrXL and 86.7% with PPO+LSTM. This gap is primarily attributed to the open-loop nature of the Zermelo solution: the trajectory is optimized once using a single, randomly selected snapshot of the velocity field and a randomized initial UAV position, without any feedback or re-planning during execution. As a result, the computed trajectory is inherently brittle to perturbations and cannot adapt to the evolving flow field, which is especially detrimental in highly dynamic and partially observable environments.\\nIn contrast, DRL policies are trained in closed-loop settings and are explicitly optimized to generalize across a wide distribution of initial conditions and flow realizations. Architectures like GTrXL and LSTM enable these policies to encode temporal dependencies and respond adaptively to local variations in the flow. Furthermore, DRL agents can implicitly learn obstacle avoidance strategies and exploit transient flow structures through repeated interaction with the environment, capabilities that static optimization-based methods like Zermelo lack. These results demonstrate the critical importance of reactivity and temporal awareness for robust navigation in complex, time-varying environments, highlighting a fundamental limitation of classical optimal control when deployed in real-time.\\nFigure 2 shows two examples of trajectories given by the flow-aware PPO+GTrXL.

Second, it equips the agent with an implicit\\npredictive model of the local velocity field, enabling anticipatory actions\\nrather than purely reactive control.\\nThese mechanisms are supported by the sharp reduction in the collision rate and\\nthe smoother control spectrum observed during the zero-shot evaluation.

In contrast, the flow-aware GTrXL\\nsuccess rate reaches 97.6% of the same tasks, without any pre-planning\\nlatency, and produces shorter trajectories. Even the LSTM baseline\\noutperforms the Zermelo’s benchmark in reaching the target,\\nunderlining the inadequacy of closed-loop planners in highly disturbed\\ndomains.\\nBecause all returns are normalized to a common [ − 1 , 1 ] [-1,1] range, the curves are directly comparable. While all models exhibit similar initial performance, the Transformer-based architectures (GTrXL and Flow-aware GTrXL) show significantly faster convergence and higher asymptotic reward compared to the LSTM baseline. This is attributed to the architectural differences: LSTMs compress the entire temporal history into a fixed-size hidden state, which limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies, especially in partially observable and dynamically evolving environments. In contrast, GTrXL employs gated self-attention mechanisms with explicit memory access, enabling better retention and exploitation of temporally distant observations, which results in improved policy learning efficiency and stability.\\nThe Flow-aware GTrXL further extends this advantage by incorporating a multi-objective learning framework that includes a contrastive loss aimed at encoding the underlying flow dynamics. This auxiliary task enforces the development of latent representations that are sensitive to changes in the local flow field, thereby enhancing the agent’s ability to react to unsteady flow patterns during navigation. As seen in Figure 1 , the Flow-aware GTrXL reaches higher sample efficiency and generalization. These results confirm that coupling policy learning with auxiliary flow representation objectives can significantly improve robustness and adaptivity in complex, time-varying environments.

The dataset used for the DRL algorithms is a set of 300 snapshots separated by 0.08750 time units, with the time span of the dataset being 26.25 time units. Time is normalized with h h and the freestream velocity U ∞ U_{\\\\infty} . Due to the dimensions of the simulation results, an efficient pre-processing strategy had to be adopted. In order to avoid Input/Output (I/O) overhead during the execution of the algorithm described in subsection Algorithms, the flow field was split into small blocks for each snapshot. The original mesh of the numerical simulation was interpolated on a structured grid of 250 × \\\\times 250 × \\\\times 250 points. Each snapshot of the simulation has blocks of dimensions 10 × \\\\times 10 × \\\\times 10 mesh cells in x , y x,y and z z grid points. The blocks overlap to ensure that each cell of the domain is covered during the navigation of the UAV, so that the flow field can be continuously mapped. The core of the implementation is the lightweight, scalable framework combined with disk-efficient storage of the decomposed data and a local tricubic interpolation in space and time using KD-tree indexing.\\nAlgorithm 1 presents a lightweight, on-the-fly extraction of the velocity field in a block-decomposed simulation, performed using tricubic interpolation in space and cubic interpolation in time. Beginning with a mesh file that defines the global domain, the algorithm automatically scans a directory of per-block output files, each named by its time step and spatial indices, to build a time-indexed metadata map. For each stored timestep, it computes the physical spatial bounds of every block, determines the center of each block, and inserts these centers into a KD-tree to enable logarithmic-time nearest-neighbor searches.\\nAt query time for a given position ( x , y , z ) (x,y,z) and time t t , the algorithm first identifies the bracketing time interval [ t i , t i + 1 ] [t_{i},t_{i+1}] containing t t . The it performs spatial interpolation at four control times { t i − 1 , t i , t i + 1 , t i + 2 } \\\\{t_{i-1},t_{i},t_{i+1},t_{i+2}\\\\} to construct a cubic temporal interpolation stencil, with appropriate boundary clamping when fewer than four timesteps are available. For each control time, only the k k nearest blocks to the query position are considered, loaded on-demand using an in-memory cache to minimize disk I/O overhead.\\nWithin each relevant block, a parallelized tricubic interpolation routine (implemented via a pybind11 C++ module) computes the velocity components using Catmull-Rom splines over a 4×4×4 neighborhood. When multiple blocks contain the query position, their spatial estimates are combined via inverse-distance weighting to ensure smooth transitions across block boundaries. If no block strictly contains the query point, the algorithm falls back to using the nearest block regardless of its spatial bounds.\\nFinally, the four spatially-interpolated velocity vectors are blended temporally using Catmull-Rom cubic splines with the interpolation factor α = ( t − t i ) / ( t i + 1 − t i ) \\\\alpha=(t-t_{i})/(t_{i+1}-t_{i}) to produce the final velocity vector 𝐮 \\u200b ( x , y , z , t ) \\\\mathbf{u}(x,y,z,t) . The caching strategy ensures that once blocks around ( x , y , z ) (x,y,z) are loaded for one control time, they remain available for neighboring times, significantly improving performance in realistic workflows. By never storing the full four-dimensional dataset in memory, this approach scales efficiently to very large simulations while delivering fast and accurate reconstruction in both space and time.\\nDuring the UAV navigation, the underlying flow field components have to be retrieved to inform the agent with the velocity vector components in real-time. The procedure is explained in Algorithm 2 . First, the position of the UAV is clamped to the valid range of coordinates corresponding to the simulation domain. Then, the query position is quantized with the current time to form a cache key, checking if this specific time-position combination has already been computed. If the cache key is missing, the algorithm proceeds with full tricubic spatial and cubic temporal interpolation.\\nFor temporal interpolation, the algorithm identifies the bracketing time interval and constructs a four-point Catmull-Rom stencil using control times { t i − 1 , t i , t i + 1 , t i + 2 } \\\\{t_{i-1},t_{i},t_{i+1},t_{i+2}\\\\} , with appropriate boundary clamping when at the start or end of the time series. At each of these four control times, spatial interpolation is performed using the procedure described in Algorithm 1 , which employs tricubic interpolation within individual blocks and inverse-distance weighting to blend results from multiple overlapping blocks.\\nThe four spatially-interpolated velocity vectors are then combined using Catmull-Rom cubic splines in time with the interpolation factor α = ( t − t i ) / ( t i + 1 − t i ) \\\\alpha=(t-t_{i})/(t_{i+1}-t_{i}) . The final result is stored in the cache as the last valid velocity, and the velocity vector is returned. This caching strategy ensures that subsequent queries at nearby positions and times experience minimal computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy in the velocity field extraction.\\nThe UAV is modeled as a mass point with six degrees of freedom in translation and two in orientation, in particular yaw ψ \\\\psi and pitch ϑ \\\\vartheta . The state vector is defined as\\nand evolves under the combined influence of thrust V V , the turn rates expressed as Δ \\u200b ψ \\\\Delta\\\\psi and Δ \\u200b ϑ \\\\Delta\\\\vartheta and the underlying flow field velocity components 𝐮 𝐟𝐥𝐨𝐰 = ( u f , v f , w f ) \\\\mathbf{u_{flow}}=(u_{f},v_{f},w_{f}) . Note that u g , v g , w g u_{g},v_{g},w_{g} are the u , v , w u,v,w components of the velocity vector calculated as a sum of the UAV and flow field velocity components in each direction, respectively. Furthermore, x , y , z x,y,z are the coordinates of the position of the UAV at the current timestep. Since the UAV is represented as a mass point, the roll angle is not included in the system of equations, which is then described as:\\nΔ \\u200b ψ \\\\Delta\\\\psi and Δ \\u200b ϑ \\\\Delta\\\\vartheta are the variations of the yaw and pitch angles in the Δ \\u200b t \\\\Delta t time interval.\\nThe state of the UAV at time t + 1 t+1 is given by a classical fourth‐order Runge–Kutta integrator (RK4). In this work, Δ \\u200b t \\\\Delta t corresponds to 0.08750 time units and is divided into 40 RK4 substeps. Because the flow field is only updated every Δ \\u200b t \\\\Delta t , a single RK4 step would assume that the flow is spatially uniform along the UAV trajectory, leading to significant errors whenever the vehicle traverses regions of strong velocity gradients. By integrating the dynamics at 40 intermediate positions, we faithfully capture these spatial variations. Although RK4 is formally unconditionally stable for smooth ordinary differential equations (ODEs), coupling to a block‐decomposed interpolation grid imposes a pseudo‐Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (pseudo-CFL) constraint: the UAV must not step more than a small fraction of a block or execute a large angular deflection in one step, otherwise the KD‐tree lookups may skip blocks and cause artifacts. Using multiple RK4 substeps per timestep in the environment ensures a smooth evolution of the state of the UAV. This approach maintains continuity in position and orientation even when the agent applies maximum thrust and angular rate commands. Finally, having\\nblock‐tree structures and recently accessed block data remaining in memory, the additional integration calls per interval incur negligible extra I/O. Consequently, the sub‐stepping strategy delivers substantial gains in accuracy and robustness at minimal computational cost. These considerations justify the use of RK4 sub-steps per state update, yielding an effective balance between numerical stability and performance in large‐scale block‐decomposed simulations.\\nDeep reinforcement learning has been widely used in recent years for control and optimization in fluid mechanics [ 12 , 39 , 11 ] .\\nThe environment is built using Gymnasium [ 37 ] , an open-source library for reinforcement learning, focusing on the interface for simulation environments.\\nObservation and action spaces are continuous. The observation space is defined as:\\nwhere ψ , ϑ \\\\psi,\\\\vartheta are the yaw and pitch angles of the UAV, ψ target , θ target \\\\psi_{\\\\textrm{target}},\\\\theta_{\\\\textrm{{target}}} the relative yaw and pitch angles of the UAV with respect to the target, d target d_{\\\\textrm{{target}}} the Euclidean distance between the UAV and the target, x , y , z x,y,z the coordinates of the UAV in the domain, and θ i , ϕ j \\\\theta_{i},\\\\phi_{j} the elevation and azimuth angles associated with the obstacle detection sensors, with i ∈ [ 0 , 8 ] i\\\\in[0,8] and j ∈ [ 0 , 4 ] j\\\\in[0,4] , spanning the angles between − π -\\\\pi and π \\\\pi in their respective directions. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) graphically show the definition of the environment.\\nThe action space is designed to include thrust V ∈ [ − 2.0 , 2.0 ] V\\\\in[-2.0,2.0] and yaw and pitch changes Δ \\u200b ψ ∈ [ − π / 4 , π / 4 ] \\\\Delta\\\\psi\\\\in[-\\\\pi/4,\\\\pi/4] and Δ \\u200b ϑ ∈ [ − π / 4 , π / 4 ] \\\\Delta\\\\vartheta\\\\in[-\\\\pi/4,\\\\pi/4] , respectively. Obstacles are detected by providing the agent with a set of directions, since UAVs are in relation to the surroundings typically by images from cameras,\\nradar signals, or range finders. In this work, obstacle detection is achieved by implementing a\\nray-tracing technique [ 35 ] . First of all, the UAV has to check for free space in its perspective. The input is the position\\nof the UAV and the output is a boolean variable which indicates whether the path is free from obstacles or not. Then, if\\nthe obstacle is present, the intersection with the traced rays is computed. First, the direction of the ray is calculated,\\nbased on the ray origin and final point, as well as the coordinates of the obstacles. Then, it is verified whether parallel\\ndirections to the obstacles are present. If the detected directions are not parallel to the obstacles, the intersection point\\nbetween the ray and the obstacle is calculated and the distance to the intersection is returned. Figure 3(c) sketches the process.\\nThe starting and target points are randomly chosen before the first and after the second obstacle in the domain, as well as the initial orientation of the UAV. The starting snapshot of the algorithm is also randomly chosen among the 300 available. This setup is chosen so that the initial conditions of the flow field themselves exhibit uncertainties. The agent can take a maximum of 100 steps in the domain. The UAV state vector is defined in Equation ( 1 ) and it is inferred from the observations, which are given as input to the neural network and described in Equation\\n( 3 ). The problem described here can be then considered as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). A POMDP is characterized by the fact that the agent cannot directly observe the state s t s_{t} , but receives a set of observations o t o_{t} with a distribution p \\u200b ( o t | s t ) p(o_{t}|s_{t}) . The sequence of observations does not satisfy the Markov property, since p \\u200b ( o t + 1 | a t , o t , a t − 1 , o t − 1 , … , o 0 ) ≠ p \\u200b ( o t + 1 | o t , a t ) p(o_{t+1}|a_{t},o_{t},a_{t-1},o_{t-1},...,o_{0})\\\\neq p(o_{t+1}|o_{t},a_{t}) . Consequently, the agent has to infer the current state s t s_{t} based on the history of trajectories.\\nDRL is a process that encourages learning by trial and error and this process is triggered by a reward which is given to the agent when it takes the right actions to complete the assigned task. The structure of the reward is crucial because this guides the agent towards a more effective learning. This component of the algorithm has to be carefully designed and tuned for a specific task. The reward structure has been extended from the 2D version of the problem in Tonti et al. [ 36 ] . The reward structure is designed to guide the UAV towards the target, while minimizing collisions with obstacles, reducing energy consumption and preventing leaving the designated operational bounds. The reward function is given by several components, each one addressing a different aspect of the UAV’s performance. The final reward at each time step t t is the sum of:\\nTransition reward r trans r_{\\\\mathrm{trans}} : proportional to the reduction in distance to the target,\\nwhere σ ∈ ℝ \\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} is a scaling constant and 𝐱 \\\\mathbf{x} is the position vector.\\nObstacle penalty r obs r_{\\\\mathrm{obs}} : an exponential penalty based on the minimum distance d min d_{\\\\min} to any obstacle,\\nwith ξ , β ∈ ℝ \\\\xi,\\\\beta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} , and d min = min \\u2061 { d 1 , … , d n } . d_{\\\\min}=\\\\min\\\\{d_{1},\\\\dots,d_{n}\\\\}.\\nFree‐space bonus r free r_{\\\\mathrm{free}} :\\nwhere R free ∈ ℝ R_{\\\\mathrm{free}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} is a constant.\\nBest‐direction bonus r best r_{\\\\mathrm{best}} : when the forward direction is blocked, a small reward in proportion to the chosen changes in angles,\\nwhere Δ \\u200b ϕ , Δ \\u200b ϑ \\\\Delta\\\\phi,\\\\Delta\\\\vartheta are the yaw and pitch offsets of the best free direction.\\nStep penalty r step r_{\\\\mathrm{step}} : a constant negative reward per time step,\\nProximity–velocity penalty r prox r_{\\\\mathrm{prox}} : discourages high speed when very close to the target,\\nEnergy penalty r energy r_{\\\\mathrm{energy}} : proportional to the norm of the propulsion velocity,\\nCombining all the components, the reward is defined as follows for each time step t t :\\nAt the end of an episode of m m ∈ ℕ \\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} steps, we add:\\nTarget reached bonus : if ∥ 𝐱 m − 𝐱 target ∥ ≤ R target \\\\lVert\\\\mathbf{x}_{m}-\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\mathrm{target}}\\\\rVert\\\\leq R_{\\\\mathrm{target}} , then a positive constant is added to the reward and the episode ends. R target R_{\\\\mathrm{target}} is the radius of the target sphere.\\nCollision penalty : if a collision is detected, a negative constant is added and the episode ends.\\nOut‐of‐bounds penalty : if the UAV exits the domain, [ x min , x max ] × [ y min , y max ] × [ z min , z max ] [x_{\\\\min},x_{\\\\max}]\\\\times[y_{\\\\min},y_{\\\\max}]\\\\times[z_{\\\\min},z_{\\\\max}] , a negative constant is added, and the episode ends.\\nNear‐target bonus : if | ∥ 𝐱 m − 𝐱 target ∥ − R target | < 0.5 \\\\bigl|\\\\lVert\\\\mathbf{x}_{m}-\\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\mathrm{target}}\\\\rVert-R_{\\\\mathrm{target}}\\\\bigr|<0.5 , then a small positive constant is added.\\nThree different algorithms are compared. The first is the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [ 31 ] with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells [ 15 ] . The second algorithm tested is a PPO with a Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) unit [ 25 ] . The third is a PPO + GTrXL but with a dedicated auxiliary task to integrate a flow prediction head to improve UAV navigation in the environment. The task is then not only trajectory optimization, but a multi-objective DRL where the flow field is also predicted. The training is made on 200 snapshots of the dataset, while 100 snapshots are used for inference to test the learned policies in an unknown environment. In three-dimensional environments, the fixed-size hidden state of the LSTM and the inherently sequential update scheme limit its capacity to maintain and selectively recall the information necessary for effective policy learning. Although LSTM cells can mitigate short-term dependencies via gated memory updates, their recurrence still enforces a strict temporal bottleneck. Each new observation must propagate through all intermediate time steps before influencing the current decision, which can cause important distant events to be “forgotten” or diluted in the hidden state over long horizons. Moreover, LSTMs lack an explicit mechanism for relating non-adjacent states, making it difficult to capture the complex spatial relationships that arise in 3D domains. On the other hand, the GTrXL architecture embeds multihead self-attention layers with gated residual connections, allowing the agent to attend directly to any past observation regardless of its temporal distance. This non-sequential attentional access not only alleviates vanishing-gradient issues but also provides a flexible memory buffer whose capacity grows with trajectory length, enabling more robust encoding of 3D structure and long-range dependencies. Figure 4(b) shows the structure of a GTrXL block. The input sequence Y τ Y_{\\\\tau} enters the block and first undergoes input embedding ( E τ E_{\\\\tau} ), producing I τ I_{\\\\tau} , which is the embedded input. The core processing consists of two sequential components with gated connections. First, the multi-head attention layer computes queries ( Q τ Q_{\\\\tau} ), keys ( K τ K_{\\\\tau} ), and values ( V τ V_{\\\\tau} ) from I ~ τ \\\\tilde{I}_{\\\\tau} , applies attention with masking to hide future data ( A τ A_{\\\\tau} ) with relative positional encoding ( R τ R_{\\\\tau} ), followed by a GRU gate ( G τ G_{\\\\tau} ) that controls information integration and layer normalization. Second, a position-wise feed-forward network ( F τ F_{\\\\tau} ) is applied, followed by another GRU gate and layer normalization. Both components use skip connections (curved arrows) that enable direct gradient flow. The block maintains recurrent memory states M τ M_{\\\\tau} and M τ + 1 M_{\\\\tau+1} that persist across time steps, along with a hidden state H τ H_{\\\\tau} for capturing long-term dependencies. The output consists of the processed sequence and updated memory state M τ + 1 M_{\\\\tau+1} . The key variables are: Y τ Y_{\\\\tau} (input sequence), E τ E_{\\\\tau} (input embedding), I ~ τ \\\\tilde{I}_{\\\\tau} (embedded input), H τ H_{\\\\tau} (recurrent hidden state), M τ M_{\\\\tau} (input memory), M τ + 1 M_{\\\\tau+1} (output memory), Q τ Q_{\\\\tau} / K τ K_{\\\\tau} / V τ V_{\\\\tau} (query/key/value matrices), A τ A_{\\\\tau} (attention weights), R τ R_{\\\\tau} (relative positional encoding), F τ F_{\\\\tau} (feed-forward transformation), G τ G_{\\\\tau} (GRU gates). This architecture combines transformer attention mechanisms with RNN gating properties, enabling both effective sequence modeling and stable training dynamics through controlled information flow. Figure 4(a) shows the PPO+GTrXL architecture, where the MLP encoder is here the PPO algorithm. The observations y k − n , … , y k {y_{k-n},...,y_{k}} are the inputs to the encoder, which here is a PPO. The encoded observations are then fed to the GTrXL block, which receives a memory state M k − 1 M_{k-1} . The block outputs the hidden state H k H_{k} and a memory state M k M_{k} . H k H_{k} is passed to a linear activation layer, which outputs logits a k a_{k} and values V ^ k \\\\hat{V}_{k} . M k M_{k} is fed back as input of the GTrXL block.\\nThe third algorithm used in this work is a modification of the PPO+GTrXL. This custom model implements a PPO agent in which observations and turbulent flow history are first separately encoded, then jointly processed by a stack of GTrXL blocks, and finally decoded into three objectives: action logits, value estimates, and next‐flow‐snapshot predictions. A dedicated encoder ingests a sequence of past flow vectors with a predefined sequence length, applies multiscale 1D convolutions (kernel sizes 3 and 5) to capture short‐ and medium‐term temporal features, fuses them via a linear layer, and feeds the result through a GRU to model longer‐term dynamics, normalizing the output to produce per‐timestep flow embeddings. In parallel, the agent’s proprioceptive characteristics are projected through a PPO in the same embedding space. A small CNN processes a local flow patch into an embedding, which is concatenated along with the flow‐history and observation embeddings. All tokens are then augmented with learnable relative positional encodings and passed through GTrXL blocks, each combining multi‐head self‐attention with gated residual connections and a feedforward GRU to produce contextually enriched representations. Finally, the most recent observation token is routed to separate policy and value heads for PPO’s on-policy updates, while the most recent flow token is sent to a flow-prediction head trained with a supervised loss. By jointly optimizing control and flow forecasting within this multi‐objective architecture, the model leverages transformer-based global attention over CNN+GRU–derived embeddings to navigate and anticipate complex 3D turbulent dynamics in real time. Algorithm 3 gives the pseudo-code, and Figure 4(c) shows a sketch of the algorithm.\\nThe total loss is the sum of the basic vanilla PPO loss and a supervised auxiliary loss on the flow prediction. The auxiliary loss is based on contrastive learning. We propose a contrastive learning framework to improve flow-field representations by learning to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant flow patterns for navigation. Rather than relying solely on reconstruction accuracy, our approach is based on the principle that flows beneficial for navigation should have similar representations, while flows from different contexts should be distinguishable in the learned embedding space.\\nThe contrastive flow loss operates on predicted and target flow fields 𝐟 ^ , 𝐟 ∈ ℝ d \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{f}},\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} by first encoding them through a shared projection network ϕ : ℝ d → ℝ h \\\\phi:\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}^{h} comprising two fully-connected layers with ReLU activation and layer normalization. The resulting embeddings are L2-normalized to unit vectors:\\nWe define the positive similarity between predicted and target flows as their scaled dot product:\\nwhere τ > 0 \\\\tau>0 is a temperature hyperparameter. When negative samples { 𝐟 j − } j = 1 K \\\\{\\\\mathbf{f}_{j}^{-}\\\\}_{j=1}^{K} are available (sampled from different temporal steps or spatial locations), we compute negative similarities:\\nThe contrastive loss follows the Information Noise Contrastive Estimation (InfoNCE) objective [ 38 ] , which maximizes mutual information between positive pairs while treating negative samples as noise to contrast against:\\nThis formulation encourages the model to assign high similarity to the predicted-target pair while maintaining low similarity to negative samples. When negative samples are unavailable, we use the simplified objective ℒ contrastive = − sim + \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{contrastive}}=-\\\\text{sim}_{+} , which directly maximizes the similarity between predictions and targets. This contrastive formulation encourages the model to learn flow representations that capture meaningful structure, improving the agent’s ability to reason about flow dynamics for trajectory planning.\\nFinally, the results of the described approaches are compared with a classical optimization algorithm. This work considers the Zermelo’s navigation algorithm as applied in [ 18 ] ran on the 3D urban environment described in Section Environment of the DRL algorithm. The Zermelo’s optimal navigation problem minimizes a cost functional:\\nsubject to system dynamics, control bounds | u | |u| ≤ \\\\leq u m \\u200b a \\u200b x u_{max} , collision avoidance constraints, and domain boundaries.\\nThe term T f T_{f} represents the final time (mission duration), and its minimization promotes time-efficient flight.\\nThe control effort is penalized by the quadratic term\\nwhere χ \\\\mathbf{\\\\chi} is the control input vector (yaw rate, pitch rate, thrust), and R R is a positive definite weighting matrix. This term ensures smooth and energy-efficient maneuvers by discouraging large control inputs.\\nTo avoid collisions, the cost function includes an obstacle avoidance penalty\\nwhere d i \\u200b ( 𝐱 ) d_{i}(\\\\mathbf{x}) is the distance from the current position 𝐱 \\\\mathbf{x} to the i i -th obstacle, and α i , β i > 0 \\\\alpha_{i},\\\\beta_{i}>0 are tuning parameters that control the strength and sharpness of the penalty.\\nA terminal cost is imposed through\\nwhich penalizes deviations from the desired target position 𝐱 target \\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\text{target}} at the final time T f T_{f} , with κ > 0 \\\\kappa>0 controlling the importance of accurately reaching the target.\\nAll cost components involving control and obstacle penalties are accumulated over the trajectory via the integral\\nwhich ensures that efficiency and safety are maintained throughout the entire mission duration.\\nThe trajectory is parameterized using B-spline basis functions with control points C j C_{j} , transforming the infinite-dimensional optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear programming problem solved by sequential quadratic programming. Collision constraints are enforced through penalty methods using the environment’s geometric obstacle detection, while the flow field influence is incorporated through trilinear interpolation of the discretized velocity data at each trajectory evaluation point.\\nThis comparison is made to enable direct benchmarking between the classical optimization algorithm and DRL-learned policies.',\n",

All distances are scaled by the height of the upstream obstacle h h . The dataset used for the DRL algorithms is a set of 300 snapshots separated by 0.08750 time units, with the time span of the dataset being 26.25 time units. Time is normalized with h h and the freestream velocity U ∞ U_{\\\\infty} . Due to the dimensions of the simulation results, an efficient pre-processing strategy had to be adopted. In order to avoid Input/Output (I/O) overhead during the execution of the algorithm described in subsection Algorithms, the flow field was split into small blocks for each snapshot. The original mesh of the numerical simulation was interpolated on a structured grid of 250 × \\\\times 250 × \\\\times 250 points. Each snapshot of the simulation has blocks of dimensions 10 × \\\\times 10 × \\\\times 10 mesh cells in x , y x,y and z z grid points. The blocks overlap to ensure that each cell of the domain is covered during the navigation of the UAV, so that the flow field can be continuously mapped. The core of the implementation is the lightweight, scalable framework combined with disk-efficient storage of the decomposed data and a local tricubic interpolation in space and time using KD-tree indexing.\\nAlgorithm 1 presents a lightweight, on-the-fly extraction of the velocity field in a block-decomposed simulation, performed using tricubic interpolation in space and cubic interpolation in time. Beginning with a mesh file that defines the global domain, the algorithm automatically scans a directory of per-block output files, each named by its time step and spatial indices, to build a time-indexed metadata map. For each stored timestep, it computes the physical spatial bounds of every block, determines the center of each block, and inserts these centers into a KD-tree to enable logarithmic-time nearest-neighbor searches.\\nAt query time for a given position ( x , y , z ) (x,y,z) and time t t , the algorithm first identifies the bracketing time interval [ t i , t i + 1 ] [t_{i},t_{i+1}] containing t t . The it performs spatial interpolation at four control times { t i − 1 , t i , t i + 1 , t i + 2 } \\\\{t_{i-1},t_{i},t_{i+1},t_{i+2}\\\\} to construct a cubic temporal interpolation stencil, with appropriate boundary clamping when fewer than four timesteps are available. For each control time, only the k k nearest blocks to the query position are considered, loaded on-demand using an in-memory cache to minimize disk I/O overhead.\\nWithin each relevant block, a parallelized tricubic interpolation routine (implemented via a pybind11 C++ module) computes the velocity components using Catmull-Rom splines over a 4×4×4 neighborhood. When multiple blocks contain the query position, their spatial estimates are combined via inverse-distance weighting to ensure smooth transitions across block boundaries. If no block strictly contains the query point, the algorithm falls back to using the nearest block regardless of its spatial bounds.\\nFinally, the four spatially-interpolated velocity vectors are blended temporally using Catmull-Rom cubic splines with the interpolation factor α = ( t − t i ) / ( t i + 1 − t i ) \\\\alpha=(t-t_{i})/(t_{i+1}-t_{i}) to produce the final velocity vector 𝐮 \\u200b ( x , y , z , t ) \\\\mathbf{u}(x,y,z,t) . The caching strategy ensures that once blocks around ( x , y , z ) (x,y,z) are loaded for one control time, they remain available for neighboring times, significantly improving performance in realistic workflows. By never storing the full four-dimensional dataset in memory, this approach scales efficiently to very large simulations while delivering fast and accurate reconstruction in both space and time.\\nDuring the UAV navigation, the underlying flow field components have to be retrieved to inform the agent with the velocity vector components in real-time. The procedure is explained in Algorithm 2 . First, the position of the UAV is clamped to the valid range of coordinates corresponding to the simulation domain. Then, the query position is quantized with the current time to form a cache key, checking if this specific time-position combination has already been computed. If the cache key is missing, the algorithm proceeds with full tricubic spatial and cubic temporal interpolation.\\nFor temporal interpolation, the algorithm identifies the bracketing time interval and constructs a four-point Catmull-Rom stencil using control times { t i − 1 , t i , t i + 1 , t i + 2 } \\\\{t_{i-1},t_{i},t_{i+1},t_{i+2}\\\\} , with appropriate boundary clamping when at the start or end of the time series. At each of these four control times, spatial interpolation is performed using the procedure described in Algorithm 1 , which employs tricubic interpolation within individual blocks and inverse-distance weighting to blend results from multiple overlapping blocks.\\nThe four spatially-interpolated velocity vectors are then combined using Catmull-Rom cubic splines in time with the interpolation factor α = ( t − t i ) / ( t i + 1 − t i ) \\\\alpha=(t-t_{i})/(t_{i+1}-t_{i}) . The final result is stored in the cache as the last valid velocity, and the velocity vector is returned. This caching strategy ensures that subsequent queries at nearby positions and times experience minimal computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy in the velocity field extraction.',\n",

Obstacles are detected by providing the agent with a set of directions, since UAVs are in relation to the surroundings typically by images from cameras,\\nradar signals, or range finders. In this work, obstacle detection is achieved by implementing a\\nray-tracing technique [ 35 ] . First of all, the UAV has to check for free space in its perspective. The input is the position\\nof the UAV and the output is a boolean variable which indicates whether the path is free from obstacles or not. Then, if\\nthe obstacle is present, the intersection with the traced rays is computed. First, the direction of the ray is calculated,\\nbased on the ray origin and final point, as well as the coordinates of the obstacles. Then, it is verified whether parallel\\ndirections to the obstacles are present. If the detected directions are not parallel to the obstacles, the intersection point\\nbetween the ray and the obstacle is calculated and the distance to the intersection is returned. Figure 3(c) sketches the process.\\nThe starting and target points are randomly chosen before the first and after the second obstacle in the domain, as well as the initial orientation of the UAV. The starting snapshot of the algorithm is also randomly chosen among the 300 available. This setup is chosen so that the initial conditions of the flow field themselves exhibit uncertainties. The agent can take a maximum of 100 steps in the domain. The UAV state vector is defined in Equation ( 1 ) and it is inferred from the observations, which are given as input to the neural network and described in Equation\\n( 3 ). The problem described here can be then considered as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). A POMDP is characterized by the fact that the agent cannot directly observe the state s t s_{t} , but receives a set of observations o t o_{t} with a distribution p \\u200b ( o t | s t ) p(o_{t}|s_{t}) . The sequence of observations does not satisfy the Markov property, since p \\u200b ( o t + 1 | a t , o t , a t − 1 , o t − 1 , … , o 0 ) ≠ p \\u200b ( o t + 1 | o t , a t ) p(o_{t+1}|a_{t},o_{t},a_{t-1},o_{t-1},...,o_{0})\\\\neq p(o_{t+1}|o_{t},a_{t}) . Consequently, the agent has to infer the current state s t s_{t} based on the history of trajectories.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'DRL is a process that encourages learning by trial and error and this process is triggered by a reward which is given to the agent when it takes the right actions to complete the assigned task. The structure of the reward is crucial because this guides the agent towards a more effective learning. This component of the algorithm has to be carefully designed and tuned for a specific task. The reward structure has been extended from the 2D version of the problem in Tonti et al. [ 36 ] . The reward structure is designed to guide the UAV towards the target, while minimizing collisions with obstacles, reducing energy consumption and preventing leaving the designated operational bounds.

       "      'paragraphs': 'Three different algorithms are compared. The first is the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [ 31 ] with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells [ 15 ] . The second algorithm tested is a PPO with a Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) unit [ 25 ] . The third is a PPO + GTrXL but with a dedicated auxiliary task to integrate a flow prediction head to improve UAV navigation in the environment. The task is then not only trajectory optimization, but a multi-objective DRL where the flow field is also predicted. The training is made on 200 snapshots of the dataset, while 100 snapshots are used for inference to test the learned policies in an unknown environment. In three-dimensional environments, the fixed-size hidden state of the LSTM and the inherently sequential update scheme limit its capacity to maintain and selectively recall the information necessary for effective policy learning. Although LSTM cells can mitigate short-term dependencies via gated memory updates, their recurrence still enforces a strict temporal bottleneck. Each new observation must propagate through all intermediate time steps before influencing the current decision, which can cause important distant events to be “forgotten” or diluted in the hidden state over long horizons. Moreover, LSTMs lack an explicit mechanism for relating non-adjacent states, making it difficult to capture the complex spatial relationships that arise in 3D domains. On the other hand, the GTrXL architecture embeds multihead self-attention layers with gated residual connections, allowing the agent to attend directly to any past observation regardless of its temporal distance. This non-sequential attentional access not only alleviates vanishing-gradient issues but also provides a flexible memory buffer whose capacity grows with trajectory length, enabling more robust encoding of 3D structure and long-range dependencies. Figure 4(b) shows the structure of a GTrXL block. The input sequence Y τ Y_{\\\\tau} enters the block and first undergoes input embedding ( E τ E_{\\\\tau} ), producing I τ I_{\\\\tau} , which is the embedded input. The core processing consists of two sequential components with gated connections. First, the multi-head attention layer computes queries ( Q τ Q_{\\\\tau} ), keys ( K τ K_{\\\\tau} ), and values ( V τ V_{\\\\tau} ) from I ~ τ \\\\tilde{I}_{\\\\tau} , applies attention with masking to hide future data ( A τ A_{\\\\tau} ) with relative positional encoding ( R τ R_{\\\\tau} ), followed by a GRU gate ( G τ G_{\\\\tau} ) that controls information integration and layer normalization. Second, a position-wise feed-forward network ( F τ F_{\\\\tau} ) is applied, followed by another GRU gate and layer normalization. Both components use skip connections (curved arrows) that enable direct gradient flow. The block maintains recurrent memory states M τ M_{\\\\tau} and M τ + 1 M_{\\\\tau+1} that persist across time steps, along with a hidden state H τ H_{\\\\tau} for capturing long-term dependencies. The output consists of the processed sequence and updated memory state M τ + 1 M_{\\\\tau+1} . The key variables are: Y τ Y_{\\\\tau} (input sequence), E τ E_{\\\\tau} (input embedding), I ~ τ \\\\tilde{I}_{\\\\tau} (embedded input), H τ H_{\\\\tau} (recurrent hidden state), M τ M_{\\\\tau} (input memory), M τ + 1 M_{\\\\tau+1} (output memory), Q τ Q_{\\\\tau} / K τ K_{\\\\tau} / V τ V_{\\\\tau} (query/key/value matrices), A τ A_{\\\\tau} (attention weights), R τ R_{\\\\tau} (relative positional encoding), F τ F_{\\\\tau} (feed-forward transformation), G τ G_{\\\\tau} (GRU gates). This architecture combines transformer attention mechanisms with RNN gating properties, enabling both effective sequence modeling and stable training dynamics through controlled information flow. Figure 4(a) shows the PPO+GTrXL architecture, where the MLP encoder is here the PPO algorithm. The observations y k − n , … , y k {y_{k-n},...,y_{k}} are the inputs to the encoder, which here is a PPO. The encoded observations are then fed to the GTrXL block, which receives a memory state M k − 1 M_{k-1} . The block outputs the hidden state H k H_{k} and a memory state M k M_{k} . H k H_{k} is passed to a linear activation layer, which outputs logits a k a_{k} and values V ^ k \\\\hat{V}_{k} . M k M_{k} is fed back as input of the GTrXL block.\\nThe third algorithm used in this work is a modification of the PPO+GTrXL. This custom model implements a PPO agent in which observations and turbulent flow history are first separately encoded, then jointly processed by a stack of GTrXL blocks, and finally decoded into three objectives: action logits, value estimates, and next‐flow‐snapshot predictions. A dedicated encoder ingests a sequence of past flow vectors with a predefined sequence length, applies multiscale 1D convolutions (kernel sizes 3 and 5) to capture short‐ and medium‐term temporal features, fuses them via a linear layer, and feeds the result through a GRU to model longer‐term dynamics, normalizing the output to produce per‐timestep flow embeddings. In parallel, the agent’s proprioceptive characteristics are projected through a PPO in the same embedding space. A small CNN processes a local flow patch into an embedding, which is concatenated along with the flow‐history and observation embeddings. All tokens are then augmented with learnable relative positional encodings and passed through GTrXL blocks, each combining multi‐head self‐attention with gated residual connections and a feedforward GRU to produce contextually enriched representations. Finally, the most recent observation token is routed to separate policy and value heads for PPO’s on-policy updates, while the most recent flow token is sent to a flow-prediction head trained with a supervised loss. By jointly optimizing control and flow forecasting within this multi‐objective architecture, the model leverages transformer-based global attention over CNN+GRU–derived embeddings to navigate and anticipate complex 3D turbulent dynamics in real time. Algorithm 3 gives the pseudo-code, and Figure 4(c) shows a sketch of the algorithm.\\nThe total loss is the sum of the basic vanilla PPO loss and a supervised auxiliary loss on the flow prediction. The auxiliary loss is based on contrastive learning. We propose a contrastive learning framework to improve flow-field representations by learning to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant flow patterns for navigation. Rather than relying solely on reconstruction accuracy, our approach is based on the principle that flows beneficial for navigation should have similar representations, while flows from different contexts should be distinguishable in the learned embedding space.\\nThe contrastive flow loss operates on predicted and target flow fields 𝐟 ^ , 𝐟 ∈ ℝ d \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{f}},\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} by first encoding them through a shared projection network ϕ : ℝ d → ℝ h \\\\phi:\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{R}^{h} comprising two fully-connected layers with ReLU activation and layer normalization. The resulting embeddings are L2-normalized to unit vectors:\\nWe define the positive similarity between predicted and target flows as their scaled dot product:\\nwhere τ > 0 \\\\tau>0 is a temperature hyperparameter. When negative samples { 𝐟 j − } j = 1 K \\\\{\\\\mathbf{f}_{j}^{-}\\\\}_{j=1}^{K} are available (sampled from different temporal steps or spatial locations), we compute negative similarities:\\nThe contrastive loss follows the Information Noise Contrastive Estimation (InfoNCE) objective [ 38 ] , which maximizes mutual information between positive pairs while treating negative samples as noise to contrast against:\\nThis formulation encourages the model to assign high similarity to the predicted-target pair while maintaining low similarity to negative samples. When negative samples are unavailable, we use the simplified objective ℒ contrastive = − sim + \\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\text{contrastive}}=-\\\\text{sim}_{+} , which directly maximizes the similarity between predictions and targets. This contrastive formulation encourages the model to learn flow representations that capture meaningful structure, improving the agent’s ability to reason about flow dynamics for trajectory planning.\\nFinally, the results of the described approaches are compared with a classical optimization algorithm. This work considers the Zermelo’s navigation algorithm as applied in [ 18 ] ran on the 3D urban environment described in Section Environment of the DRL algorithm. The Zermelo’s optimal navigation problem minimizes a cost functional:\\nsubject to system dynamics, control bounds | u | |u| ≤ \\\\leq u m \\u200b a \\u200b x u_{max} , collision avoidance constraints, and domain boundaries.\\nThe term T f T_{f} represents the final time (mission duration), and its minimization promotes time-efficient flight.\\nThe control effort is penalized by the quadratic term\\nwhere χ \\\\mathbf{\\\\chi} is the control input vector (yaw rate, pitch rate, thrust), and R R is a positive definite weighting matrix. This term ensures smooth and energy-efficient maneuvers by discouraging large control inputs.\\nTo avoid collisions, the cost function includes an obstacle avoidance penalty\\nwhere d i \\u200b ( 𝐱 ) d_{i}(\\\\mathbf{x}) is the distance from the current position 𝐱 \\\\mathbf{x} to the i i -th obstacle, and α i , β i > 0 \\\\alpha_{i},\\\\beta_{i}>0 are tuning parameters that control the strength and sharpness of the penalty.\\nA terminal cost is imposed through\\nwhich penalizes deviations from the desired target position 𝐱 target \\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\text{target}} at the final time T f T_{f} , with κ > 0 \\\\kappa>0 controlling the importance of accurately reaching the target.\\nAll cost components involving control and obstacle penalties are accumulated over the trajectory via the integral\\nwhich ensures that efficiency and safety are maintained throughout the entire mission duration.\\nThe trajectory is parameterized using B-spline basis functions with control points C j C_{j} , transforming the infinite-dimensional optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear programming problem solved by sequential quadratic programming. Collision constraints are enforced through penalty methods using the environment’s geometric obstacle detection, while the flow field influence is incorporated through trilinear interpolation of the discretized velocity data at each trajectory evaluation point.\\nThis comparison is made to enable direct benchmarking between the classical optimization algorithm and DRL-learned policies.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Vision–Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success due to their ability to integrate large-scale multimodal datasets, thereby acquiring semantic grounding and generalizable visual-language (VL) representations (NVIDIA et al., 2025a ; Bai et al., 2025 ; Wang et al., 2025b ; Beyer et al., 2024 ; Driess et al., 2023 ; Awadalla et al., 2023 ) . When exposed to novel visual or linguistic contexts, such models exhibit robust cross-modal understanding and compositional perception – properties that underpin their strong zero and few-shot generalization beyond the training distribution. These advancements have naturally inspired the extension of VLMs toward embodied domains.\\nVision–Language–Action (VLA) models represent a prominent direction in this research trajectory. They adapt pretrained VLMs to action prediction tasks in robotic settings, with the goal of leveraging the semantic priors and cognition abilities inherited from large-scale vision–language pretraining. The underlying hypothesis is that, if appropriately adapted, VLA models can transfer the visual–semantic representations of their initial VLM to the action domain, enabling generalization to previously unseen scenes, instructions, and scenarios. However, in practice, adapting VLMs to the action modality often introduces new challenges. Several recent studies (Pugacheva et al., 2025 ; Driess et al., 2025 ; Liu et al., 2023 ; Mees et al., 2022 ; Chen et al., 2023 ) have shown that current VLA models struggle to maintain generalization in visually and linguistically complex tasks, raising questions about whether strong VL capabilities of VLMs truly transfer to embodied settings. This issue becomes the most evident during task-specific fine-tuning, where limited data diversity and datasets frequently lead to overfitting (Zang et al., 2024 ; Staroverov et al., 2023 ; Ding et al., 2024 ; Pugacheva et al., 2025 ; Cherepanov et al., 2025b ) .\\nDuring large-scale robotic pretraining, recent works have attempted to mitigate this degradation by preserving multimodal understanding capabilities. Prior strategies include incorporating auxiliary reasoning objectives (Chen et al., 2025 ) , applying multimodal co-training on web-scale data (Yang et al., 2025 ) , or freezing pretrained visual–language backbones to preserve VL representations and improve instruction following (NVIDIA et al., 2025b ; Driess et al., 2025 ) . While these approaches help retain vision–language knowledge and improve generalization, they often depend on heavy supervision, high computational cost, or constrained model architecture. Yet, despite these advances at the pretraining stage, there remain no effective methods to address representation degradation during task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) – the critical phase where VLA models must adapt to certain robotic domains without losing their semantic grounding and VL abilities.\\nIn this work, we adopt a realistic VLA deployment setting: starting from a pretrained VLA and adapting it with limited data for supervised fine-tuning in a chosen embodiment and domain. Under these constraints, we conduct a systematic investigation into the degradation of VL representations and multimodal understanding abilities in VLA models and ask a central question: Can we design a simple yet effective method to recover the inherited VL representations during fine-tuning on robotic actions?\\nTo answer this question, we first examined the attention maps and feature activations of the VLA model in comparison to VLM’s across matched image-instruction pairs from the robotics domain.\\nOur analysis of attention maps revealed that: while the pretrained VLM accurately focuses on task-relevant objects, the fine-tuned VLA models often produce diffuse or misplaced activations, failing to attend to key entities under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions ( Figure\\xa04 ).\\nNext, we conducted a t-SNE (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008a ) analysis of intermediate representations across VLM’s and VLA’s layers, which exposed a clear representation collapse (Barbero et al., 2024 ; Arefin et al., 2024 ) in VLA models – indicating that standard action fine-tuning compresses diverse internal features into a narrow representation space, reducing representational diversity and generalization capacity. Next, we propose VL-Think task suite ( section\\xa04 ) to assess transfer of VL knowledge from VLMs to VLA models, benchmark several strong VLMs and compare OpenVLA–7B (Kim et al., 2024 ) to its pretrained base (PrismaticVLM (Karamcheti et al., 2024 ) ). We observe systematic, domain-specific forgetting after action fine-tuning, indicating that VLAs lose VL knowledge about domains absent from the robotics fine-tuning data.\\nTo address this representational degradation, we introduce a lightweight Visual Representation Alignment method inspired by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (Huh et al., 2024 ) .\\nThis hypothesis suggests that large vision and language models tend to converge toward a shared latent representation space that encodes general visual and semantic representations across generalist models. Our method explicitly constrains the visual representations of a VLA to remain aligned with a generalist vision model throughout fine-tuning. By maintaining this link, the VLA preserves semantic consistency while adapting its action policy to new tasks. The method adds negligible computational overhead and integrates seamlessly with SFT ( Figure\\xa02 ). Extensive experiments on different variations of Simpler (Li et al., 2024 ) benchmark demonstrates that this alignment consistently improves out-of-distribution generalization – yielding up to a 10% relative gain over naive SFT ( LABEL:tab:ood_performance ).\\nOur key contributions are as follows:\\nWe systematically demonstrate that naive VLA fine-tuning induces representation collapse and attention sink relative to their initial VLM.\\nWe introduce VL-Think, a diagnostic task suite for assessing transfer of VL knowledge from VLMs across VLA models and show that VLA action fine-tuning lead to domain-specific forgetting.\\nWe propose a simple and efficient visual alignment method that anchors the VLA’s vision representations to strong visual teacher features, preserving multimodal understanding and improving OOD generalization without added complexity ( Figure\\xa02 ).\\nTaken together, our findings provide new insights into the trade-off between action fine-tuning and representation degradation in VLA models. They underscore the importance of maintaining visual-language alignment during fine-tuning and provide a practical recipe for building VLAs that do not “blind” the pretrained perceptual knowledge they rely upon.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Current evaluations of VLA models (Liu et al., 2023 ; Mees et al., 2022 ; Cherepanov et al., 2025a ) primarily emphasize task execution under distribution shifts – such as changes in objects, scenes, recall-based demands or textures but provide little insight into whether the VL capabilities and knowledge inherited from the pretrained VLM are preserved after action fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce the VL-Think Task Suite , a diagnostic suite designed to evaluate the transfer of VL capabilities from VLMs to VLAs independently of their low-level control performance. The suite focuses on testing whether a model continues to understand visual symbols, compositional cues, and categorical distinctions that are commonly evaluated in VLM datasets but underrepresented in robotics domain – rather than whether it can successfully execute grasp or placement actions. We intentionally minimize control complexity to ensure that any observed performance degradation reflects a loss of VL understanding, rather than action execution.\\nTo quantify the gap in VL capabilities, we perform evaluations across both VLA and VLM models.\\nVLA evaluation. The agent observes RGB frames and language instructions. The success rate is recorded if a well-known object is placed on the correct target board. Since motion complexity is fixed, this directly measures the model’s capacity to ground language in visual categories rather than its manipulation skills.\\nVLM evaluation. To assess reasoning in robotics setup without actions, the same scenes are presented as static initial images with the probe: “Do you see the ¡board_name¿?”. Answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’. If yes, specify where: ‘left’, ‘center’, or ‘right’” . A response is counted as successful only if both the predicted board and its target location match the ground truth, yielding a success rate that serves as an action-free measure of semantic grounding.\\nTo reduce the embodiment and setup-specific adaptation bottlenecks, VL-Think Task Suite is based on the realistic Simpler (Li et al., 2024 ) benchmark with WidowX-250S arm pick-and-place task. Each episode spawns a single source well-known object (carrot) positioned to yield 100% grasp reliability and multiple planar “boards” textured with abstract categories (e.g., icons, shapes, numerals). A language instruction specifies a single target concept (shape, color, icon class, direction, or parity). The agent succeeds if it places the carrot on the board that matches the instructed concept. By keeping the objects and action complexity fixed, the evaluation isolates VL skills while bounding execution complexity.\\nThe VL-Think suite consists of eight board-selection tasks that probe different aspects of knowledge (see Figure 3 ). In each task, the agent must place the object on the board that matches the instructed concept: Shape – the board whose graphic is the named geometric shape; e.g., “Put the object on the star.”), Color – the board whose shape has the named color; e.g., “Put the object on the blue shape”, Traffic – the board depicting one of 24 common traffic signs; e.g., “the yield sign”, Laundry care – the board depicting one of 17 standard laundry symbols, e.g., “Do not bleach”, Weather – the board depicting one of 9 common weather icons; e.g., “sunny”, “cloudy”, Directional arrow – the board whose arrow points in the named direction: “up”, “down”, “left”, “right”, Public information – the board depicting one of 14 public-information signs; e.g., “no dogs allowed”, and Numeral parity – the board whose printed numeral matches the requested parity (“odd” or “even”); e.g., “Put the object on the odd number”.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'In this section, we ask: what happens to VL representations and knowledge in VLA models after action fine-tuning? Does knowledge transfer from VLMs actually occur, and is strong semantic grounding retained?\\nTo examine how strongly VL representations degrade in VLA models, we conduct complementary analyses. First, we use t-SNE (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008b ) visualization to assess whether the model preserves a structured and separable latent space for instruction-related tokens. Second, we analyze attention maps to evaluate how accurately the model focuses on objects referenced in the input instruction. Finally, using the VL-Think suite, we assess the transferability of VLM VL skills to VLA policies. Together, these methods provide intuitive and interpretable diagnostics of VL representation degradation and domain forgetting – revealing whether the model maintains focused visual grounding, coherent latent organization and erodes domain-specific knowledge after action fine-tuning.\\nTo further investigate how fine-tuning affects the VL grounding capabilities of VLA models, we examine their attention maps, which reveal how effectively the model focuses on the object referenced in a textual instruction. This analysis provides a direct probe into how well the model maintains connection between visual and language features. For each model, we visualize the attention maps for visual patch embeddings from the middle layers. Following prior studies (Zhang et al., 2025 ) , we observe ( Figure\\xa04 ) that the strongest and most semantically meaningful attention patterns typically emerge in the middle transformer layers (layers 14–24), where vision–language fusion is the most active.\\nAmong the evaluated models, Qwen2.5-VL exhibits clear and relevant object-aligned attention, indicating that its attention is precisely localized on the queried object with minimal spatial noise. In contrast, OpenVLA displays substantial degradation in attention quality: the maps become diffuse, noisy, and weakly correlated with the target object indicating attention sink (Kang et al., 2025 ; Lin et al., 2025a ) . Instead of concentrating on relevant image regions, the OpenVLA’s attention maps frequently leak into irrelevant background regions or concentrate on distractor objects (for more results see subsection\\xa0A.2 ). By contrast, our proposed Visual Representation Alignment approach remedies this issue: OpenVLA (Align) trained with it produces crisp, object-centric attention maps (see subsection\\xa0A.2 for details).\\nTo analyze how action fine-tuning affects the internal VL representations of VLA models, we conducted a t-SNE representation probe comparing Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025 ) , PrismaticVLM (Karamcheti et al., 2024 ) , and OpenVLA (Kim et al., 2024 ) . This experiment provides a qualitative view of how the semantic structure in the latent space evolves through the action training process. We use the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014 ) and select samples from three common household object classes: cup, bottle, and knife. For each image, the model receives a textual query of the form “Do you see ¡object_name¿?” . Then we extract the embedding corresponding to the token ¡object_name¿ from transformer layers and then project these embeddings into two dimensions using the t-SNE algorithm. Each point in the visualization is color-coded by its object class, allowing us to observe how distinct or entangled the category clusters become.\\nFigure\\xa05 illustrates this comparison for the middle layers, revealing how the latent space is organized across the different model’s layers. In the PrismaticVLM and Qwen2.5-VL, embeddings for the three categories form well-separated clusters reflecting a coherent and semantically organized latent space typical of large-scale VLMs. In contrast, OpenVLA exhibits blurred and overlapping clusters, indicating that fine-tuning for robot control disrupts the structured organization of its inherited representations. This loss of separability corresponds to a phenomenon akin to representation collapse (Barbero et al., 2024 ; Arefin et al., 2024 ) , where previously distinct VL representations converge into less discriminative subspaces.\\nUsing the VL-Think task suite ( section\\xa04 ), we evaluate VL capabilities across several state-of-the-art VLMs: InternVL3.5 (Wang et al., 2025b ) , Ovis2.5 (Lu et al., 2025 ) , Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025 ) and focus on OpenVLA–7B (Kim et al., 2024 ) versus its pretrained base PrismaticVLM (Karamcheti et al., 2024 ) , which we use as an approximate upper bound. This comparison probes how much VL knowledge and semantic grounding skills persist after action fine-tuning.\\nTwo clear trends emerge. First, strong VLMs achieve high success rate across all domains, reflecting robust semantic grounding. Second, action fine-tuning induces systematic, domain-specific forgetting in VLA models: relative to its pretrained counterpart, OpenVLA–7B exhibits substantial drops in nearly all domains, with the largest declines in symbolic and abstract categories (traffic, arrows, public information, weather). We hypothesize that VLA models lose knowledge about domains that are absent in robotics fine-tuning datasets.

This result underscores the effectiveness of visual representation alignment in enhancing robustness to visual shifts, text instruction variations, texture changes, and background perturbations that frequently occur in real-world scenarios. The improvement indicates that aligning internal visual-language embeddings not only stabilizes perception but also reinforces the semantic grounding. Conversely, the Freeze baseline completely fails across all categories (as also observed in (Wang et al., 2025a ) ), yielding near-zero performance. This confirms that simply freezing the pretrained visual encoder does not preserve useful representations during adaptation. Without joint optimization, the frozen features become mismatched with the evolving action components, leading to severe degradation of both perception and control.\\nOverall, these results validate that visual alignment serves as an effective regularizer against representation degradation, allowing the model to recover general-purpose visual semantics while adapting to new robotic environments.\\nTo further evaluate the representational quality learned by our model, we conduct a linear probing analysis on the ImageNet-100 dataset (Tian et al., 2020 ) . Specifically, we extract patch embeddings from the final layer of the C-RADIOv3 (Heinrich et al., 2025 ) teacher and from the intermediate visual layers of different OpenVLA variants. Following standard practice in representation learning (Yu et al., 2025 ; Huh et al., 2024 ) , we freeze the visual encoders and train a single linear classifier on top of their frozen features to measure the separability of semantic categories. This setup directly quantifies how linearly decodable the visual features remain after action fine-tuning.\\nThe results summarized in Table\\xa03 reveal several consistent trends. As expected, the C-RADIOv3 teacher achieves the highest probing accuracy, reflecting its strong pretrained representations. Among the VLA variants, the OpenVLA fine-tuned with our proposed Visual Representation Alignment method outperforms both the pretrained checkpoint and the model fine-tuned with naive SFT. This improvement indicates that our alignment strategy effectively enhances the VLA’s representations during action fine-tuning. In contrast, naive SFT substantially reduces probing accuracy relative to the pretrained model, confirming that standard fine-tuning harms representational quality. Our aligned model not only mitigates this degradation but surpasses the pretrained baseline, indicating that the alignment loss strengthens semantic consistency and leads to more transferable visual features.\\nFollowing the experiments in subsection\\xa05.3 , we evaluate of OpenVLA fine-tuned with our proposed visual representation alignment method (OpenVLA-7B Align), under identical data, budget, and evaluation settings. Results in Table\\xa02 show that SFT-Align partially mitigates domain forgetting observed under default SFT. In particular, performance on Color and Shape domains consistently improves even surpassing the PrismaticVLM upper bound, but leaving other domains mostly unchanged.\\nThese outcomes highlight both the promise and limits of the proposed representation alignment under constrained settings. We hypothesize that the modest size and diversity of the SFT dataset and the limited expressivity of LoRA updates are insufficient to restore less frequent VL concepts that are underrepresented in robotics data. We hypothesize that expanding data breadth and relaxing parameter-efficiency constraints will unlock broader gains beyond commonly represented domains. Verifying this hypothesis is an important direction for future work.',\n",

Without joint optimization, the frozen features become mismatched with the evolving action components, leading to severe degradation of both perception and control.\\nOverall, these results validate that visual alignment serves as an effective regularizer against representation degradation, allowing the model to recover general-purpose visual semantics while adapting to new robotic environments.',\n",

Specifically, we extract patch embeddings from the final layer of the C-RADIOv3 (Heinrich et al., 2025 ) teacher and from the intermediate visual layers of different OpenVLA variants. Following standard practice in representation learning (Yu et al., 2025 ; Huh et al., 2024 ) , we freeze the visual encoders and train a single linear classifier on top of their frozen features to measure the separability of semantic categories. This setup directly quantifies how linearly decodable the visual features remain after action fine-tuning.\\nThe results summarized in Table\\xa03 reveal several consistent trends. As expected, the C-RADIOv3 teacher achieves the highest probing accuracy, reflecting its strong pretrained representations. Among the VLA variants, the OpenVLA fine-tuned with our proposed Visual Representation Alignment method outperforms both the pretrained checkpoint and the model fine-tuned with naive SFT. This improvement indicates that our alignment strategy effectively enhances the VLA’s representations during action fine-tuning. In contrast, naive SFT substantially reduces probing accuracy relative to the pretrained model, confirming that standard fine-tuning harms representational quality. Our aligned model not only mitigates this degradation but surpasses the pretrained baseline, indicating that the alignment loss strengthens semantic consistency and leads to more transferable visual features.',\n",

We hypothesize that the modest size and diversity of the SFT dataset and the limited expressivity of LoRA updates are insufficient to restore less frequent VL concepts that are underrepresented in robotics data.

Yet when these VLMs are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning, showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA’s hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together, our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to recover inherited VL capabilities.

       "    'paragraphs': 'If machine learning mirrors human cognition to learn, can machine unlearning similarly reflect how knowledge is forgotten? Lake et\\xa0al. ( 2017 ) Unlearning has recently emerged as a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs), especially as these systems increasingly memorize personally identifiable information, propagate outdated facts, or retain knowledge that developers may wish to remove Carlini et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ); Tirumala et\\xa0al. ( 2022 ); Xuan and Li ( 2025 ); Lukas et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ); Karamolegkou et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ); Chang et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ) . However, removing information may leave traces, activate related associations, or cause unexpected side effects like hallucinations Xu et\\xa0al. ( 2023a ); Maini et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) .\\nThis challenge stems from the entangled nature of knowledge representations in LLMs Liu et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ); Zhang et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ) , much like the interconnected networks described in cognitive theories of human memory. Hebbian theory shows that \"neurons that fire together, wire together\" Hebb ( 1949 ) ; co-activated concepts form strengthened associations that resist targeted erasure. Understanding knowledge entanglement is therefore critical because it reveals how information is represented, stored, and retrieved within LLMs. Just as human memories are embedded in dense neural networks where concepts mutually reinforce each other through repeated co-activation, LLM knowledge may similarly distribute across overlapping parameter spaces, making surgical removal impossible without disrupting adjacent representations. These organizational patterns determine whether information can be truly erased, with implications for privacy protection, harm prevention, and regulatory compliance with data protection laws such as the GDPR’s Right to Be Forgotten Voigt and Von\\xa0dem Bussche ( 2017 ) . Toward this goal of evaluating unlearned model behavior, we investigate whether knowledge entanglement metrics can predict unlearning robustness under persuasive framing attacks. Our framework tests the hypothesis that densely interconnected concepts resist unlearning because closely linked, frequently co-activated Hebb ( 1949 ); Anderson ( 1983 ) associations create multiple retrieval pathways that rhetorical strategies can exploit.\\nRecent work has shown that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with factual knowledge, particularly for less popular (tail) entities, with GPT-4 achieving only a 31% accuracy on comprehensive factual QA benchmarks Sun et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ) . This factuality gap becomes even more critical in the unlearning context: if models do not successfully retain knowledge even during normal training, how can we verify that targeted unlearning has successfully removed specific information? Our work extends this line of inquiry by investigating not only whether knowledge persists after unlearning, but how its entanglement structure and retrieval mechanisms determine what remains accessible under different prompt framings.\\nEvaluating unlearning robustness requires understanding how knowledge structure and prompt delivery interact. Figure 1 illustrates our framework’s core hypothesis: unlearned LLM behavior depends on both the semantic entanglement of target knowledge and the rhetorical framing used to elicit it. Drawing inspiration from the Obliviate charm in Harry Potter , a spell that removes specific memories but often leaves traces depending on the caster’s skill, and from the selective memory erasure depicted in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , we investigate whether LLMs show similar vulnerabilities when forgotten knowledge is probed through different rhetorical strategies. Given LLMs’ structural resemblance to human cognitive processing through attention mechanisms Zheng et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) and their demonstrated alignment with human behavioral patterns Binz and Schulz ( 2023 ) , are LLMs more susceptible to emotional and authority appeals (mirroring human psychological manipulation) or logical reasoning (reflecting their computational nature)?\\nAlthough recent work has investigated unlearning robustness in LLMs through adversarial optimization Carlini et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ); Xuan and Li ( 2025 ); To and Le ( 2025 ) and jailbreaking techniques Zeng et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ); Chao et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ); Xu et\\xa0al. ( 2023b ) , these approaches focus primarily on what information is requested but neglect two critical dimensions: (1) the structural entanglement of knowledge and (2) the communicative delivery of prompts. Therefore, we propose the Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework ( SKeB ), which synthesizes spreading activation theories from cognitive science (ACT-R and Hebbian) with communication principles to comprehensively evaluate how knowledge entanglement and persuasive framing interact to bypass unlearning. Our contributions are summarized as follows :\\nWe introduce SKeB , a theory-grounded framework investigating unlearning robustness through the interaction of semantic entanglement (what can be activated) and persuasive framing (what will be activated).\\nWe develop nine graph-based entanglement metrics and show that distance-weighted influence ( ℳ 9 \\\\mathcal{M}_{9} ) strongly predicts factual recall ( r = 0.77 r=0.77 ), with authority framing producing 9.3× higher entanglement activation.\\nWe reveal persuasive framing effectiveness negatively correlates with model size ( r = − 0.89 r=-0.89 ): smaller models show 128% factual recall increases versus 15% for larger models.\\nOur framework enables a predictive model explaining 78% of variance in unlearning robustness, allowing us to filter queries susceptible for knowledge leakage in unlearned LLMs.',\n",

We use the Harry Potter domain ( 𝒯 \\\\mathcal{T} ), a popular domain that is often tested in unlearning LLM literature, with 300 base prompts designed to elicit domain-specific knowledge Eldan and Russinovich ( 2023 ) . Each prompt was transformed using gpt-4 into three persuasive variants applying emotional appeal, logical reasoning, and authority endorsement framing, yielding 1,200 total prompts.\\nModels.

An ensemble of three judge models (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-5-nano) classified each response along three dimensions: factual recall (correct Harry Potter information), non-factual (plausible but incorrect), and hallucination (fabricated content). For instance, an 80% factual recall means that 80% of the output was considered by the judge models to be factual. Scores were averaged across judges, with gpt-5-mini resolving borderline cases where judges disagreed.\\nDomain Graph Construction. We constructed a co-occurrence domain graph from all seven Harry Potter books, resulting in 1,296 entities (characters, locations, objects, events) connected by 35,922 edges weighted by chapter co-occurrence (Figure 3 ).

       "    'paragraphs': 'RQ1. Persuasive Framings Systematically Alter Entanglement Patterns. Authority prompts activate nodes with 9.3× higher distance-weighted entanglement scores compared to base prompts. Metric 9 (distance-weighted influence) shows a strong variation across stimulus types, capturing how activation strength decreases across each graph hop. This validates that persuasive transformations systematically alter the entanglement structure of activated knowledge. Figure 5 shows that different framings don’t just change surface form, they fundamentally shift which semantic pathways are engaged in the domain graph.\\nRQ2. Entanglement is Positively Correlated with Factual Recall in Unlearned Models. Figure 4 shows that high knowledge entanglement, as measured by our graph-based metrics ℳ i \\\\mathcal{M}_{i} , positively correlates with factual recall in supposedly unlearned models. We observed that authority prompts lead to a 52% average factual recall improvement across all models (Pearson r = 0.77 r{=}0.77 , p < 0.001 p{<}0.001 ). This supports the spreading activation hypothesis: the more entangled the information activated by a prompt, the greater the resulting factual recall. ℳ 9 \\\\mathcal{M}_{9} metric (distance-weighted influence) (Figure 4 ) emerges as the strongest predictor, aligning with the spreading activation theories’ predictions that closely connected concepts in semantic memory activate each other more reliably than distant concepts. Noticeably, Table 3 shows that knowledge entanglement observes a consistent trend in strengthening correlations with an LLM’s behavior after it is unlearned.\\nRQ3. Emotional Framing Suppresses Hallucination. Figure 7 shows that while emotional prompts produce the lowest factuality (3.12% average), they also suppress hallucination rates better than other persuasive techniques.\\nLogical reasoning prompts provide structured context that stabilizes recall, achieving the best factuality-to-hallucination ratio (4.95:1), suggesting logical framing not only facilitates retrieval but also constrains generation to semantically factual outputs.\\nEmotional prompts, while suppressive of factuality, also suppress hallucination (4.4% vs. 11.6% for authority), indicating an almost \"safety-aligned\" response mode where models recognize emotional manipulation and respond conservatively.\\nAuthority prompts achieve high factuality but moderate hallucination (11.6%), showing a precision-recall tradeoff where broader activation of knowledge pathways sometimes triggers adjacent but incorrect associations.\\nWe also find that model size inversely correlates with persuasive technique effectiveness. As illustrated in Figure 6 , factual knowledge recall effectiveness shows an inverse relationship with model size ( r = − 0.926 r=-0.926 ). Across all models, this relationship is significant, with an average Pearson correlation of r = − 0.89 r=-0.89 ( p < 0.01 p<0.01 ). We notice that smaller models show 91-128% factual recall increases under authority framing, while the 13B model shows only 15% increase. This suggests that larger models develop more robust suppression mechanisms that are resistant to these persuasive techniques, but still, all models remain vulnerable to some degree. Unlearned smaller models should be considered much more vulnerable to persuasive attacks, while larger models, though more resistant, cannot be assumed to be completely safe.\\nRQ4. SKeB Enables Predictive Modeling of Unlearning Robustness. We constructed separate logistic regression models to predict factual, non-factual, and hallucinated recall in unlearned models using an 80/20 train-test split and find the best ℳ \\\\mathcal{M} metric as the predictor for each one-versus-all prediction probability p p of \"factual\", \"non-factual\" and \"hallucination\" behaviors in LLMs’ responses.\\nTable 4 presents the complete statistical analysis of the entanglement scores corresponding to metrics ℳ 9 \\\\mathcal{M}_{9} , ℳ 4 \\\\mathcal{M}_{4} , and ℳ 3 \\\\mathcal{M}_{3} , for each prompt type under consideration. These metrics were specifically selected as the strongest predictors for their respective content types. The non-factual model shows highly statistically significant coefficients ( p < 0.001 p{<}0.001 , 86.4% test accuracy) with ℳ 4 \\\\mathcal{M}_{4} negatively correlating with non-factual content, while the hallucination model ( p < 0.002 p{<}0.002 , 97.0% test accuracy) shows ℳ 3 \\\\mathcal{M}_{3} positively correlating with hallucinated output. The factual model shows marginally significant results ( p = 0.065 p=0.065 , 96.2% test accuracy) with ℳ 9 \\\\mathcal{M}_{9} positively correlating with factual recall. Given a prompt type (original, emotional, logical, authority), we map it to its corresponding metric values ( ℳ 9 \\\\mathcal{M}_{9} , ℳ 4 \\\\mathcal{M}_{4} , ℳ 3 \\\\mathcal{M}_{3} ) and compute expected percentages. This allows estimating the model’s susceptibility to factual leakage, non-factual generation, or hallucinations based on entanglement structure and prompt framing.\\nRQ5. Architectural Differences Reveal Unlearning Mechanisms Correlation Patterns. We found that different architectures show distinct correlation changes after unlearning. LLaMA-2-7B’s Metric 2 correlation shrinks from 0.837 (base) to -0.017 (unlearned), indicating genuine knowledge pathway disruption rather than output suppression. Additionally, LLaMA-2-7B uniquely shows strong positive correlations between all entanglement metrics ( ℳ 1 \\\\mathcal{M}_{1} - ℳ 9 \\\\mathcal{M}_{9} ) and hallucination rates, suggesting that this model’s unlearning process may inadvertently create conditions where entangled knowledge pathways also trigger hallucinated outputs. In contrast, OPT-2.7B retains strong correlations (0.56-0.93 across metrics), suggesting intact knowledge structures with modified thresholds of accessibility. LLaMA-3.1-8B and LLaMA-2-13B show intermediate patterns (shown in Table 3 ). This variation implies unlearning robustness depends on both parameter count and knowledge encoding architecture.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'Authority Prompts and the Psychology of Persuasion. We observe that authority endorsement produces the highest factual recall (25.42% on average) and also has the most entangled prompts on average. This aligns with Cialdini’s work which claims that humans comply with authority figures even when requests conflict with their beliefs Cialdini ( 1993 ) . LLMs exhibit analogous vulnerability: authority-framed requests override unlearning-based suppression mechanisms. This parallel, which appears across all tested LLM architectures, raises an interesting discussion about whether LLMs learn semantic representations mirroring human psychology or merely reproduce statistical patterns encoding psychological biases.\\nMessage = Delivery + Content: The Interrogation Parallel. The stark contrast where identical prompts yield 3.12% factuality under emotional versus 25.42% under authority framing demonstrates that knowledge retrieval effectiveness of LLMs depends critically on stimulus or delivery, not just content . While this claim provides a strong basis for the existing popularity of prompt engineering, it also parallels criminal interrogation psychology where the Reid Technique Inbau et\\xa0al. ( 2013 ) and PEACE model Davison ( 2016 ) show that framing dramatically affects recall: confrontational approaches produce resistance while rapport-building increases disclosure. Metric ℳ 9 \\\\mathcal{M}_{9} captures this strongly: authority prompts create 9.3× more activation pathways, routing around suppression like interrogators bypass psychological resistance.\\nThe Size-Vulnerability Paradox. The negative correlation between model size and factual knowledge recall using persuasive techniques (r = -0.89) reveals that larger models resist manipulation better. For instance, OPT-2.7B exhibits 128.4% factual knowledge recall gain versus LLaMA-2-13B’s 14.7%. We hypothesize that larger models appear to recognize when social framing elicits suppressed information, while smaller models treat re-framed queries as categorically different. However, resistance is incomplete: even the 13B model shows 14.7% increase, indicating that while larger models raise activation thresholds, underlying knowledge representations remain intact and accessible Xu et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ) .\\nImplications for AI Safety. The tested unlearning method allows for substantial factual recall, with OPT-2.7B showing 128% gain through rhetorical reframing versus 14.7% for larger models; scaling alone provides incomplete protection. Our SKeB framework offers practical tools: Metric 9 ’s correlation with leakage ( r = 0.77 r=0.77 ) enables filtering high-risk queries in deployment. Post-unlearning correlation persistence (Table 3 ) indicates knowledge survives in distributed form, suggesting robust unlearning requires architectural innovations rather than weight adjustments. Higher entanglement also increases hallucination risk ( r = 0.36 r=0.36 ), as densely connected regions trigger semantically distant associations.',\n",

( 2023 ) demonstrated that LLM factuality degrades systematically from head to tail entities, with performance declining as entity popularity decreases. Their Head-to-Tail benchmark showed that increase in model size does not automatically improve retention of factual knowledge. We extend this by (1) investigating whether unlearning successfully removes knowledge or simply suppresses it, (2) providing mechanistic explanations through entanglement metrics for their observed head-to-tail gradient, and (3) demonstrating that persuasive framing recovers 50-128% more content than direct queries. This reveals that static factuality assessments underestimate knowledge retention in both base and unlearned models.\\nExisting works often describe the robustness of machine unlearning in LLMs as an adversarial attack optimization problem. They show that strategically crafted queries can retrieve personally identifiable information from LLM training data Carlini et\\xa0al. ( 2023 ); To and Le ( 2025 ) , or adversarial queries can expose latent memories despite unlearning attempts Xuan and Li ( 2025 ) . Although these works have successfully revealed that unlearning often only achieves surface level forgetting Xu et\\xa0al. ( 2025 ) , they did not investigate how this would change when input queries are presented to LLMs in different rhetorical framings , or how the message is delivered. Rhetorical framing has emerged as a critical tool for vulnerability analysis in LLMs. For example, persuasive jailbreak prompts using emotional appeals and moral reasoning have been used to extract restricted information Zeng et\\xa0al. ( 2024 ) , and persuasive conversations can coax models to defend misinformation Xu et\\xa0al. ( 2023b ) . However, no prior work systematically investigates how persuasive framing interacts with unlearning robustness. Most importantly, similar to adversarial attack-related works, there has been little effort in deriving theories grounded on how rhetorical framing systemically influences how LLMs perceive a query to recall knowledge, leading to varying behaviors.\\nTherefore, our SKeB framework, which adopts the modeling of memory retrieval as activation propagating through semantic networks of entangled knowledge, provides a more systematic way to understand unlearning behaviors in LLMs. Existing literature also backs up SKeB ’s intuition, including demonstration that gpt-3 behavior aligns with human cognitive patterns Binz and Schulz ( 2023 ) or LLMs exhibit human-like priming effects and sensory judgments while they fundamentally differ in conceptual stability Niu et\\xa0al.

       "    'paragraphs': 'While our work establishes important connections between cognitive theories and machine unlearning, we acknowledge limitations that contextualize our contributions. Our experiments focus on the Harry Potter universe, where ground truth is well-defined and ethically unproblematic to probe. Whether out findings generalize to more sensitive domains (PII, harmful content, copyrighted material) remains an open research direction, as fictional knowledge may be encoded differently than factual/personal information. We evaluate only four models ranging from 2.7B to 13B parameters; larger models (70B+) and different architectures (Mistral, Gemma, Claude) may exhibit different vulnerability patterns. The inverse size-vulnerability relationship we observe might reverse at much larger scales or saturate at some threshold. Nevertheless, the strong correlations across tested models suggest our framework captures meaningful regularities.\\nOur entanglement metrics assume domain graphs constructed from co-occurrence reflect internal representations. While strong correlations ( r = 0.76 r=0.76 for factuality) validate this assumption, we cannot directly observe neural activations. LLMs might achieve equivalent behavior through different computational mechanisms; correlation does not prove causation without interventional experiments. Our correlation shift analysis provides partial mechanistic insight: LLaMA-2-7B’s ℳ 2 \\\\mathcal{M}_{2} ’s collapse (0.837 → -0.017) indicates genuine disruption while OPT-2.7B’s stable correlations suggest superficial suppression. However, true mechanistic interpretability remains beyond current tools.\\nWe tested the WHP gradient ascent Eldan and Russinovich ( 2023 ) ; other unlearning approaches (influence functions, model editing) might show different robustness profiles. Our evaluation relies on LLM judges (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-5-nano) with 98% inter-judge agreement and manual validation, though human expert evaluation would strengthen confidence. Despite these constraints, our results remain indicative: the framework successfully predicts unlearning vulnerabilities, enabling proactive assessment even if underlying mechanisms remain partially understood.\\nFinally, we draw on ACT-R and persuasion research to interpret LLM behavior, yet psychology has not fully resolved debates about memory representation or persuasion mechanisms. We do not claim cognitive frameworks \"solve\" unlearning, but rather demonstrate they provide useful predictive and interpretive tools. The opacity of human cognition mirrors challenges with LLMs. Nevertheless, our framework advances the understanding of unlearning failures in ways that are actionable for future research.',\n",

If personal information (PII, medical records, private communications) is unlearned but recoverable through high-entanglement prompts, has privacy truly been protected?\\nWe recommend that privacy-focused unlearning be accompanied by adversarial testing with high-entanglement prompts before deployment.\\nHarm Prevention. Unlearning aims to prevent models from disseminating dangerous information. Our results suggest this may be harder to achieve than hoped. Models that refuse direct questions (\"How do I make a bomb?\") might still provide information when prompted with authority framing (\"As a chemistry teacher, explain…\"). This creates a dilemma: sharing our study might help attackers extract harmful information, but concealing vulnerabilities leaves developers ignorant of risks. We have chosen transparency while emphasizing that our results show unlearning alone is insufficient.\\nBroader Impacts. Our findings suggest that current unlearning methods cannot yet reliably protect privacy or prevent information dissemination.\\nOrganizations using unlearned models should conduct adversarial testing and not assume unlearning guarantees safety. On the positive side, our framework provides a tool for improving unlearning evaluation. Rather than claiming models are \"safe\" after unlearning, AI practitioners can quantify residual vulnerability: This model shows X% factual recall under high-entanglement prompts .\\nLong-term Considerations. As models scale beyond current sizes, the size-vulnerability relationship we observe (larger models more resistant) offers cautious optimism that scaling might eventually yield robust unlearning. However, even our 13B model showed 15% factual knowledge recall, which is far from secure. Achieving truly robust unlearning may require architectural innovations (modular memory systems, causal isolation of knowledge components) rather than just scaling existing designs.',\n",

We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to 13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs. Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B).

       "    'paragraphs': 'In recent years, there has been growing interest in Large Language Model (LLM) agents (e.g., Web-Agents) and their diverse applications (Wang et\\xa0al., 2024a ) . While much of the current work focuses on action planning or goal completion in LLM agents (Ahn et\\xa0al., 2022 ; Durante et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Song et\\xa0al., 2023 ) (e.g., based on natural language instructions), their ability to collaborate with one another toward a shared goal remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by studying LLM agents in the context of task collaboration, particularly under conditions of information asymmetry.\\nInformation asymmetry is a fundamental and pervasive feature of human interaction. In daily life, we often possess different knowledge, perspectives, or intention. We must reason about others’ knowledge and beliefs and coordinate our differences in order to collaborate (Ma et\\xa0al., 2023 ) . As LLM agents become increasingly integrated into real-world workflows — not just to perform tasks independently, but to act as human proxies and collaborators — it becomes essential to examine how well these agents can coordinate under asymmetric information, and what mechanisms might enhance their collaborative capabilities in such settings.\\nTo this end, we adapt Einstein Puzzles (Groza, 2021 ) , a classical logic problem, into a tabletop environment where two agents must solve spatial and relational constraints, despite having partial, asymmetric information. Using a fine-tuning–plus–verifier framework, we equip LLM agents with different communicative abilities (e.g., asking, sharing, or both) and study their collaborative behaviors under various configurations.\\nFurthermore, we introduce an environment-based verifier to guide and evaluate agent decisions. This verifier leverages environmental signals to determine whether the proposed actions and known constraints are consistent, mirroring the implicit feedback mechanisms in interactive test-and-trials. It is training-free, lightweight, and broadly applicable across various environments. We examine whether this simple yet generalizable approach can greatly improve collaboration among LLM agents.\\nOur empirical results have shown that under information asymmetry, LLM agents with both information-seeking and -providing capabilities collaborate most effectively. Meanwhile, mismatched agent communicative abilities leads to significant performance degradation, highlighting the importance of aligned interaction protocols. Additionally, through detailed error analysis, we show that environment-based verification, using naturally available feedback without additional training, offers a simple but powerful mechanism to improve agent performance on both task completion and understanding. Finally, our human study reveals a gap between task efficiency and human preference: participants favor agents that proactively share information, even if such agents are less optimal in task completion. These findings indicate the need for communication-aware and interpretable design in LLM-based collaborative systems.',\n",

We refer readers to (Guan et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Zhang et\\xa0al., 2025 ) for comprehensive reviews of verification-based methods.\\nWhile most existing approaches employ a separate value model, often another LLM, with (Lifshitz et\\xa0al., 2025 ; Lightman et\\xa0al., 2023 ; McAleese et\\xa0al., 2024 ; Wang et\\xa0al., 2025 , 2024b ; Zhang et\\xa0al., 2024b ; Zhou et\\xa0al., 2024a ) or without (Yao et\\xa0al., 2023 ; Yu et\\xa0al., 2023 ) further training, we propose an alternative verification mechanism that directly leverages environmental feedback. In interactive tasks within simulated environments, the environment itself provides fine-grained, up-to-date, and objective signals about task progression and action validity. This enables a training-free, compute-efficient form of verification that naturally integrates with agent decision-making.',\n",

We modify it into a collaborative game in which two agents work together to place a set of objects into designated bins. Each object has a target bin as its destination, but the information about these destinations is split between the two agents. Importantly, agents are unaware of which pieces of information their partner possesses. To succeed, agents must engage in rich communication and apply strategic reasoning to solve the task collaboratively.\\nThe setup consists of a rectangular table with two collaborators sitting on opposite sides of the table (See Figure 1 ). The table is split into three regions: a region immediately in front of each collaborator and a common area in the center. Each collaborator can only reach the area directly in front of them and the common area in the center. They can also each reach the two corner bins on either side of the area in front of them, totaling four destination bins. In the beginning, several objects are distributed between the two players’ bins, so they are exclusively reachable by one of the collaborators. No objects start in any bins.\\nWe describe the task as a distributed constraint satisfaction problem. A goal configuration is defined, which is where the objects should be placed, and can be described with a set of constraints. There are four types of constraints that describe the relationship of a pair of objects or between an object and a bin. Given a pair of objects, it must either be:\\nin the same bin : both objects have the same destination.\\nin the same column : the two objects must end up in bins on either exclusive side of the table but on the same side, left or right, from either collaborator’s perspective.\\nin the same row : both objects must end up on one of the collaborator’s exclusive zones but in bins on opposite sides, left or right.\\nor on the same diagonal : the two objects must end up in opposite areas and opposite sides.\\nThe exhaustive set of rules between all pairs of objects is overly descriptive. We select a random, minimal subset of these rules (denoted as 𝒞 \\\\mathcal{C} ). A minimal subset 𝒞 \\\\mathcal{C} must satisfy the following:\\nEliminating any rule will describe more than one final configuration.\\nMoving any object from the final configuration will violate at least one rule.\\nAn additional starting constraint is given, which grounds one of the objects to a specific bin.

A move can be placing an object into an available destination bin or the center of the table, sharing a piece of information, or requesting information from their partner. Task performance is measured by the number of moves taken to complete the task. Since both object placement and information exchange count as a move, this scoring system encourages players to communicate concisely. The players’ objective is to achieve the final configuration using the least number of moves within the set of given constraints.\\nWe study two communicative actions in collaborative contexts with information asymmetry: information seeking and information providing. We want to investigate whether LLM agents are able to exchange necessary information with their partners, as well as perform collaborative reasoning for task completion. To systematically analyze the role of communication actions in this process, we design four action space configurations for communication as below:\\nInformation Providing Only: agents are allowed to proactively share their knowledge of constraints with their partners, but they cannot ask for this information.\\nInformation Seeking Only: agents can ask about constraints of specific objects with their partners. They are allowed to share a constraint only when their partner first asks about a object involved in it.

Rather than training a dedicated verifier, we directly leverage environment-provided feedback as a source of verification during inference.\\nWe evaluate whether this lightweight, training-free approach is sufficient to support LLM agents in collaborative reasoning tasks under information asymmetry.\\nWe design a reasoning verifier based on environment feedback. Firstly, It is capable to examine the generated action with the game rules (e.g. physical affordance) and previous communication (e.g. redundant information sharing). Secondly, as a strategy-driven game, we implement a graph expansion algorithm to enhance agents’ reasoning ability. It treats objects and bins as nodes and constraints as edges, and infers new constraints by combining existing ones. It is expanded iteratively using the transitivity of adjacent edges until no new constraints emerge. For example, objects A and C can be inferred to be on the same row if both A and B , and B and C , are known to be on the same row.\\nThis enables the verifier to assess whether a proposed action aligns well with the current knowledge, and avoids unnecessary trials.\\nFurther, we tested several alternatives of environment-based verifiers, and discussed their effectiveness and potential generality in Appendix C .',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of language models in reasoning and communication under information asymmetry. Our experiments address four key research questions:\\nRQ1: Collaboration under Varying Communicative Action Space. How do agents collaborate under information asymmetry when equipped with different communicative actions?\\nRQ2: Effectiveness of Environment-Based Verification. To what extent can environment-based verification enhance the performance?\\nRQ3: Collaboration under Mismatched Communicative Action Space. What happens when agents with mismatched communication capabilities are paired together?\\nRQ4: Human Preferences Toward Different Communication Behaviors. While agents may perform well in self-play, do these behaviors align with human preferences in collaboration?\\nTo systematically investigate our research questions, we design a series of experiments to investigate specific aspects of the collaboration:\\nExp1: Collaboration with Different Communicative Action Spaces (RQ1) We evaluated both closed-source language models via API calls and open-source models with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We deploy the same model (with the same action space) to perform self-play in the game. This setting allows direct comparison of collaboration with different communicative action space.\\nExp2: Environment-Based Verifier (RQ2) We augment the base models with an environment-based verifier, which provides binary feedback indicating whether each sampled action is valid. At each decision step, we sample 4 candidate responses using temperature=0.2 and top-p=0.9 , and apply the verifier to filter out invalid actions, selecting the first valid one as the final output. This setup enables a direct comparison of model performance with and without the verifier.\\nExp3: Collaboration with Mismatched Action Spaces (RQ3) We select the well-performing models from those action spaces (Llama3.1-8B without CoT for no information exchange , and Llama3.1-8B with CoT for the rest), equipped with reasoning verifier, and let them play with each other. This setting further reveals the behaviors of collaboration between agents with different communication capabilities.\\nExp4: Human Performance (RQ4) Once we identified the most effective configuration of communicative action space for collaborative reasoning among LLM agents, we further examined whether such models are also preferred by human users. We recruited 12 college students as human participants to interact with the best-performing models, each equipped with different communicative action spaces and supported by the reasoning verifier. We sampled 27 unseen games (9 games for each object count) and measured both task completion rate and efficiency. Each participant was assigned a sequence of 9 games—3 games each with 4, 5, and 6 objects—while being given the complete communicative action space. In each game, they interacted with a model configured with a specific communicative action space, which remained unknown to the participant.\\nTo complement quantitative metrics, we also collected qualitative feedback from participants after each game using the following three questions:\\nDid you find the information communicated by the bot useful?\\nDid the bot make effective use of the information you shared?\\nWere you ever confused by the bot’s behavior?\\nThese questions allowed us to assess the perceived helpfulness, responsiveness, and clarity of the model’s behavior from a human-centered perspective.\\nEvaluation Metrics We employ complementary metrics to assess both effectiveness and efficiency. For effectiveness, we report the Success Rate ( SR ) and subgoal success rate ( Sub.R ) at the first attempt (Pass@1). SR measures the percentage of games successfully completed within a limited number of steps (30 for all the experiments), while Sub.R reflects partial progress by capturing the proportion of objects correctly placed, even when the full game is not successfully completed.\\nFor efficiency, we track the number of steps taken to complete each game and compare it to the optimal solution calculated by our planner. We then compute the Step Ratio ( StepR ), defined as the ratio of the number of executed steps to the number of steps in the optimal solution.\\nWhen a verifier is applied, we additionally report the correction rate ( Corr.R ), indicating the proportion of responses corrected by the verifier. We report standard error for each metrics.\\nAcross all model families, we observe a generally clear hierarchy in task performance: Information Seeking & Providing > > Seeking Only > > No Information Exchange > > Providing Only (See Table 1 ).\\nEnabling both seeking and providing actions consistently yields the highest Success Rate ( SR ) and the lower Step Ratio ( StepR ). confirming that bi-directional exchange is both expressive and effective for coordinating constraints, especially when enhanced with chain-of-though reasoning.\\nPermitting only information seeking is better than permitting only information providing . Targeted queries minimize redundant traffic and let agents actively access the missing piece of information, whereas blind sharing often floods the channel with constraints that are irrelevant or already known by their partners. Therefore, the result suggests that information seeking is a more task-efficient option than unprompted information providing .\\nSurprisingly, disabling communication altogether ( “No Information Exchange” ) ranks high for some variants. Without communication and reasoning process through CoT, the task reduces to pure object manipulation and random guessing;\\ntherefore, the model’s entire capacity is devoted to mastering game rules and action affordance. Llama variants exploit this by memorizing high-probability transition patterns, achieving a success rate greater than 81%. Qwen, which is pre-trained on a different instruction distribution, does not show the same effect, suggesting the phenomenon is model–specific rather than an intrinsic property of the environment.\\nAs shown in Table 1 , adding the reasoning verifier (our best verifier) to the base models leads to large absolute SR gains (labeled in red), ranging from 10 to 40% increment. This reflects the high potential capabilities of the base models, as well as the effectiveness of the assistance from our verifier.\\nTo better understand the underlying behaviors, we further conduct the error analysis across four different action configurations on variants with the best performance (LLaMA-3.1-8B without CoT for no information exchange, and with CoT for the rest, the same for later experiments). We provide detailed explanations on the error taxonomy in Appendix E . Each cell in the table presents error rates in two forms:\\n(Errors/Total Steps)% : The proportion of steps affected by this error type.\\n(Errors/Relevant Action Type)% : The proportion of a specific action type affected by this error (e.g., move, share, seek).\\nFor example, in the \"Wrong Rule Understanding\" row under the “Provide & Seek” column without verifier, the value 28.22% indicates that 28.22% of all 6704 total steps contain this error. The accompanying 38.15% denotes that this error occurred in 38.15% of the 4681 1 1 1 The total number of ”move” action, 4681, is not presented on the table. total \"move\" actions. One wrong action may fall into multiple error types.\\nWithout using verifier, agents across all action configurations demonstrate a similar level of skill in task reasoning. The relatively better performance of the \"no information exchange\" might be primarily due to fewer distractions from communication, allowing agents to focus more on enhancing physical understanding and trying all possible solutions. Also, agents struggle with efficient communication. When they are allowed to proactively share information, a large portion of their sharing actions are labeled as redundant (59.86% and 79.35%, respectively). Moreover, responding to partners’ requests and actively seeking necessary information are challenging.\\nInterestingly, when agents are restricted to only share information upon request, the redundancy issue is reduced. However, their overall performance still lags behind agents with full abilities, indicating that balanced, bidirectional communication remains crucial for effective collaboration.\\nWith the integration of the reasoning verifier, we observe a consistent reduction in error rates and a decrease in the total number of actions taken by the agents. Notably, there is a significant improvement in rule understanding , which aligns well with the design objective of the reasoning verifier. In addition, several issues in communication are also well improved with the involvement of the reasoning verifier, indicating its effectiveness in guiding more efficient and purposeful communication behaviors.\\nThese findings support our central claim: although agents may achieve good performance without information exchange, they do so without truly learning the underlying rules, posing severe safety risks. In contrast, with the support of an environment-based verifier, agents with full communication capabilities exhibit gains both in task performance and rule comprehension . This combination offers a promising path toward developing safer, more interpretable AI systems.\\nWe further examine model behavior in scenarios where two agents are assigned different communicative action spaces. Specifically, we evaluate four asymmetric pairings of action spaces, as shown in Table 3 . We exclude the pair Provide only vs. None, as it is functionally equivalent to Provide & Seek vs. None . In both cases, one agent is unable to respond to queries. Similarly, Seek only vs. None is the same as None vs. None , since the None agent cannot initiate or respond to communication.\\nAcross the evaluated pairings, we observe a consistent drop in performance when agents have mismatched communicative abilities. This finding highlights the importance of aligning communication protocols in collaborative tasks and provides insights into designing agent communication strategies in multi-agent systems. Notably, in the last two pairings listed in Table 3 , agents are sometimes forced to rely on random guessing. For instance, a Seek only agent cannot proactively share unless asked—yet its Provide only partner lacks the ability to initiate queries. These structural mismatches lead to particularly sharp declines in task success, strengthening the need for matched-communication agent design.\\nWe follow the model selection in Table 3 from RQ3 and recruit human participants to play games with them.\\nAs shown in Table 4 , human participants, with complete communicative action space, achieve 100% success rate across all action space configurations within 30 steps for each game. Agents with communicative actions perform efficient collaboration with human participants, while agents that cannot communicate spend far more rounds completing tasks.\\nIn addition to qualitative metrics, we also conduct quantitative analyses to better understand the perceived helpfulness, responsiveness, and clarity of the models from a human-centered perspective. Figure 2 presents the distributions of participant responses across these three dimensions.\\nWe find that most participants agree the agents generally communicate useful information and make effective use of the information shared by the human. Notably, agents with the Seek only configuration are rated as especially helpful—likely because they have learned to selectively share the most relevant information when prompted. Interestingly, in the None condition for Q1 (usefulness of communicated information), participants often interpret the agents’ physical actions as implicit communication from which they base their evaluations.\\nHowever, we observe strong disagreement regarding the clarity of agent behavior. Agents with Seek only or None configurations tend to cause more confusion. Specifically, while Seek only agents are seen as helpful and responsive, they still leave users uncertain—possibly because they never proactively offer information before making a move. This suggests that even if an agent is effective and efficient in completing the task, a lack of initiative in communication can reduce the perceived clarity of its behavior. Similarly, models without any communicative capabilities achieve near perfect performance in self-play (94.33% SR ), yet they are perceived as unclear in human-AI collaboration. Instead, although models that can initiate information providing take slightly more steps, they offer better clarity in human-AI collaboration. These results highlight that beyond task success, proactive and transparent communication plays a critical role in fostering human trust and understanding in collaborative settings.',\n",

This finding highlights the importance of aligning communication protocols in collaborative tasks and provides insights into designing agent communication strategies in multi-agent systems. Notably, in the last two pairings listed in Table 3 , agents are sometimes forced to rely on random guessing. For instance, a Seek only agent cannot proactively share unless asked—yet its Provide only partner lacks the ability to initiate queries. These structural mismatches lead to particularly sharp declines in task success, strengthening the need for matched-communication agent design.\\nWe follow the model selection in Table 3 from RQ3 and recruit human participants to play games with them.\\nAs shown in Table 4 , human participants, with complete communicative action space, achieve 100% success rate across all action space configurations within 30 steps for each game. Agents with communicative actions perform efficient collaboration with human participants, while agents that cannot communicate spend far more rounds completing tasks.\\nIn addition to qualitative metrics, we also conduct quantitative analyses to better understand the perceived helpfulness, responsiveness, and clarity of the models from a human-centered perspective. Figure 2 presents the distributions of participant responses across these three dimensions.\\nWe find that most participants agree the agents generally communicate useful information and make effective use of the information shared by the human. Notably, agents with the Seek only configuration are rated as especially helpful—likely because they have learned to selectively share the most relevant information when prompted. Interestingly, in the None condition for Q1 (usefulness of communicated information), participants often interpret the agents’ physical actions as implicit communication from which they base their evaluations.\\nHowever, we observe strong disagreement regarding the clarity of agent behavior. Agents with Seek only or None configurations tend to cause more confusion. Specifically, while Seek only agents are seen as helpful and responsive, they still leave users uncertain—possibly because they never proactively offer information before making a move. This suggests that even if an agent is effective and efficient in completing the task, a lack of initiative in communication can reduce the perceived clarity of its behavior. Similarly, models without any communicative capabilities achieve near perfect performance in self-play (94.33% SR ), yet they are perceived as unclear in human-AI collaboration. Instead, although models that can initiate information providing take slightly more steps, they offer better clarity in human-AI collaboration.

Targeted queries minimize redundant traffic and let agents actively access the missing piece of information, whereas blind sharing often floods the channel with constraints that are irrelevant or already known by their partners. Therefore, the result suggests that information seeking is a more task-efficient option than unprompted information providing .\\nSurprisingly, disabling communication altogether ( “No Information Exchange” ) ranks high for some variants. Without communication and reasoning process through CoT, the task reduces to pure object manipulation and random guessing;\\ntherefore, the model’s entire capacity is devoted to mastering game rules and action affordance. Llama variants exploit this by memorizing high-probability transition patterns, achieving a success rate greater than 81%.

This reflects the high potential capabilities of the base models, as well as the effectiveness of the assistance from our verifier.\\nTo better understand the underlying behaviors, we further conduct the error analysis across four different action configurations on variants with the best performance (LLaMA-3.1-8B without CoT for no information exchange, and with CoT for the rest, the same for later experiments). We provide detailed explanations on the error taxonomy in Appendix E . Each cell in the table presents error rates in two forms:\\n(Errors/Total Steps)% : The proportion of steps affected by this error type.\\n(Errors/Relevant Action Type)% : The proportion of a specific action type affected by this error (e.g., move, share, seek).\\nFor example, in the \"Wrong Rule Understanding\" row under the “Provide & Seek” column without verifier, the value 28.22% indicates that 28.22% of all 6704 total steps contain this error. The accompanying 38.15% denotes that this error occurred in 38.15% of the 4681 1 1 1 The total number of ”move” action, 4681, is not presented on the table. total \"move\" actions. One wrong action may fall into multiple error types.\\nWithout using verifier, agents across all action configurations demonstrate a similar level of skill in task reasoning. The relatively better performance of the \"no information exchange\" might be primarily due to fewer distractions from communication, allowing agents to focus more on enhancing physical understanding and trying all possible solutions. Also, agents struggle with efficient communication. When they are allowed to proactively share information, a large portion of their sharing actions are labeled as redundant (59.86% and 79.35%, respectively). Moreover, responding to partners’ requests and actively seeking necessary information are challenging.\\nInterestingly, when agents are restricted to only share information upon request, the redundancy issue is reduced. However, their overall performance still lags behind agents with full abilities, indicating that balanced, bidirectional communication remains crucial for effective collaboration.\\nWith the integration of the reasoning verifier, we observe a consistent reduction in error rates and a decrease in the total number of actions taken by the agents.

Doing so would require agents to possess richer perceptual capabilities and a deeper understanding of the environment’s dynamics. Nevertheless, the verifier is readily applicable and easily deployable in a wide range of simulated environments, where structured feedback is available.\\nSecond, our human evaluation was conducted on a relatively small scale. Due to constraints in time and computational resources, we were unable to deploy multiple models simultaneously, limiting the ability to compare different configurations within a single user study. In future work, we plan to expand the study by recruiting more participants and enabling broader comparisons across models.

Throughout the search process, the planner maintains an up-to-date representation of the player’s knowledge, incorporating both the communication history and the current positions of objects on the board.

This diversity ensures that both types of communicative actions—information providing and information seeking—are well represented in the demonstrations. Without this balance, solutions dominated by unprompted sharing would disproportionately appear, as they often require fewer steps to complete.\\nIn scenarios involving random guessing, the optimal trajectories are those in which agents correctly guess the target location on the first attempt.

To address this limitation, this paper studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game.\\n In this game, two LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints required to solve the puzzle.\\n We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication strategies and verification signals from the environment.\\n Empirical results highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an environment-based verifier, we enhance agents’ ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles'},\n",

Logic Programming (LP) has been a powerful declarative paradigm based on formal logic since the 70s ( [ 44 ] ).\\nContrary to the traditional imperative programming paradigm, where the focus is on how the problem should be solved, in logic programming the program is a description of what is the problem.\\nLogic programs represent knowledge of a domain using facts and rules to state what is true. An LP system can derive new knowledge by means of logical inference and answer users’ queries about knowledge not explicitly encoded in the program.\\nExamples of LP languages include Prolog ( [ 10 ] ), Datalog ( [ 1 ] ), and Answer Set Programming ( [ 24 ] ).\\nSince the inference procedure is independent of the knowledge base, logic programs are generally flexible, reusable, and easy to maintain and adapt as new requirements arise.\\nNew knowledge can be added without changing the inference algorithm.\\nDespite the many advantages, LP also has some challenges.\\nThe knowledge base needs to be carefully structured.\\nTo mitigate this problem, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) aims at automatically inducing knowledge bases from data ( [ 60 ] ).\\nVarious ILP systems have been proposed and have found successful applications ( [ 12 ] ) in\\nbioinformatics and drug design ( [ 74 , 75 , 31 ] ),\\nnatural language processing ( [ 56 ] ),\\ngames ( [ 46 , 3 ] ),\\ndata curation and transformation ( [ 26 ] ),\\nexplainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) ( [ 91 ] ),\\nand learning from trajectories ( [ 32 ] ).\\nSome systems are capable of performing predicate invention, i.e., introducing new unnamed predicates into the learned program to adhere to a language bias or create simpler rules.\\nExamples of such systems are POPPI ( [ 14 ] ), PHIL ( [ 62 ] ), Nesy- π \\\\pi ( [ 73 ] ), and many others.\\nThe presence of such predicates poses a big challenge for both programmers and final users, since it is difficult to understand their intended meaning, especially when the output theory is composed of a large number of rules.\\nAdditionally, manually renaming them is usually unfeasible, since it requires the availability of a domain expert.\\nIn fact, unnamed predicates not only complicate human understanding of the logic program but also hinder the debugging process for programmers.\\nIn this paper, we thus propose to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide names to these predicates.\\nIn the last few years, LLMs ( [ 2 ] ), a type of generative AI , have proven to be highly performing in a wide array of tasks across many domains, including natural language processing, art, and data science, often producing human-like results ( [ 6 , 36 ] ). LLMs are based on deep learning architectures, typically using transformer models ( [ 50 , 83 ] ), and are pre-trained on massive amounts of data, enabling them to process and generate natural language and other types of contents to perform a wide range of tasks, such as text, audio, and video generation, text summarization, code generation, chatbots and query answering.\\nTherefore, the goal of this work is to exploit LLMs to generate semantically meaningful predicate names, which should be naturally understood by the user.\\nTo our knowledge, no systems currently perform automatic renaming of unnamed predicates.\\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows:\\nSection 2 provides an overview of the relevant background;\\nSection 3 presents a review of related work;\\nSection 4 outlines the methodology used in the study;\\nSection 5 describes the experimental setup and approach, and presents the results of the experiments;\\nSection 6 discusses the findings and limitations of this work.\\nFinally, Section 7 summarizes key findings and suggests directions for future research.',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'ILP systems may sometimes introduce invented predicates that are not explicitly defined in the knowledge base or problem description.\\nThere are many reasons to invent new predicates, such as capturing intermediate relationships, simplifying complex rules, enhancing the program’s modularity and flexibility, expressing a new concept, improving the accuracy while reducing the complexity of a hypothesis, or when the given vocabulary is insufficient to express the target theory.\\nHowever, invented symbols have a placeholder name, such as “ inv ”. The lack of a meaningful name makes it difficult to understand the intended use of the predicate and its reusability.\\nIn ILP ( [ 58 ] ), Predicate Invention (PI) was first introduced in inverse resolution ( [ 59 ] ), and early works have been summarized in [ 77 ] . PI refers to those techniques that enable systems to automatically discover new predicates, which are not part of the initial knowledge base ( [ 78 ] ).\\nOne of the most straightforward examples of PI , shown in Example 1 , is the invention of the predicate parent to learn the definition of grandparent , given only the predicates mother and father :\\nExample of PI , where the invented predicate inv represents the parent relation.\\nIn this way, a more compact theory has been created.\\nDespite gaining increasing attention in recent developments, PI is still not widely spread ( [ 12 ] ).\\nAs a matter of fact, the invention of new, useful predicates is not a trivial task ( [ 60 ] ), as it is often challenging to determine when and if they are necessary, how many arguments they should have (i.e., their arity), and what their order and type should be ( [ 78 , 45 ] ).\\nMETAGOL ( [ 61 ] ) is a metarule-based approach that seeks to overcome this limitation by using metarules to determine and restrict the syntax of rules, although they should be predefined by the user.\\nPOPPER ( [ 13 ] ) is an ILP system based on the Learning From Failures (LFF) framework, which decomposes the ILP problem into three steps: generate, test, and constrain. In each cycle, POPPER generates a logic program based on current constraints, evaluates it against examples, and, if the hypothesis is incomplete or inconsistent, derives new constraints from the failure. This iterative refinement continues until a consistent and complete program is found. POPPI ( [ 14 ] ) is an ILP method that supports the creation of new predicates without needing human intervention to specify the arity or metarules. POPPI thus extends POPPER by enabling automatic PI, casting the ILP problem as an Answer Set Programming (ASP) task.\\n[ 73 ] proposed NeSy- π \\\\pi , a Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) approach for the classification of complex visual scenes, that processes visual inputs with deep neural networks and invents new concepts.\\nNevertheless, the discovery of new predicates is not limited to PI .\\nIn the context of Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) ( [ 71 ] ), Hierarchical Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLPs) ( [ 20 ] ) are a restriction of Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions (LPADs) ( [ 84 ] ).\\nIn HPLPs clauses and predicates are hierarchically organized.\\nParameter learning for HIerarchical probabilistic Logic programs (PHIL) ( [ 62 ] ) is an algorithm for learning the parameters of HPLPs .\\nGiven a specific form of LPADs defining the target predicate r in terms of input predicates, for which the definition is given as input and is certain, and hidden predicates, defined by the rules of the program, PHIL learns the probabilities of atoms for the target predicate. Each clause in the program has a single atom in the head annotated with a probability.\\nThese programs can be divided into layers. Each layer defines a set of hidden unnamed predicates in terms of either the predicates from the layer below or the input predicates.\\nIn Example 2 from [ 62 ] in the UWCSE domain ( [ 42 ] ) we can see an example of such predicates.\\nThe first clause C \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 C\\\\_1 states that the probability of a student (A) being advised by a professor (B) is 0.3 if both A and B have worked on a project (C), and there is a relation r \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 r\\\\_1\\\\_1 between the student, the professor, and the project.\\nThe relation r \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 r\\\\_1\\\\_1 is defined in clause C \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 C\\\\_1\\\\_1\\\\_1 , which states that r \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 r\\\\_1\\\\_1 holds with a probability of 0.2 if there is a publication P authored by both A and B and produced within project C. r \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 r\\\\_1\\\\_1 can then be renamed as “collaboretedOn”.\\nWe can thus say that a student (A) is advised by a professor (B) if there is a project (C) on which both have worked, and A and B have collaborated on project C.\\nThe first clause C \\u200b _ \\u200b 2 C\\\\_2 states that a student (A) is advised by a professor (B) with a probability of 0.6 if A is a teaching assistant (ta) for course C, which is taught by B.\\nUnnamed predicate r_1_1 created by PHIL in the learning process.\\nIn the context of abductive logic programming ( [ 37 ] ), the approach proposed by ( [ 72 ] ) aims to abduce relations by leveraging linear algebra in vector spaces. Hidden relationships between entities are learnt through matrix operations, making it useful for applications where explicit rules are hard to define.\\nFocusing on Datalog programs with binary predicates, the authors address both non-recursive and recursive cases.\\nFor instance, in the non-recursive case, given two relations r 1 \\u200b ( X , Y ) r_{1}(X,Y) and r 3 \\u200b ( X , Z ) r_{3}(X,Z) , represented as adjacency matrices R 1 \\\\textbf{R}_{1} and R 3 \\\\textbf{R}_{3} respectively, the system learns a new relation r 2 \\u200b ( Y , Z ) r_{2}(Y,Z) , represented by matrix R 2 \\\\textbf{R}_{2} , that explains how r 1 r_{1} and r 3 r_{3} interact. This is done by solving the matrix equation R 3 = m \\u200b i \\u200b n 1 \\u200b ( R 1 \\u200b R 2 ) \\\\textbf{R}_{3}=min_{1}(\\\\textbf{R}_{1}\\\\textbf{R}_{2}) , where m \\u200b i \\u200b n 1 \\u200b ( x ) min_{1}(x) is a nonlinear function, so that r 3 \\u200b ( X , Z ) ⇔ ∃ Y \\u200b r 1 \\u200b ( X , Y ) ∧ r 2 \\u200b ( Y , Z ) r_{3}(X,Z)\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\exists Yr_{1}(X,Y)\\\\land r_{2}(Y,Z) . Although r 1 r_{1} and r 3 r_{3} are known, r 2 r_{2} is not, therefore it could be useful to find a meaningful name for easier reuse.\\nFor example, the authors have applied this method to a subset of the FB15k ( [ 5 ] ) knowledge graph, involving person and film.\\nBy considering the relations language(X,Z) and genre(X,Y) , the following rule can be discovered:\\nHere, the abduced relation r 2 \\u200b _ \\u200b a \\u200b b \\u200b d r_{2\\\\_abd} , which isn’t originally in the graph, could be interpreted as genre_lang , implying that genre and language are somewhat related to each other.\\nHowever, such an interpretation on the new predicate r 2 \\u200b _ \\u200b a \\u200b b \\u200b d r_{2\\\\_abd} as well as the predicate name genre_lang have to be given by the user.\\nGenerative AI ( [ 22 ] ) is the subset of AI techniques that generate new content in the form of text, code, images, audio, and video.\\nOne type of Generative AI are Foundation Models (FMs) ( [ 4 ] ), very large Machine Learning (ML) models trained on enormous quantities of generic and unlabeled data and thus capable of performing a wide range of tasks.\\nAmong FMs , LLMs are based on the transformer architecture ( [ 50 , 83 , 2 ] ). They are composed of multiple layers of neural networks, with an encoder and a decoder ( [ 67 , 89 ] ) that process sequences of text, capturing the connections and the relationships between words. Thanks to the self-attention mechanism ( [ 83 ] ), the model can consider distant tokens as well.\\nTo represent words, LLMs use multi-dimensional vectors, called word embeddings, in a way that keeps related words close to each other in the embedding space.\\nThese models often have billions of parameters and can be trained on vast amounts of data, enabling them to learn not only the grammar but also the semantics of a language.\\nGiven an input sequence, parameters are continuously adjusted during the training phase to maximize the likelihood of the next tokens.\\nLLMs have gained popularity in recent years ( [ 6 ] ) thanks to their ability to generate meaningful content from little input.\\nVarious LLMs have been specifically trained and used for automatic code generation showing good performances ( [ 6 , 36 ] ), such as OpenAI’s Codex ( [ 7 ] ), and its GitHub implementation, Copilot 1 1 1 https://copilot.github.com .\\nFor example, [ 66 ] have tested Codex to determine if it can identify security flaws and fix them, obtaining positive results on hand-crafted datasets; however, real-world scenarios proved to be more challenging. [ 57 ] demonstrated that Copilot can become a useful tool for software developers for implementing simple procedures, speeding up their work. Given their expertise, even if the generate code contains bugs, they should be able to identify and fix them.\\nPrompting is crucial when working with LLMs to get the most relevant and useful answers. A carefully crafted prompt can significantly simplify the process by precisely defining the goal we aim to achieve.\\nA basic prompt usually includes only the instructions for the task at hand, such as “summarize” or “classify”. Other elements that can be included are: context; the audience; the role of the model; input data; output format; and examples of inputs and outputs ( [ 2 ] ). The tone of the response can also be controlled. Additionally, the order also matters: information in the initial or in the final part of the prompt is often given more weight than that in the middle. This behavior is referred to as primacy effect and recency effect, respectively ( [ 2 ] , [ 49 ] ).\\nThese components are not always mandatory, but the more specific the prompt, the better the response will be. Giving an overly general prompt to the LLM may result in its inability to complete the given task.\\nOne or more examples of the desired output can also be included in the prompt.\\nThis is referred to as in-context learning or few-shot learning ( [ 54 , 6 ] ), in which a few examples of the task at hand and a test example are provided, as shown in Example 3 taken from [ 6 ] . ( [ 81 , 2 ] ) proved that implementing these strategies leads to improved performances.\\nFew-shot prompting example from [ 6 ] .\\nAnother prompting technique is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting, in which the output of one prompt is given as input of the next one, creating in this way a chain of prompts. CoT is at the base of LLMs reasoning ( [ 86 , 41 ] ), as shown by OpenAI’s reasoning models ( [ 65 ] ). Before generating an answer, these models learn to refine their thinking process, correct their mistakes, and explore different paths, building a chain of thought and leading to a higher-quality final result.\\nOne of the main challenges in using LLMs is designing prompts that are both clear and effective in guiding the model toward the desired output. The quality of the prompt has a significant impact on the model’s performance, and even small variations in wording or structure may lead to different results. Crafting an optimal prompt is therefore not straightforward, but is a gradual, iterative process that requires careful experimentation to determine what works best for each specific use case.\\nAnother major challenge is handling the inherent non-determinism of LLMs , as the same prompt can yield different outputs across multiple runs, making it difficult to ensure consistency and reproducibility.',\n",

       "      'paragraphs': 'ILP systems may sometimes introduce invented predicates that are not explicitly defined in the knowledge base or problem description.\\nThere are many reasons to invent new predicates, such as capturing intermediate relationships, simplifying complex rules, enhancing the program’s modularity and flexibility, expressing a new concept, improving the accuracy while reducing the complexity of a hypothesis, or when the given vocabulary is insufficient to express the target theory.\\nHowever, invented symbols have a placeholder name, such as “ inv ”. The lack of a meaningful name makes it difficult to understand the intended use of the predicate and its reusability.\\nIn ILP ( [ 58 ] ), Predicate Invention (PI) was first introduced in inverse resolution ( [ 59 ] ), and early works have been summarized in [ 77 ] . PI refers to those techniques that enable systems to automatically discover new predicates, which are not part of the initial knowledge base ( [ 78 ] ).\\nOne of the most straightforward examples of PI , shown in Example 1 , is the invention of the predicate parent to learn the definition of grandparent , given only the predicates mother and father :\\nExample of PI , where the invented predicate inv represents the parent relation.\\nIn this way, a more compact theory has been created.\\nDespite gaining increasing attention in recent developments, PI is still not widely spread ( [ 12 ] ).\\nAs a matter of fact, the invention of new, useful predicates is not a trivial task ( [ 60 ] ), as it is often challenging to determine when and if they are necessary, how many arguments they should have (i.e., their arity), and what their order and type should be ( [ 78 , 45 ] ).\\nMETAGOL ( [ 61 ] ) is a metarule-based approach that seeks to overcome this limitation by using metarules to determine and restrict the syntax of rules, although they should be predefined by the user.\\nPOPPER ( [ 13 ] ) is an ILP system based on the Learning From Failures (LFF) framework, which decomposes the ILP problem into three steps: generate, test, and constrain. In each cycle, POPPER generates a logic program based on current constraints, evaluates it against examples, and, if the hypothesis is incomplete or inconsistent, derives new constraints from the failure. This iterative refinement continues until a consistent and complete program is found. POPPI ( [ 14 ] ) is an ILP method that supports the creation of new predicates without needing human intervention to specify the arity or metarules. POPPI thus extends POPPER by enabling automatic PI, casting the ILP problem as an Answer Set Programming (ASP) task.\\n[ 73 ] proposed NeSy- π \\\\pi , a Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) approach for the classification of complex visual scenes, that processes visual inputs with deep neural networks and invents new concepts.\\nNevertheless, the discovery of new predicates is not limited to PI .\\nIn the context of Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) ( [ 71 ] ), Hierarchical Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLPs) ( [ 20 ] ) are a restriction of Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions (LPADs) ( [ 84 ] ).\\nIn HPLPs clauses and predicates are hierarchically organized.\\nParameter learning for HIerarchical probabilistic Logic programs (PHIL) ( [ 62 ] ) is an algorithm for learning the parameters of HPLPs .\\nGiven a specific form of LPADs defining the target predicate r in terms of input predicates, for which the definition is given as input and is certain, and hidden predicates, defined by the rules of the program, PHIL learns the probabilities of atoms for the target predicate. Each clause in the program has a single atom in the head annotated with a probability.\\nThese programs can be divided into layers. Each layer defines a set of hidden unnamed predicates in terms of either the predicates from the layer below or the input predicates.\\nIn Example 2 from [ 62 ] in the UWCSE domain ( [ 42 ] ) we can see an example of such predicates.\\nThe first clause C \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 C\\\\_1 states that the probability of a student (A) being advised by a professor (B) is 0.3 if both A and B have worked on a project (C), and there is a relation r \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 r\\\\_1\\\\_1 between the student, the professor, and the project.\\nThe relation r \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 r\\\\_1\\\\_1 is defined in clause C \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 C\\\\_1\\\\_1\\\\_1 , which states that r \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 r\\\\_1\\\\_1 holds with a probability of 0.2 if there is a publication P authored by both A and B and produced within project C. r \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 \\u200b _ \\u200b 1 r\\\\_1\\\\_1 can then be renamed as “collaboretedOn”.\\nWe can thus say that a student (A) is advised by a professor (B) if there is a project (C) on which both have worked, and A and B have collaborated on project C.\\nThe first clause C \\u200b _ \\u200b 2 C\\\\_2 states that a student (A) is advised by a professor (B) with a probability of 0.6 if A is a teaching assistant (ta) for course C, which is taught by B.\\nUnnamed predicate r_1_1 created by PHIL in the learning process.\\nIn the context of abductive logic programming ( [ 37 ] ), the approach proposed by ( [ 72 ] ) aims to abduce relations by leveraging linear algebra in vector spaces. Hidden relationships between entities are learnt through matrix operations, making it useful for applications where explicit rules are hard to define.\\nFocusing on Datalog programs with binary predicates, the authors address both non-recursive and recursive cases.\\nFor instance, in the non-recursive case, given two relations r 1 \\u200b ( X , Y ) r_{1}(X,Y) and r 3 \\u200b ( X , Z ) r_{3}(X,Z) , represented as adjacency matrices R 1 \\\\textbf{R}_{1} and R 3 \\\\textbf{R}_{3} respectively, the system learns a new relation r 2 \\u200b ( Y , Z ) r_{2}(Y,Z) , represented by matrix R 2 \\\\textbf{R}_{2} , that explains how r 1 r_{1} and r 3 r_{3} interact.

       "    'paragraphs': 'PI is considered a critical step, yet it is still not widely spread ( [ 12 ] ).\\nChoosing suitable names for newly created predicates is an even more neglected area in ILP and has not received much attention so far, with only a few attempts made in the past.\\nIn [ 30 ] the authors adopted a meta-level abduction approach to identify previously unknown relations within a knowledge graph that represents a specific domain. In this setting, new predicates are invented as existentially quantified variables, which act as placeholders for the missing or hidden knowledge. While the system is capable of structurally generating these new predicates, their semantic meaning (i.e., their names) is not determined automatically and must instead be manually defined or interpreted based on the domain context. This highlights a key limitation: the invented predicates are syntactically valid but lack meaningful, human-readable names without further domain-specific interpretation. In the rule abduction approach proposed in [ 40 ] , the authors built databases related to the cello playing domain to assist performers in assigning meaningful names to new abduced rules.\\nAs the power of LLMs continues to grow, we could leverage their capabilities to enable them to reason about rules and generate meaningful names for previously unnamed predicates.\\nWhile many have highlighted the impressive performances of LLMs with zero or few-shot prompting ( [ 6 , 41 , 86 ] ), a rising number of recent works have explored their reasoning ability on more complex tasks ( [ 48 ] ) involving common knowledge and planning ( [ 82 , 79 ] ), math ( [ 8 , 41 ] ), and symbolic reasoning ( [ 33 , 41 , 76 ] ).\\nIn particular, LLMs are already widely employed in software engineering ( [ 6 , 29 , 35 , 36 ] ), where they typically generate code with semantically meaningful variable names.\\n[ 48 ] evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs on an ILP benchmark and found their performance lacking when compared to a smaller neural program induction model.\\nThey evaluated LLMs on two benchmarks, one of which required the model to induce programs to deduce more complex family relationships from some basic ones.\\nAlthough this setup is similar to ours, they focused on assessing the relational reasoning capabilities of LLMs using standard natural language and truth value prompting. In contrast, our goal was to determine if LLMs could identify names that are relevant to the context of the example. [ 27 ] used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for property induction, a traditional inductive reasoning task that involves generalizing a property from a few examples to new cases. In their experiments, participants—including both humans and language models—were presented with a set of objects sharing a property and asked to infer whether new objects shared the same property. Although GPT-3.5 had difficulty capturing various aspects of human behavior, GPT-4’s performance was mostly close to that of humans.\\n[ 90 ] investigated the ability of pretrained language models to infer natural language rules from natural language facts, obtaining promising results. [ 85 ] proposed an approach to improve LLMs ’ inductive reasoning ability. They generate hypotheses in natural language, and then translate them into specific programs used for making predictions, breaking the task into two levels of abstraction and outperforming current baselines.\\nIn [ 80 ] the authors explored techniques to extract and leverage the knowledge embedded in LLMs by converting it into different types of logic programs, aiming to improve reasoning capabilities and ensure that LLM outputs are consistent with their intended purposes.\\nAdditionally, [ 23 ] aimed to determine whether LLMs can address ILP tasks, analyzing their capabilities and limitations on logic theory induction. Their results indicate that while larger LLMs can achieve competitive results compared to state-of-the-art ILP systems, long predicate relationship chains are still an obstacle for LLMs in inductive reasoning tasks. [ 15 ] proposed NeSyGPT, a novel architecture that integrates neural and symbolic reasoning, that fine-tunes a vision-language foundation model to extract symbolic features from raw data, and then learns an expressive answer set program using them. The results show that NeSyGPT outperforms various baselines in accuracy and can be used for more complex NeSy tasks. They thus demonstrated that LLMs can reduce the need for manual efforts in automating the interface between neural and symbolic components.\\nRemaining in the NeSy field, [ 17 ] presented a novel approach to expand the knowledge base by integrating LLMs with structured semantic representations. It employs a state-of-the-art LLM to produce a natural language description of an input image, which is then transformed into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph. This graph is further extended with logical design patterns and layered semantics derived from linguistic and factual knowledge bases. [ 38 ] proposed LLM2LAS, a system that learns commonsense knowledge in the form of ASP programs, from story-based question and answers in natural language, using only a few examples and combining LLMs ’ semantic parsing abilities with ILASP ( [ 47 ] ), a tool for learning ASP programs.\\nThe authors of [ 33 ] used an LLM to generate ASP programs representing logic puzzles, given their description in natural language. Here, the authors state that the LLM successfully produced an ASP , despite some minor errors that were corrected manually, confirming the possibility of leveraging LLMs to support the creation of ASP programs.\\nAlthough some findings suggest that LLMs still struggle with complex reasoning ( [ 11 , 48 ] ), this proves that the field yields some potential and is worth further investigation, especially considering the continuous improvements of LLMs .',\n",

       "    'paragraphs': 'In this section, we outline our approach for assigning meaningful names to unnamed predicates in a set of logical rules.\\nAfter deciding the number n of LLMs to query for suggestions, the number k of suggestions they should provide, and the number j of LLM judges, the pipeline we propose consists of three main steps, as shown in Figure 1 :\\nAsking the n LLMs to find a meaningful name for each unnamed predicate, for k times to tackle possible hallucinations; for these preliminary experiments, we decided to repeat the question three times.\\nAsking the models to choose the most suitable name among their own suggested names.\\nAsking the j judges to score the different proposed names, obtaining a ranking.\\nTo assess the ability of the LLMs to find correct names for unnamed predicates, we created different examples of logic theories, which represent the possible output of an ILP system in a declarative logic programming language . Although constructs that are specific to Prolog were used for these experiments, this approach could be applied to scenarios where other logic programming languages are employed.\\nFor example, if rules are written in a purely declarative manner, those rules may be commonly used for both Prolog and ASP.\\nIn each set of rules, we replaced the true names of some or all predicates with placeholders.\\nWe tested various formats (e.g., A, P, h0, and so on) for placeholders to determine whether the placeholder name influences the suggestions.\\nUnnamed predicates can occur in the head and/or in the body of one or multiple rules. For all case studies presented in this paper, the true names of the unnamed predicates are included as comments (e.g., # P = coauthors) for the reader’s reference. These comments were not included in the prompts provided to the LLMs .\\nThe first and simplest case study, coauthors , consists of a single rule, as shown in Case Study 1 .\\nHere, P is only one unnamed predicate appearing in the head of a rule, which states that there are two researchers (A and B) and both authored a paper (C); P could thus be renamed as “coauthors”.\\nRules of the coauthors case study.\\nThe second case study, family , is described in Case Study 2 and contains several rules representing various family relationships.\\nUnnamed predicates appear both in the head and in the body of the rules, with h2 being the only exception, as it appears only on the head on a single rule.\\nRules of the family case study.\\nThe third case study, math , shown in Case Study 3 , is a set of rules representing basic mathematical operations.\\nAlso in this case, unnamed predicates can appear both in the head and in the body of the rules.\\nRules of the math case study.\\nWe also created simpler one-rule examples to investigate the ability of the LLMs to find a meaningful name for predicates appearing only in the body.\\nThese examples are taken from the previous ones and are shown in Case Study 4 : the grandparent rule has predicate h0 in the body, representing the parent relation; the cousins rule with predicate h3 representing the siblings relation; and lastly, the lcm rule, representing the computation of the least common multiple using the greatest common divisor, uses predicates G and H , being product and quotient , respectively.\\nIn all these cases, the unnamed predicates appear only in the body of the rule.\\nRules of the grandparent, cousins, and lcm case studies.\\nIn addition, we also tried a real-world knowledge base taken from the mutagenesis dataset ( [ 74 ] ), a classic ILP benchmark dataset for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR), that is, predicting the biological activity of chemicals from their physicochemical properties or molecular structure. The goal is to predict the mutagenicity of compounds given their chemical structure. We used the ring_theory provided with the dataset and removed the names of most of the head predicates. The set of rules is extensive, with 24 head predicates to be renamed, such as those in Case Study 5 .\\nExamples of rules of the Mutagenesis ring theory. Here, the \"@>\" operator checks if the first term is greater than the second term according to Prolog’s standard order of terms.\\nSome of these rules are relatively short (1 to 3 body atoms), while others are much more complex, with more than 5 body atoms.\\nTo test our approach on an actual ILP theory, we designed a new case study and used POPPER to learn a recursive definition of a reachability predicate over a graph defined by bidirectional (road/2) and unidirectional (one_way/2) connections. The goal was to induce a definition of reachable/2 using predicate invention, such that POPPER introduces an intermediate invented predicate (e.g., inv1/2) to generalize a single-step path relation.\\nThe resulting program is presented in Case Study 6 .\\nGiven that this case study was specifically designed by the authors for this work, it is not present in the existing literature to the best of our knowledge. As a result, it is unlikely that the LLMs were exposed to it during training.\\nRules of the reachability case study.\\nWe use zero-shot prompting for all the examples.

The memory limit was set to 100 GB, and the time limit was set to 17 hours and 30 minutes.\\nWe carried out several initial prompt design attempts to observe how LLMs responded under varying instructions. For instance, after noticing that the models often provided multiple equivalent suggestions, we decided to limit them to just one.\\nWe also added a constraint to prevent models from altering the structure of the rules, after observing such behaviors with some LLMs . Each of these attempts was executed independently, ensuring that no contextual information was shared between runs. Importantly, the models did not retain any memory of previous executions; in particular, ChatGPT was used with the memory feature explicitly disabled to prevent any persistence of prior interactions. After analyzing the models’ responses and identifying recurring issues or undesired behaviors, we refined our instructions iteratively. The final version of the prompt, shown in Figure 2 , was then used to rerun all experiments from scratch. Additionally, we observed that models sometimes gave the correct response on the first try, while other times they required several attempts. To address this, and given the non-deterministic nature of the answers, we decided to repeat the question a certain number of times to address this issue. In these preliminary experiments, we decided to use three repetitions.\\nAll the models handled the task appropriately, so zero-shot prompting was sufficient in this case. Most of them followed the instructions accurately, with only a few exceptions.\\nFor example, Llama usually wrote a sentence (explaining the reasons for its choices) instead of adopting the requested format.\\nIn such cases, however, the name can be extracted from the answer using basic string manipulation.\\nAfter getting three suggestions out of each model, we asked them to choose only one name among their own ones.\\nTables 1 and 2 show the final choices made by each model for each predicate of each case study; we also report for each LLM how many of the suggested names could be considered correct. Table 3 provides a summary of the number of correct name suggestions per predicate. Each model receives a score of 1 if its final suggestion matches the expected name, and 0 otherwise. In the final column, we indicate how many LLMs correctly named each predicate. This overview allows us to easily compare the performance of the models on a per-predicate basis and identify which predicates were more challenging.\\nThe coauthors case study, which was the simplest, presented no difficulties for the models. In fact, all of them suggested a correct name, although sometimes too verbose.\\nRegarding the family case study, the GPT models and Command R+ provided the correct name of each predicate, and Gemini failed to identify only h4.\\nLlama was completely unable to find meaningful names for most of the predicates, with only two correct suggestions. Furthermore, one out of the three times it rewrote most of the rules, making its answer completely wrong.\\nFalconMamba and Falcon3 also struggled with the family case study, as none of the answers were correct.\\nIn particular, Falcon3 provided the answer for only one predicate, likely being misled by the word “ONE” in the prompt.\\nFor this reason, its answers were not considered.\\nFor the math case study, the GPT models correctly identified almost all the names.\\nGemini followed closely, with only two mistakes.\\nFalcon3 and Command R+ also identified most of the correct names, while Llama just over half of them.\\nOn the other hand, FalconMamba simply rewrote the rules with different capital letters all three times, and therefore its answers were ignored.\\nMany models couldn’t find the correct name for predicates L ( isDivisor , suggested only by Command R+), M ( gcd ), and N ( lcm ); these last two were correctly identified only by ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o3mini.\\nIn the lcm case study, most models struggled to identify the correct names for predicates G and H, namely product and quotient (or equivalent terms).\\nOnly ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o3mini provided correct suggestions.\\nFinding siblings for predicate h3 in the cousins case study was also challenging for some models, even if they suggested it in the family case study. Only the GPT models, Gemini and LLama provided the correct name.\\nFor the grandparent case study, all the models correctly suggested parent for predicate h0, except for FalconMamba.\\nIn Table 4 we report the results obtained on the Mutagenesis ring theory, using ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o3mini.\\nSome of the predicates appear to be similar to the original ones, but overall it is difficult to determine whether the suggested names are meaningful. In such a case, a domain expert should make the final decision.\\nTo improve the quality of the output, the models could be fine-tuned on the specific domain; alternatively, context (e.g., in the form of scientific papers) could be provided.\\nIt is worth mentioning another attempt we made with Mutagenesis. For this initial experiment, we used a less constrained version of Prompt 1 , where we simply asked for suggestions for all the predicates, without specifying the context or limiting the model to provide only one suggestion per predicate.\\nThe response of Command R+ was particularly interesting. The model not only explained the predicate to rename but in some cases it also invented a helper predicate for it.\\nAn example of such behavior is shown in Figure 5 : the model created the helper predicate check_atom_count_recursive for predicate HP19, which was renamed as check_atom_count_recursive . Regardless of the correctness of the suggested name and despite altering the structure of the rule, this suggests the potential of LLMs to directly perform PI .\\nThe reachability case study was generally unchallenging for the majority of models evaluated.\\nSuggestions produced by GPT-5 (direct_connection), Command R+ (is_connected), Gemini (directly_connected), and LLama (is_connected) are all plausible and appropriate, as they generalize a single-step path relation.\\nIn contrast, both FalconMamba and Falcon3 exhibited notable difficulties. FalconMamba generated an output (can reach) that was syntactically invalid as a predicate, due to the inclusion of a space in the identifier, while Falcon 3 failed to produce any answer at all.\\nWe additionally conducted a few-shot prompting experiment with the LLMs that demonstrated lower performance, namely FalconMamba, Falcon3, and Llama, with the goal of improving their answers.\\nWe focused on the math case study, which was selected due to its potential to highlight the benefits of few-shot prompting.\\nIn this experiment, suggestions were requested for one predicate at a time, while also providing the model with the correct names of previously addressed predicates.\\nFigure 6 shows the prompts used in the few-shot prompting experiments with answers from Falcon3. The initial prompt, Prompt 0 , requests the name of only the first predicate ( A ). Then, its answers is used to replace the corresponding unnamed predicate in the following prompt, Prompt 1 , while requesting a suggestion for the second predicate ( P ). This continues until the last prompt, in which all the unnamed predicates of the math case study have been renamed, except of the last one.\\nThis incremental approach aimed to support the model by narrowing its focus and reducing the complexity of the task, in contrast to requiring it to generate names for all predicates simultaneously.\\nHowever, the outcomes did not meet expectations. None of the models showed improved performance in terms of correctly identifying a greater number of names; in some instances, performance even declined.\\nPrompt 0:\\nResponse:\\nPrompt 1:\\nResponse:\\nTable 5 shows the results of this experiment.\\nWith few-shot prompting Falcon3 correctly identified 10 out of 16 predicate names, a decrease from the 12 out of 16 correctly identified with zero-shot prompting.\\nSimilarly, Llama achieved 8 correct predictions with few-shot prompting, compared to 9 without.\\nA substantial improvement was observed with FalconMamba. with zero-shot prompting, the model failed to generate a meaningful output, simply repeating the predicates.\\nIn contrast, when few-shot prompting was applied, the model provided a suggestion for all the predicates, finding 11 correct answers out of 16.\\nThese findings, particularly in the case of FalconMamba, indicate that breaking down the prompt and using few-shot prompting can significantly enhance performance in models that otherwise struggle with zero-shot prompting.\\nRegarding the judgment on the coauthors case study, shown in Table 6 , all the suggestions\\nare plausible. LLM judges seem to prefer a longer and more detailed name, assigning the lowest score to the simplest one, i.e. coauthors .\\nIn Table 7 we report the results of the judgment on the family case study.\\nThe correct name was chosen for each predicate.\\nThe same holds for the grandparent and cousins case studies, both shown in Table 6 .\\nTable 8 shows the results of the judgment on the math case study. Here, the correct name was chosen for all the predicates, except for predicate L. While the correct name is divisor , it was mostly interpreted as “divisible”, which is actually the opposite.\\nRegarding predicates M and N, all the judges recognized the true names, gcd and lcm respectively, even if they didn’t suggest them initially. The strategy of asking multiple models for name suggestions turned out to be effective, as it allowed the judges to identify the correct name when one model suggested it, even when the others did not.\\nThe same cannot be said for the lcm case study, as can be seen in Table 6 . For predicate G, findLeastCommonMultipleIntermediate was chosen as the most fitting name, instead of computeProduct or multiply , which would have been equally correct.\\nSimilarly, for predicate H, computeLcmFromGcd was selected as the most appropriate name, rather than divide or divideValues .\\nTable 9 presents the judgment results for the reachability case study. It is important to note that ChatGPT-5 was used as a substitute for ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o3mini, as these models were no longer available at the time the experiment was conducted.\\nThree out of the four alternatives were selected as the most suitable name, each receiving the same score. This outcome is acceptable, as all three options are considered plausible. Notably, however, only ChatGPT-5 assigned a score of 0 to the proposed name can reach , which is syntactically incorrect. In contrast, both Gemini and Command R+ assigned it a score of 0.5, indicating a limited ability to recognize the syntactic invalidity of the suggestion.\\nAlthough all the proposed alternatives in the coauthors case study\\nare plausible, human judges did not select the most straightforward option for predicate P, that is, coauthors .

For instance, after noticing that the models often provided multiple equivalent suggestions, we decided to limit them to just one.\\nWe also added a constraint to prevent models from altering the structure of the rules, after observing such behaviors with some LLMs . Each of these attempts was executed independently, ensuring that no contextual information was shared between runs. Importantly, the models did not retain any memory of previous executions; in particular, ChatGPT was used with the memory feature explicitly disabled to prevent any persistence of prior interactions. After analyzing the models’ responses and identifying recurring issues or undesired behaviors, we refined our instructions iteratively. The final version of the prompt, shown in Figure 2 , was then used to rerun all experiments from scratch. Additionally, we observed that models sometimes gave the correct response on the first try, while other times they required several attempts. To address this, and given the non-deterministic nature of the answers, we decided to repeat the question a certain number of times to address this issue. In these preliminary experiments, we decided to use three repetitions.\\nAll the models handled the task appropriately, so zero-shot prompting was sufficient in this case. Most of them followed the instructions accurately, with only a few exceptions.\\nFor example, Llama usually wrote a sentence (explaining the reasons for its choices) instead of adopting the requested format.\\nIn such cases, however, the name can be extracted from the answer using basic string manipulation.\\nAfter getting three suggestions out of each model, we asked them to choose only one name among their own ones.\\nTables 1 and 2 show the final choices made by each model for each predicate of each case study; we also report for each LLM how many of the suggested names could be considered correct. Table 3 provides a summary of the number of correct name suggestions per predicate. Each model receives a score of 1 if its final suggestion matches the expected name, and 0 otherwise. In the final column, we indicate how many LLMs correctly named each predicate.

However, current approaches do not seem to address this issue, with invented predicates typically being left unnamed.\\nA possible solution is to use placeholders and select names from a predefined pool ( [ 12 ] ), but this would require knowing beforehand which predicates should be invented and their arity, which is not always feasible.\\nWhile all the predicates could be renamed manually, our approach showed promising results in accomplishing this task automatically.\\nEven though the involvement of LLMs in logic is still not much investigated, the experiments show that this method was effective in most of the tested cases, even without providing specific contexts or examples. In fact, zero-shot prompting was sufficient, as the LLMs immediately understood their task. This is particularly convenient when extensive computing power to fine-tune models is not easily accessible, as models for general-purpose tasks, trained on common knowledge data and code can still perform the task ( [ 88 ] ).\\nThere are several limitations to this early-stage approach.\\nThe main one is the use of relatively simple examples. The rules express common knowledge and typical relationships, which the models may have already seen in the LP codes they have been trained on. Nonetheless, this initial step was necessary to assess whether LLMs could correctly process them; otherwise, their ability to grasp even more specific relationships would have seemed unlikely.\\nDespite the simplicity of the examples, we encountered several challenges throughout the process.\\nOne issue is that, at times, some models fail to follow the request or the output format, which complicates the automation of the entire process.\\nFor instance, in some preliminary experiments, we noticed that some models also altered the body of the rule, even if instructed to find a name for the head predicate. This is not desirable, as it could completely change the meaning of the logic theory, which is assumed to be correct. That is why we decided to add “Do NOT change the body of the rules” to the instructions.\\nAnother constraint, “Give only ONE suggestion for each predicate.”, was added to the prompt to limit the number of suggestions. While one could argue that this might cause the potentially correct answer to be overlooked, we addressed this concern by repeating the request multiple times.\\nWhen this behavior persisted, we decided to disregard that particular answer for that specific predicate. Even if one answer is discarded, the presence of multiple models offering suggestions reduces the impact of this issue.\\nModels also struggled to recognize that some names, despite being written in different formats, were conceptually equivalent (e.g., lessThan , less_than , LessThan ), even when explicitly instructed to treat them as equal. As a result, it was necessary to manually standardize these names, to ensure that they were evaluated as the same. The issue persists to some extent: singular and plural forms are considered different (e.g., cousins and cousin ), as well as names that include a verb or particle (e.g., isEqual or equalTo ).\\nLastly, this approach was unsuccessful when tested on predicates from a real-world dataset, Mutagenesis.\\nIt should be noted that nearly all of the predicates’ true names were masked, which significantly hindered the models’ ability to identify them and grasp the relationship between them. However, such a scenario is highly unlikely, if not entirely unrealistic, since it would mean that the background knowledge is almost empty. In this case, inferring a set of meaningful rules would be highly difficult for any ML model.\\nNevertheless, our findings hint that domain-specific fine-tuning might be necessary for real-world applications ( [ 69 ] ), provided that enough computational resources are available.

Based on the results obtained from some hand-crafted sets of rules, LLMs appear to be a promising solution to this problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address this issue.\\nThe limitations of this study are primarily related to the examples we used, and investigating more complex scenarios is an interesting future work. We believe that the suitability of the proposed names is primarily determined by the context and semantics of the program and thus developed an approach that is independent of the language. Nevertheless, differences in language-specific conventions may play a role, and investigating this aspect could offer further insights into the generalization ability of LLM-based renaming approaches. Another topic worth exploring is the use of fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific naming suggestions, as well as the development of quantized versions that can run locally on machines with lower processing power.\\nFuture research could also consider the potential of LLMs for directly performing PI and their application to other approaches such as Learning From Interpretation Transitions (LFIT) ( [ 70 ] ) to reduce the number of rules.',\n",

      "1 Introduction: Graph-based agent planning enables parallel and serial tool execution through explicit task dependency modeling, improving agent efficiency and generalization.\n",
      "2 Background: The paper introduces the ReAct-style approach, leveraging few-shot exemplars to guide an LLM through a “Thought-Action-Observation” cycle, interleaving reasoning traces, tool use, and observation. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enhances LLMs’ code reasoning by integrating natural language with external tool execution environments, maintaining a global state and selecting tools via a policy.\n",
      "3 Graph-based Agent Planning Paradigm: GAP introduces a framework for LLM-based agents to plan complex tasks by representing them as a directed acyclic graph. The agent decomposes queries into sub-tasks, models dependencies, and dynamically selects tools to maximize efficiency and correctness. The model constructs a dependency graph, generates parallel tool calls, and partitions the graph into execution levels to enable parallel task execution.\n",
      "4 Training Pipeline: The paper details a supervised fine-tuning pipeline using GPT-4o to generate Graph-based Action Planning (GAP) trajectories from Natural Questions and HotpotQA datasets. Data quality was filtered through complexity, diversity, and length constraints, resulting in approximately 7,000 high-quality trajectories. Fine-tuning focuses on optimizing policy parameters through end-to-end reinforcement learning, balancing parallel exploration and context window constraints, using a graph-based reward function and rule-based metrics.\n",
      "5 Experiments: Seven benchmark datasets were selected for evaluation, including general question answering, trivia, popQA, multi-hop QA, and multimodal QA. GAP outperformed baseline methods on HotpotQA, achieving 0.9% improvement and a 33.4% reduction in execution time. It demonstrates strong multi-hop reasoning through parallel decomposition, reducing interaction turns and execution time, and autonomously determines parallelizability, generalizing across domains.\n",
      "6 Conclusion: GAP (Graph-based Agent Planning) is a new paradigm that improves LLM-based agents' reasoning and tool execution through explicit task dependency modeling. It achieves better efficiency and accuracy by autonomously decomposing queries into dependency graphs and parallel tool execution. GAP outperforms traditional sequential baselines, especially on multi-step retrieval tasks.\n",

Recent work, including Chain-of-Agents and Cognitive Kernel-Pro, highlights the importance of training quality and architectural innovation for creating capable agents, even with smaller models, and showcases that even models at smaller scales can rival larger systems on benchmarks like GAIA and WebArena.\n",

      "1 Introduction: PsyCoTalk is a large-scale dialogue dataset designed for comorbidity diagnosis, utilizing synthetic social media posts transformed into structured EMRs to train a three-agent diagnostic system. It includes 502 synthetic EMRs representing common comorbid conditions and provides a clinically grounded multi-agent framework combining a Hierarchical Diagnostic State Machine (HDSM) and Diagnosis Context Tree (DCT) for comprehensive diagnostic reasoning.\n",
      "2 Related Work: Recent datasets include D, PsyQA, EFAQA, and MDD‑5k. LLM-driven dialogue simulation models are used in mental health research, with studies assessing chatbot empathy and tutoring techniques. Multi-agent designs, leveraging the AMC framework, improve clinical grounding and generate dialogues reflecting diagnostic reasoning.\n",
      "3 Patient EMR and Experience Generation Workflow: The PsySym dataset, a scale of 5,624 users with detailed annotations, was selected due to its suitability for modeling psychiatric comorbidity. A user filtering process, based on symptom diversity and frequency, retained users with 102.5 posts per user, ensuring clinical reliability. A modular generation strategy, involving individual section categorization and LLM inference, produced 502 structured EMRs, covering six psychiatric conditions.  The dataset includes structured information on demographic data, medical history, personal history, family history, and preliminary diagnosis, alongside a comparison with de-identified clinical records, revealing a broad alignment of disease prevalence with real-world data.  A personalized fictitious experience generation method, leveraging LLMs, was proposed to enhance dialogue diversity and realism, ensuring semantic coherence and diagnostic validity.\n",
      "4 Multi-agent Diagnosis Framework: The framework utilizes a hierarchical diagnostic state machine (HDSM) and diagnostic context tree (DCT) to guide dialogue, incorporating structured clinical interview data, dynamic dialogue generation, and a knowledge graph for contextualization. The Patient Agent generates responses based on the EMR, fictitious experience, and tool agent’s topic, while the Doctor Agent poses questions based on the topic, utilizing five distinct profiles. The Tool Agent manages dialogue flow, ensuring clinical relevance and coherence through tree management and dialogue coordination, incorporating a Disease–Symptom Description Knowledge Graph for hallucination filtering and personalized templates.\n",
      "5 Final Product: PsyCoTalk Dataset: PsyCoTalk Dataset Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "The dataset comprises 502 structured EMRs from PsyCoProfile, generating five distinct fictitious experiences and paired with five personal histories. These FEDs are then used to create 3,000 dialogues, selected to form the PsyCoTalk dataset. Evaluation involves two stages: human evaluation by psychiatrists with experience and an AB test comparing PsyCoTalk with existing datasets.  The dataset statistics demonstrate PsyCoTalk’s scale and structural fidelity, exceeding other corpora in terms of dialogue length and turn count.  The study assesses dialogue diversity and validates cross-lingual generalization through a small-scale English generation experiment, comparing with existing corpora.  Expert evaluation reveals PsyCoTalk excels in communication, professionalism, fluency, and realism, while MDD-5k exhibits overly long utterances and lower accuracy.\n",
      "Limitations: PsyCoTalk’s focus on four prevalent disorders and comorbidities reflects real-world cases but limits coverage of rarer conditions. The dataset remains Chinese, restricting multilingual applicability, but the pipeline is extensible for broader coverage and cross-lingual applications.\n",
      "6 Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper introduces a two-stage pipeline to create a large, clinically standard dataset for psychiatric comorbidity. It first converts social media data into structured electronic medical records and then develops PsyCoTalk, a multi-agent dialogue corpus, to train models for multi-disorder screening.\n",
      "Ethics Statement: The authors have adhered to the ICLR Code of Ethics, ensuring the work does not involve human subjects, identifiable private data, or harmful applications. Data provenance and privacy are addressed through anonymization, synthetic electronic medical records, and rigorous review by licensed psychiatrists, ensuring no re-identification of authors. The dataset is designed for research on multi-disorder screening and dialogue modeling, with a focus on synthetic conversations and limitations regarding potential biases from web data and language models. The release of synthetic dialogues is restricted to a data-usage agreement prohibiting re-identification and clinical deployment, and users are urged to apply rigorous evaluation. The dataset’s potential impact includes positive contributions to early-stage screening and inclusive diagnostic tools, while risks of misuse are mitigated through responsible modeling and evaluation practices.\n",

      "Appendix A Appendix: The appendix details EMR section guidelines based on clinical practice, including demographic data, chief complaint, medical history, and family history. It outlines the structure of the template, emphasizing concise, factual documentation of patient symptoms, medical conditions, and lifestyle factors to assess potential comorbidities. Preliminary diagnoses are provided based on the EMR content. The prompt details for virtual experience generation involves a large language model to create a fictitious narrative based on a patient’s EMR data, using a template sentence derived from the EMR, and selecting from a dictionary of fictitious experiences. The hierarchical diagnostic state taxonomy and topic mapping presents a hierarchical diagnostic state taxonomy and topic mapping, grouping states based on SCID-5 categories: Affective & Cognitive Symptoms, Physiological & Behavioral Changes, Functional Impairment & Risk, and Comorbid or Contributing Factors. Terminal nodes detail the final diagnostic outcomes for each sub-state machine, mirroring real-world psychiatric evaluations. The case study of PsyCoProfile illustrates a 20-24-year-old unmarried female student with a history of major depressive disorder and anxiety, characterized by emotional instability, fatigue, and negative thoughts, with a 28-month progression of symptoms including social withdrawal, panic attacks, sleep disturbances, and compulsive behavior, followed by gradual improvement after psychological intervention. The HDSM framework organizes four psychiatric disorders (MDD, AD, BD, and ADHD) into four independent sub-states. The case study of PsyCoTalk presents a doctor-patient dialogue example generated using a multi-agent interaction framework, simulating a diagnostic process.\n",

      "1 Introduction: This work adapts the Aurora model, initially developed for global atmospheric applications, to subregional ocean prediction, focusing on the Canary Upwelling System. Utilizing data from the GLORYS12V1 ocean prediction system, the model predicts the evolution of SST, salinity, currents, and two-dimensional variables, offering improved computational cost reduction and prediction quality, though limitations remain due to domain complexity.\n",
      "2 Related Work: Deep learning has significantly advanced oceanographic and climate prediction, incorporating satellite data, numerical models, and machine learning techniques. CNNs initially focused on temperature mapping, while GraphCast and Diffusion-based methods leverage graph structures for medium-range forecasting. Transformers enhance spatial and temporal representations, while models like Aurora and Orca improve resolution and accuracy. The development of deep learning frameworks like AIFS and the integration of pre-trained models like Aurora demonstrate advancements in handling heterogeneous data and extreme events.\n",
      "3 Dataset and Study Area: The CMEMS [47] provides a European service offering global and regional oceanic data for scientific analysis, organized into thematic categories including Blue Ocean (physical variables), Green Ocean (biogeochemical variables), and White Ocean (sea ice and polar regions). The GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030 product, a 1/12o spatial resolution, 50 vertical level global physical ocean reanalysis, utilizes the GLORYS12V1 ocean prediction system, integrating satellite data and in situ observations to create a coherent representation of the global ocean environment. The data period covers 1993-2021, enabling analysis of seasonal variations and medium-term trends, and is available in NetCDF format, adhering to CF-1.6 conventions. The study area is limited to the Northeastern Atlantic region near the African coast and Canary Islands, a region characterized by high biological productivity and influence on regional climate, spanning from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2021. The data includes daily and monthly averages of three-dimensional variables (potential temperature, salinity, currents) and surface variables (sea level, sea ice), facilitating analysis of mesoscale variability and seasonal patterns.\n",
      "4 A Foundational Model for Forecasting the SST: This section details the Aurora model, a foundational model for atmospheric forecasting, adapted to oceanographic data. The model utilizes a local window attention mechanism and a 3D Swin Transformer to process heterogeneous data, generating long-term forecasts by iteratively applying a prediction function. The model’s scalability is achieved through parallel training and mixed precision, enabling practical implementation in operational contexts. The encoder transforms raw data into a unified representation, while the processor evolves this representation over time, capturing temporal relationships. The decoder restores the variables to their original resolution and levels, ensuring coherence and physical interpretability. The model’s architecture incorporates multiple configurations, differentiated by parameters and embedding sizes, and is adapted to a medium-sized model, facilitating balance between complexity and computational cost.\n",
      "5 Experimental Configuration: The study split a dataset annually between 2014 and 2018, validating from 2019 to 2020, and testing from 2020 to 2021, maintaining temporal order for studying oceanic phenomena. Data was divided into training (2014-2018), validation (2019), and testing (2020) sets, with a 70/15/15 split. The model used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as a loss function, incorporating weighted variables and spatial dimensions to prioritize relevant data, and utilized weighted metrics for evaluation.\n",
      "6 Results: Here’s a concise summary of the paper’s results:\n",
      "\n",
      "The model was evaluated using a test set, with experiments focusing on fine-tuning, batch size adjustments, and training duration. Results showed improved performance with larger batch sizes (8) and longer training times (30), resulting in an RMSE of 0.134K.  The model captured relationships between anomalies, with an ACC of approximately 0.997, indicating good pattern recognition. Bias values were generally low, with a few exceptions, and the last fine-tuning yielded a significantly lower RMSE.  Inferences from the table and figure 7 demonstrate the model’s ability to handle complex coastal zones, where temperature variations are high and the model struggles with boundary regions.  Further training, incorporating high-resolution data and modeling techniques, could improve performance in these areas.  The long-term forecast results show increasing RMSE with extended time horizons, particularly during summer, highlighting the challenge of maintaining accuracy over extended periods.\n",
      "7 Discussion: This study explores deep learning models for oceanographic forecasting, leveraging prior knowledge and expanding modeling methodologies. While advancements are made, limitations remain regarding computational demands, data representativeness, model interpretability, and the incorporation of physical knowledge. Future research should focus on expanding data sources, enhancing model complexity through physics-informed approaches, and improving spatial resolution through progressive training strategies.\n",
      "8 Conclusion: The study demonstrated the feasibility of adapting the Aurora atmospheric model to oceanographic forecasting by successfully applying it to forecast local ocean temperature. Aurora’s ability to handle oceanic data, differing from atmospheric variables, showcases cross-domain adaptability, suggesting potential for future knowledge transfer.  Further, the model’s sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning and normalization highlights its flexibility for diverse oceanographic applications.\n",

      "1 Introduction: RegionE introduces a training-free framework that reduces spatial and temporal redundancy in IIE models through adaptive region-aware generation and a velocity-decay cache. Experimental results demonstrate significant speedups on Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit, while maintaining PSNR values of 30.520, 32.133, and 31.115, and negligible perceptual differences with GPT-4o.\n",
      "2 Related Work: Efficient diffusion models have been explored with various acceleration techniques, including pruning, quantization, distillation, sparse attention, and early stopping. Researchers have addressed temporal and spatial redundancy through methods like DeepCache, Δ \\Delta -DiT, FORA, TeaCache, and RAS. RegionE leverages IIE's trajectory characteristics, addressing both spatial and temporal redundancies in image editing.  A new IIE model, leveraging textual instructions, offers improved general-purpose editing capabilities.\n",
      "3 Preliminary: Flow Matching & Rectified Flow: The paper introduces a method for training diffusion models by learning a velocity field that guides the generation of images. This involves differentiating the equation d ​ 𝑿 t d ​ t = 𝑿 1 − 𝑿 0 \\frac{d\\bm{X}_{t}}{dt}=\\bm{X}_{1}-\\bm{X}_{0} , which iteratively refines the image. The rectified flow simplifies this process by assuming a linear velocity. The inference process starts with a source distribution and iteratively solves for the target distribution, using the learned velocity.  A discrete Euler sampler is employed for approximation.  The paper focuses on optimizing the inference process for T T iterations, as demonstrated by the Step1X-Edit model.\n",
      "4 Methodology: Here's a summary of the paper's sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a method called RegionE to accelerate the IIE model without additional training. It utilizes three stages: Stabilization, Region-Aware Generation, and Smooth Stage. The Stabilization Stage stabilizes the initial sampling process, while the Region-Aware Generation stage adapts the image to the region, and the Smooth Stage smooths the boundaries between regions. The RegionE method employs a dynamic region partition and adaptive velocity decay to improve efficiency.\n",
      "5 Experiment: RegionE demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods across all evaluation metrics, achieving significant improvements in reconstruction quality, editing evaluation, and efficiency. The ablation studies reveal the importance of different components in the algorithm, validating its architectural agnosticism and providing robust quality validation.\n",
      "6 Conclusion: RegionE is a new generation framework that accelerates the IIE process through temporal and spatial redundancy reduction using ARP, RIKVCache, and AVDCache. Experiments show it achieves significant speedups on Step1X-Edit and FLUX1 Kontext, maintaining minimal bias and quality loss.\n",

      "Appendix B Analysis of Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache: The study analyzes residual caching in diffusion models.  The current residual cache and velocity cache are equivalent, with the coefficient before the velocity cache being less than one.  The solver determines the decay coefficient for the velocity cache, but the decay behavior is timestep-dependent and is corrected by an external coefficient. The AVDCache is reduced to the velocity cache when γ equals 1.\n",

      "1 Introduction: ProFees is an automated CPT E/M coding model developed to address inconsistencies and errors in coding, leveraging a dynamic few-shot prompting strategy, explicit criticism, and self-consistency techniques. It improves accuracy, efficiency, and transparency in E/M coding, demonstrating superior performance compared to commercial systems and a baseline model through empirical testing on a proprietary test dataset.\n",
      "2 Related Work: This paper reviews related work on CPT coding, highlighting the limitations of classical machine learning models in handling clinical narratives and the potential of large language models (LLMs) to improve coding accuracy. It discusses the challenges of using deep learning models for CPT coding, citing limited success compared to classical ML approaches. The paper then introduces a systematic framework for developing LLM-based CPT E/M coding, acknowledging its nascent stage of development.\n",
      "3 Task Overview: The paper analyzes CPT E/M coding accuracy, focusing on outpatient and preventive medicine encounters. The process involves assessing MDM levels based on patient visit complexity, data review, and risk factors, using a 2-out-of-3 rule. Strict exact-match accuracy is prioritized, as payers handle code denials and adjustments, impacting reimbursement. Near-miss codes have operational and financial implications, while systematic overcoding and undercoding create risks despite potential revenue gains.\n",
      "4 The ProFees Model: The ProFees model utilizes an LLM-based classifier and self-critics to predict encounter type and MDM level from clinical data, incorporating retrieval-augmented prompting, recursive self-critique, and rule-based logic. It enhances contextual relevance through a VDB of curated justifications and reasoning steps, ensuring guideline compliance and reducing hallucination. The model achieves high accuracy, explainability, and alignment with clinical workflows, fostering trust and deployment.\n",
      "5 Data Gathering and Annotation: We collected 216 real-world encounters from hospital production databases, using a larger dataset with coarse-level CPT labels as a reference. An internal medical expert annotated the E/M code and MDM element complexity for each encounter, using a finer-grained dataset. A high degree of disagreement between coders existed, with 52 agreements and 65 disagreements, resulting in a partitioned development dataset of Platinum and Disagreement subsets.\n",
      "6 Evaluation and Results: We combine Platinum and Disagreement subsets with 117 encounters, using them as a tuning dataset for both ProFees and baseline models. A Test dataset of 99 encounters was used for evaluation. The VDB was constructed with development and test datasets, employing a leave-one-out strategy and semantic dense retrieval with 3 N=3 exemplars. The study compared against System A (commercial tool) and four single-prompt variants, varying context and prompting strategies. Accuracy-based evaluation was performed at different granularity levels, with standard deviation reported across 5 runs. The intermediate complexity prediction was not available for System A, and the number of predictions per test encounter was set to 3, with a temperature of 0. The full model (Few-Shot + RCI) achieves the highest CPT accuracy (36.85% higher than System A), significantly surpassing the single prompt baseline (33.73% higher) and the single prompt baseline by 4.73%. RCI enhances MDM accuracy by 4% in the few-shot setting and 2.33% in the zero-shot setting, confirming the value of structured self-critique. The full model outperforms the strongest baseline on MDM, PC, DC, and RC accuracy by 8-17 absolute points, demonstrating its efficacy. A detailed ablation study is available in Appendix B.\n",
      "7 Conclusion and Future Work: This study presents a production-oriented automated CPT coding system using a modular architecture. The model improves CPT accuracy by 4.73% and outperforms commercial software by 30.61%. Future work includes expanding to multiple codes, CPT modifiers, and synthetic dataset generation.\n",
      "Limitations: ProFees currently predicts a single CPT E/M code per encounter. The team plans to expand this to support multiple codes, including preventive medicine visits, and will leverage an extended Encounter Type Classifier.  They are also creating a synthetic dataset to enhance model development and research.\n",
      "Ethical Considerations: Ethical considerations include privacy and data integrity (HIPAA-compliant development), accountability and liability (as an assistive tool, not autonomous), algorithmic biases and fairness (mitigated through synthetic data), interpretability and transparency (through multi-step reasoning and rationales), automation bias (risk of human reliance), and human oversight (UI/UX design for review).\n",

      "1 Introduction: Research into non-learning-based decision-making algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), is an active field. MCTS can be used for applications where a general on-the-fly decision-making algorithm is needed, such as Game Studios which rarely use Machine Learning (ML) based AI as they would have to be retrained whenever the game rules are modified (e.g. during development or patches). One way to improve MCTS is to reduce the search space by grouping states and actions in the current MCTS search tree to enable intra-layer information flow (Jiang et al., 2014; Anand et al., 2015; 2016). One key strength of one of the state-of-the-art abstraction algorithms On the Go Abstractions in Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) (Anand et al., 2016) is its exactness in the sense that if OGA-UCT groups two state-action pairs in a search tree where all possible successors of each state-action pair have been sampled, only state-action pairs are grouped that have the same Q ∗ Q^{*} value, i.e., they have the same value under subsequent optimal play. This exactness condition, however, comes at the cost that state or state-action pairs that only differ slightly in their Q ∗ Q^{*} value cannot be detected. This issue was slightly alleviated with the introduction of ( ε a , ε t ) (\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}},\\varepsilon_{\\text{t}}) -OGA (Schmöcker et al., 2025c) , which is equivalent to ( ε a , 0 ) (\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}},0) -OGA in deterministic environments that allows for small errors in the immediate reward or transition function when building an abstraction. However, this also brings two downsides with it. Firstly, it introduces two parameters, which makes tuning harder, and secondly, grouping non-value equivalent state-action pairs might even be harmful to the performance, as they can make convergence to the optimal action impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this work, we propose Known Value Differences Abstractions UCT (KVDA-UCT), that relaxes the strict abstraction conditions of OGA-UCT to detect almost as many abstractions as ( ε a , 0 ) (\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}},0) -OGA in deterministic environments but without losing the exactness condition. The novel idea that makes this possible is to deliberately group states or state-action pairs that do not have the same value if we know the difference between their values which is inferred by analysis of the search tree’s immediate rewards. When the abstractions are used, instead of averaging state-action pair values directly, their difference-accounted values are averaged. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "1. We introduce the Known-Value-Difference (KVDA) abstraction framework that extends the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework used by OGA-UCT. Fig. 1 is an example of a simple state-transition graph in which KVDA finds three non-trivial abstractions, while ASAP would detect none.\n",
      "2. We propose and empirically evaluate KVDA-UCT, a modification of OGA-UCT that introduces no parameters and uses and builds KVDA abstractions. We show that KVDA-UCT outperforms OGA-UCT in most of the here-considered deterministic environments. We also compare KVDA-UCT with ( ε a , 0 ) (\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}},0) -OGA and show that it either performs equally well or better than a parameter-optimized ( ε a , 0 ) (\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}},0) -OGA agent.\n",
      "3. We also consider the stochastic setting where we generalize KVDA-UCT to ε t \\ ε_{\\text{t}} -KVDA which allows for errors in the transition function when building the abstraction. Furthermore, we compare it to ( ε t , ε a ) (\\varepsilon_{\\text{t}},\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}}) -OGA and show that, unlike in the deterministic setting, KVDA rarely performs better than ( ε t , ε a ) (\\varepsilon_{\\text{t}},\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}}) -OGA in stochastic environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, the theoretical groundwork for automatic state and state-action pair abstractions is laid. In particular, we define OGA-UCT and ( ε a , ε t ) (\\varepsilon_{\\text{a}},\\varepsilon_{\\text{t}}) -OGA. Then, in Section 3, our novel KVDA framework and both KVDA-UCT and ε t \\ ε_{\\text{t}} -KVDA are introduced. Afterwards, in Section 4, the experimental setup is defined, then in Section 5, the experimental results using this setup are shown and discussed. The paper is concluded by a discussion of the limitations of KVDA-UCT and avenues for future work in Section 6 .\n",
      "2 Foundations of automatic abstractions: Here’s a concise summary of the provided text:\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper introduces the theoretical foundations for automatic abstraction, focusing on the use of finite Markov Decision Processes (Sutton & Barto) as a model for sequential decision-making. It details the concept of state-action pairs (ASAPs) and the goal of identifying equivalent states and action pairs to improve MCTS efficiency through intra-layer information flow. The paper then discusses the Abstraction of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework, which iteratively constructs state abstractions and state-action pair abstractions, employing a recursive process to converge to a stable solution.  It also explores related research on automatic abstraction of transition functions, including techniques like pruning and refinement.\n",
      "3 Method: This section details the KVDA framework, which builds abstractions by grouping states and action pairs based on difference functions. The KVDA-UCT algorithm integrates this framework into MCTS, utilizing a modified search tree approach. The framework focuses on detecting more abstractions than ASAP, allowing for subtraction of differences during aggregation, and incorporates a representation of the state-action difference for improved decision-making.\n",
      "4 Experiment setup: This section details the experimental setup for evaluating KVDA-UCT against OGA-UCT in a variety of MDPs. The experiments were conducted on a diverse set of MDPs, including those from the International Probabilistic Planning Conference (Grzes et al., 2014), board games, and commonly used abstraction algorithm literature.  The MDPs were initially stochastic but were subsequently transformed into dense-reward MDPs through deterministic One-Step-Lookahead agents, with a heuristic V h V^{\\text{h}} defined for each board game.  The problem domains have varying reward scales, and the dynamic exploration factor Global Std (Schmöcker et al., 2025d) is used to control the exploration process.  The recency counter K = 3 K=3 is employed, and the evaluation process involves repeated runs with 99% confidence intervals of approximately 2 ⋅ 2.33.  The normalized pairings score, calculated as the average of the first row of the matrix, is used for generalization testing. The implementation is released with the code compiled with g++ version 13.1.0 and the -O3 flag.\n",
      "5 Experiments: This section presents experimental results for KVDA-UCT across various settings, including comparisons to OGA-UCT, deterministic environments, and stochastic environments. KVDA-UCT demonstrates superior performance in deterministic settings, outperforming OGA-UCT and other methods, particularly in environments like SysAdmin and Wildfire.  KVDA-UCT detects more abstractions than OGA-UCT, and it outperforms all competitors in some environments, including those with multiple iterations.  The parameter-optimized KVDA-UCT achieves better performance than standard OGA-UCT, and the performance of KVDA-UCT is stable across different iteration budgets.  The study also investigates the generalization capabilities of KVDA-UCT, demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse environments.\n",
      "6 Conclusion, Limitations and Future Work: This paper evaluated KVDA-UCT against OGA-UCT and (ε a, 0) -OGA, demonstrating its superior generalization and parameter-optimized performance in deterministic settings.  It found limited success in stochastic settings, specifically with KVDA-UCT to ε t ε_{\\text{t}} -OGA, which outperforms both. Future work will focus on understanding the stochastic performance limitations and extending KVDA to multi-player games.\n",

      "Appendix A Supplementary Materials: This paper presents a comparative analysis of KVDA-UCT performance against OGA-UCT using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for 100 and 2000 iterations. KVDA-UCT demonstrates improved convergence speed compared to the baseline algorithm, with a median runtime overhead of less than 1% for 100 iterations and approximately 1% for 2000 iterations. The paper details the performance of the UCT algorithm, the UCB tree policy, and the heuristic functions for Connect 4, Constrictor, and Othello, utilizing parameter-optimized KVDA-UCT for the experiments. The presented results highlight the effectiveness of the MCTS approach and the impact of parameter adjustments on convergence speed.\n",

      "1 INTRODUCTION: Here’s a summary of the paper’s sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction: Generative models, like LLMs, are prone to errors, requiring careful assessment. The example illustrates a failure of the LLM in a math problem, prompting research into post-hoc error assessment. This work proposes e-scores as a data-dependent measure of incorrectness, addressing the limitations of p-value-based conformal prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 2: Background and Related Work: This section provides context on LLM outputs, error assessment, and existing methods like p-value-based conformal prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 3: Definitions and Methodology: The paper defines e-scores, explains the e-value concept, and outlines the experimental setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 4: e-Score Definition and Practical Evaluation: The paper details the e-score methodology, including the calculation of e-values and practical demonstration of its efficacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 5: Experimental Results: The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of e-scores in mathematical factuality and property constraint satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 6: Theoretical Analysis: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the e-score concept, including the generalization to various generative models and response sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 7: Conclusion: The paper concludes with remarks on the problem and the proposed solution.\n",
      "2 PROBLEM FORMULATION: We define the prompt space 𝒳 \\mathcal{X} as a sub-space of language, and define the (in)correctness of generative model outputs as a measure of their correctness, utilizing a post-hoc statistical guarantee of the generated outputs.  The paper introduces a method for assessing the correctness of LLM responses, focusing on factuality and property constraints satisfaction, and defines a labeled response set.  The desideratum is to provide a score reflecting the user's tolerance level, with a ratio of error observation to tolerance level expected to be at most 1.\n",
      "3 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK: Here's a concise summary of the provided text:\n",
      "\n",
      "This work reviews recent research on post-hoc significance testing for generative models, drawing on previous work on p-values and e-values. It highlights adaptations of conformal prediction techniques, particularly in the context of filtering LLM outputs to construct response sets. The authors aim to develop a scoring system that generalizes across different generative models and response sets, extending beyond the results of previous studies.\n",
      "4 E-SCORES: We propose e-scores that compare test responses to incorrect calibration responses, utilizing a function f ∗ f^{*} to approximate the oracle o. These e-scores are defined as the maximum incorrect response value, and are calibrated to the oracle o. The e-scores are derived from Gammerman et al. [1998] and are influenced by the non-conformity functions in Mohri and Hashimoto [2024]; Cherian et al. [2024]; Rubin-Toles et al. [2025].  The oracle estimator o ^ \\hat{o} approximates the oracle o o, a binary classification problem, and is trained to predict the probability of correctness, with a range of [0, 1] [0, 1].  The data used for training should be independent of test and calibration data.  The estimator operates at the response-level y, where y = (y1, y2, ...) and a response consists of multiple sub-responses y = (y1, y2, ...) .  To translate to a response-level prediction, it multiplies conditional probabilities.\n",
      "5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed e-scores with two experimental use-cases. We discuss the use-cases individually and summarize the observed trends collectively. We begin by stating the baselines, the metrics for comparisons, the time and memory complexities, and the experimental setup. We perform a worst-case analysis in Appendix ˜ B, where α \\alpha is chosen to maximize the size distortion in Eq. ˜ 3 . We compare against p-value based scores, or p-scores . Analogous to our e-scores in Eq. ˜ 4 , the p-scores can be defined as the corresponding p-values, comparing the test response value to the incorrect calibration response values as relative ranks [Shafer and Vovk, 2008 ; Vovk et al., 2022a ] . Mohri and Hashimoto [ 2024 ]; Cherian et al. [ 2024 ]; Rubin-Toles et al. [ 2025 ] use such p-scores implicitly to achieve Eq. ˜ 2 , which we make explicit in Appendix ˜ C . Due to the reliance on relative ranks, the choice of the transformed oracle estimator in Eq. ˜ 5 does not matter, as they are monotonically increasing transformations of each other. We also compare against the transformed oracle estimators in Eq. ˜ 5 directly, without conversion to e-/p-scores. These naive scores generally do not come with any statistical guarantees by themselves. We will use them for our worst-case analysis in Appendix ˜ B . Our comparisons are based on the following. Size distortion. This is the most important metric, from our desideratum in Eq. ˜ 3 . We report its empirical mean, which is expected to be ≤ 1 \\leq 1 . Error vs. α \\alpha . While we aim to control size distortion, the expected error to α \\alpha ratio, one might also be interested in the expected error and expected α \\alpha individually. We report both empirical means. Precision vs. recall. We provide guarantees around the inclusion of an incorrect response. Simultaneouly, we want to experimentally validate that we do not exclude too many correct responses. For this reason, we report the empirical means of precision (fraction of correct responses among the ones filtered) and recall (fraction of correct responses that are filtered). We use the precision-recall curve for comparisons, where higher is better for both.\n",

      "6 THEORETICAL RESULTS: We generalize Eq. 8 to a super-set of responses, encompassing previously discussed response sets.  The largest set to consider when a single generated response is presented is the proposed super-set. Alternatives include sub-sets based on use-case, while maintaining guarantees. Eq. 1 is used as a benchmark for this super-set.  The worst-case analysis reveals that the size distortion, defined as α α maximizes, is minimized when α is set to the smallest value such that the indicator function evaluates to 1. This simplifies to a requirement that the score is ≤ α ≤ α, ensuring the indicator function is 1.  The worst-case size distortion is then reduced to the difference between the minimum score and the required score to be 0, which is equivalent to the expression (min(y, c) ∈ 𝕆 ​ (x, g π ​ ( x ) ) : c = 0 ⁡ s ​ ( x , 𝐲 ) ) − 1.  This is an e-value, as defined by exchangeable data, and thus satisfies Eq. 3 under this worst-case setting.  Therefore, the proposed e-scores in Eqs. 4 and 6 provide a bound on the size distortion, as in Eq. 3, when the test and calibration prompts are exchangeable.\n",
      "7 CONCLUSIONS: We propose e-scores, based on e-values, to achieve post-hoc guarantees for generative model outputs. Experiments demonstrate these e-scores provide flexibility in tolerance levels and extend to large response sets, with the choice of oracle estimator impacting the results.  The use of pre-trained models offers a starting point, with potential for further training for specific use cases to enhance e-scores.  Koning [2024] discusses alternative error estimation candidates.\n",
      "Appendix A THEORETICAL RESULTS: The proposed e-scores in Eq. ˜ 4 upper bound the size distortion by 1, as in Eq. ˜ 3, due to the exchangeability assumption.  The worst-case size distortion simplifies to a maximum value achieved by setting α to the smallest value such that the indicator function evaluates to 1, yielding a value of 0.  The derivation of Theorem ˜ 1 involves re-stating the theorem and using the definition of the proposed e-scores.  The worst-case size distortion is bounded by the worst-case scenario, where the equality (i) (i) is achieved by setting α to the smallest value such that the indicator function evaluates to 1, resulting in a value of 0.  The exchangeability assumption allows for a simplified analysis, and the combined e-scores in Eq. ˜ 6 are used to further bound the size distortion.\n",
      "Appendix B EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: The study analyzes worst-case size distortion using a uniform random sample, recovering p-scores as a special case. Randomized p-values correspond to exact p-values, while the reciprocal of the transformed oracle estimators provide a naive score, which is conservative and excludes correct and incorrect responses. The proposed e-scores reliably upper bound the worst-case distortion by 1, verifying the theory.\n",
      "Appendix C IMPLICIT P-SCORES IN RELATED WORKS: The paper presents a method to determine if a work is closely related to the current work by computing calibration values and using p-scores to identify works with similar calibration values. This approach achieves a threshold based on the user-defined alpha, and returns a filtered set of works if the calibration value exceeds this threshold.\n",

      "1. Introduction: This study investigates user misconceptions about conversational LLM-based programming tools, focusing on features like web access, model knowledge, and runtime limitations. Analysis of 500 Python conversations reveals misconceptions regarding these aspects, particularly during debugging and when prompting for code generation. The research aims to inform design choices to improve user understanding of these tools’ capabilities.\n",
      "2. Related Work: Related work explores the tendency for over-trust in automated systems, particularly within programming contexts, and highlights the user-synthesizer gap. Previous studies suggest that less experienced programmers exhibit greater overconfidence in automated feedback, while user studies demonstrate a propensity for misusing AI-aided tools. Neural-network-based tools present a significant challenge for users due to opaque rules, sensitivity to prompt variations, and reliance on training data, compounded by LLMs' potential for fabrication. Computer science education literature also identifies programmer misconceptions about computers and systems as a target for intervention.\n",
      "3. Research Method: This study investigates user misconceptions regarding LLM-based programming tools, defining them as incorrect beliefs about tool affordances. It employs a brainstorming activity and a qualitative analysis of the WildChat dataset, focusing on conversational interactions with a “vibe coding” assistant to identify potential misconceptions across providers and assistant versions. The study acknowledges limitations due to the indirect method and inference-based approach to misperception identification.\n",
      "4. Misconceptions Brainstorming: This paper explores user misconceptions about LLM-based conversational assistants, focusing on data storage, retrieval, and interaction methods. Users frequently assume databases, keyword lookup, or training data-driven approaches, leading to confusion about how these tools operate. Misconceptions center on knowledge base availability, session memory, and the model’s knowledge cutoff, impacting the reliability of LLM-based software library questions. The paper also addresses LLM misconceptions concerning hallucinations, meta-information, and the model’s context window size, highlighting challenges in interpreting responses and the predictability of outputs.\n",
      "5. Qualitative Analysis of Conversational Logs: The WildChat dataset, comprising over 1 million conversations, focuses on programming-related interactions with a free chatbot. Analysis reveals Python, Java, SQL, and JavaScript are prevalent languages, with Python being the most common (23,353).  The study identifies misconceptions through open coding, filtering conversations based on code block formatting and language tags. A codebook was developed for conversational LLM interactions, focusing on potential misconceptions and user intent. Cohen’s Kappa was used to assess inter-rater reliability, with a Gold dataset of 50 conversations created to ensure a robust analysis.\n",
      "6. Results: 6.1. Programming-Related Conversations: Annotators identified “generate code” as the most frequent intention, followed by “debugging” involving help-seeking behavior and varied information about program issues (errors, traceback, message details). Code validation and brainstorming were also common.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2. Results of Labeling Misconceptions: The labeling of misconceptions yielded inconsistent inter-rater reliability, with a low level of agreement among annotators after multiple rounds of coding. Common causes included difficult language, copy-paste homework instructions, and the tendency of the codebook to flag plausible misconceptions. Despite disagreements, the Gold dataset’s codebook demonstrated reasonable consistency in identifying misconceptions, with some cases exhibiting strong consensus among annotators.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3. High-Agreement Misconceptions: The chatbot struggled to generate functional programs due to a lack of specific dataset details, requiring diverse interaction styles including coding, data analysis, and model optimization. It misinterpreted requests for non-text output, including code execution tasks and data analysis requests, and exhibited a tendency to accept code snippets as solutions. The model recognized a previous session reference and responded to a homework assignment, while also handling requests to use the latest versions of libraries and APIs, reflecting a focus on continuous training.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.4. Potential But Unconfirmed Misconceptions: Here’s a concise summary of the paper’s sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "During review of conversation logs, users frequently request the removal of all bugs from programs, expecting automated bug fixing. Users also seek code that doesn’t produce errors and may ask for code to resolve previously discussed bugs. The model’s limited ability to provide solutions due to lack of dynamic information, such as traceback messages, and the potential for scenarios where debugging information cannot be obtained, leads to user expectations regarding optimization requests. Users also frequently request code modifications, particularly for longer programs, and the model’s default behavior suggests a trust in reliably reproducing the entire program, despite the context window limitations.\n",
      "7. Discussion: Here’s a concise summary of the section:\n",
      "\n",
      "The discussion highlights that users frequently misunderstand the affordances of LLM-assisted tools due to misconceptions about tool-level differences and the inherent complexity of LLM models. The WildChat dataset revealed user confusion regarding web access, code execution, and context window limitations, suggesting a need for clearer communication about available features. Users may attempt to infer system commands, but these are unreliable. The model card for the underlying models, particularly OpenAI’s API, offers a potential solution by providing clear labeling of features, while the WildChat creators note GPT-4’s self-identification as GPT-3 due to its training data cut-off, necessitating explicit communication through alternative channels.\n",
      "8. Limitations: Several threats to validity exist, including biased data due to authors’ backgrounds and positionality, a non-representative WildChat dataset (users likely from the IT community), imperfect inferring user intentions from interaction logs, and the dataset’s age (collection ended in May 2024).  Future usefulness may be limited as conversational LLM tools have evolved.\n",
      "9. Conclusions: Based on the research, further studies should focus on surveying users about specific tool affordances, scaling user log data with automated detection using an LLM, and conducting interviews/open-ended surveys to explore misconceptions.  Additional research should examine how users react to LLM tool responses during debugging sessions and utilize behavioral experiments to measure sensitivity to LLM properties.  The rapid evolution of LLM capabilities, tool availability, and user literacy necessitates developing generalizable theories about user assumptions.\n",

      "I Introduction: Diffusion-based generative model demonstrates improved reconstruction accuracy and stability compared to deterministic supervised networks, particularly in challenging scenarios involving noise and calibration errors. The physics-informed validation ensures physically consistent solutions, enhancing robustness and generalization to real-world MWI data.\n",
      "II Methodology: Diffusion models approximate a target distribution by iteratively adding noise and removing it. Sampling involves denoising back to a clean sample, utilizing a neural network to approximate the score function. The model’s flexibility makes it suitable for inverse problems, leveraging a Bayesian framework to sample from a posterior distribution combining a learned score function with the physics of the measurement process.\n",
      "III Results: The latent diffusion model was trained on synthetic data from DataSet1 and subsequently evaluated using unseen synthetic samples differing in position and orientation from the training set. The model consistently reproduced the target permittivity distribution with minimal reconstruction error, demonstrating its stability and robustness to stochastic variation in the sampling process. 100 candidate permittivity maps were generated, and the final reconstruction yielded the lowest mean squared error between predicted and ground-truth scattered fields, indicating a close match in both material properties and electromagnetic behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "To identify the best reconstruction, the diffusion model generated 100 candidate permittivity maps, each evaluated using a forward electromagnetic solver to compute the corresponding scattered fields. The choice of 100 reconstructions was arbitrary and could be adjusted based on the time or computational constraints of each application. The selected reconstruction yielded the lowest mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and ground-truth scattered fields, indicating a close match in both material properties and resulting electromagnetic behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model was subsequently evaluated on experimental scattered-field measurements from DataSet1. The model achieved promising reconstruction performance, successfully recovering key structural features from previously unseen experimental samples. Although the reconstructed permittivity maps were less accurate than those obtained when testing synthetic data, the results demonstrate the model's capacity to adapt to experimental measurements, even though it was trained solely on synthetic data.\n",
      "\n",
      "This generalization result is notable given the significant differences between synthetic and experimental measurements, particularly for the near-field electromagnetic imaging system from which the experimental data was obtained [ 45 ]. Near-field systems, especially those utilizing co-resident antennas, exhibit field behaviors that can differ significantly from the fields generated using, necessarily approximate, computational models. For example, the synthetic training data was generated using the incident fields of idealized point sources (line-soures) and the received fields were simply taken to be scattered fields at precise point-locations. In contrast, the experimental data was collected as microwave scattering parameters (S-parameters) at the antenna ports. An antenna effectively integrates the spatially varying fields across its aperture. In addition, the mutual-coupling with nonactive antennas is ignored in the synthetically generated data. Despite these discrepancies, our ML model was able to deliver strong reconstruction performance. Of course, this is partly due to the scattered-field calibration procedure that was implemented [ 46 , 45 ] . Incorporating the calibration procedure into a machine learning model of its own has been attempted in the past and is a research subject of the greatest importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model was re-trained using this newly generated dataset and tested on previously unseen samples. Representative reconstructions and their corresponding ground-truth targets are shown in Figure 7 . As expected, the inverse problem associated with this more complex, multi-object dataset presents increased difficulty compared to Dataset 1, but the model successfully reconstructed the underlying permittivity distributions, effectively capturing both the global structure and spatial organization of the objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further enhance the model’s capacity to learn the mapping between scattered-field measurements and corresponding permittivity distributions, we investigated the integration of multi-frequency data. Specifically, scattered-field measurements were acquired at five frequencies: 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 GHz. Figure 8 illustrates the model’s performance when conditioned on multi-frequency data, demonstrating improved reconstruction consistency and sharper structural recovery across test samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results indicate that while the single-frequency model occasionally struggles to accurately reconstruct the shapes of closely spaced or sharp-edged objects—sometimes confusing U-shaped targets with hollow circles (see rows 2 and 4 of Fig. 7 )—the multi-frequency model performs substantially better. By leveraging additional frequency-domain information, it accurately resolves fine structural details and preserves object boundaries even in complex spatial configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "This improvement is quantitatively reflected in the last two rows of Table I , where the average MSE image \\text{MSE}_{\\text{image}} values for the multi-frequency case decrease to approximately one-third of the single-frequency error. The averages were computed over 10 test cases, with each case reconstructed 100 times to select the best reconstruction based on the MSE data \\text{MSE}_{\\text{data}} .\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings highlight the potential of incorporating richer physical information—beyond frequency diversity—to improve data representation and model robustness. Future research will explore additional labeled datasets encompassing a more comprehensive set of composite scattering targets to further enhance the model’s capacity for accurate and stable inversion in challenging electromagnetic imaging scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV Conclusion: This work presents a physics-informed diffusion model for microwave inverse scattering, accurately reconstructing complex permittivity distributions from synthetic data and successfully recovering key structural features from experimental scattered-field measurements. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved reconstruction error and generalization across diverse measurement domains, and incorporates a diverse synthetic dataset to enhance robustness.  The autoencoder component contributed to increased reconstruction error, which was addressed through hyperparameter tuning.\n",

      "1 Introduction: This work introduces a theoretical framework for counterfactual reasoning in cyclic causal models, utilizing shift-scale interventions. It demonstrates the uniqueness of simple cyclic models under contraction conditions, proves the well-posedness of counterfactual queries under bounded scale interventions, establishes compositionality and algebraic stability, and derives sub-Gaussian tail bounds for counterfactual functionals, emphasizing sharp concentration of outcomes.\n",
      "2 Background and Problem Setup: This section describes a structural causal model (SCM) called ℳ \\mathcal{M} which is defined by a twin SCM, a shift-scale intervention, and a counterfactual distribution. The SCM is uniquely solvable with respect to a subset of coordinates, and the twin SCM is defined by a mapping f : ℐ \\mathcal{I} → ℰ \\mathcal{E} and a measure function f : ℰ \\mathcal{E} → ℳ \\mathcal{M} . The twin SCM is constructed by applying a perfect intervention to the twin SCM, resulting in a counterfactual distribution of the original state. The text also discusses the semantics of cyclic SCMs, highlighting the alternative interpretation derived from differential equations and emphasizing the framework's applicability to various examples.\n",
      "3 Theory: Okay, let's break down the key takeaways and the overall argument of this text.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Core Idea:** The text is discussing the convergence of a sequence of measures (likely related to a differential operator) to a specific point, and the implications of this convergence for the model's behavior.  It’s essentially a mathematical argument about the stability and predictability of a system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's a breakdown of the key points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The Setup:** The text begins by introducing a system of measures (let's call them `E`) that are being considered. These measures are being iterated, and the goal is to find a point `u` where the iterated measures converge.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The Convergence:** The core of the argument is that this convergence process leads to a system of measures that are *stable* and *predictable*.  This stability is crucial because it suggests the system is well-behaved.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The \"Lipschitz\" Property:** The text emphasizes the importance of the \"Lipschitz\" property.  This is a mathematical concept that means a function (in this case, the iterated measures) is bounded – it doesn't grow too large or too small.  The Lipschitz property is a key factor in ensuring stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **The Picard Iteration:** The text mentions a technique called \"Picard iteration.\" This is a method used to iteratively refine a measure, and the convergence of the iterated measures is a central point of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The Significance of the Convergence:** The text argues that the convergence of the iterated measures *implies* that the system is *simple* – meaning it's predictable and doesn't have too many possible states or paths.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this important?**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Modeling:**  This type of convergence is often used in modeling systems where the system's behavior is influenced by a sequence of steps or iterations.\n",
      "* **Stability Analysis:**  The convergence is a key step in analyzing the stability of a system.  If the system converges to a stable point, it's likely to remain stable over time.\n",
      "* **Predictability:**  The \"simple\" nature of the system is a desirable property, as it allows for better prediction of the system's future behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short, the text is exploring how a sequence of measures converges to a point, and that convergence is linked to the system's stability and predictability.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**To help me understand your question better, could you tell me:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   What specifically are you interested in about this text? Are you trying to understand a particular concept or step?\n",
      "*   Are you working on a related problem or task?\n",
      "4 Example: The twin SCM model simulates a linear cyclic SCM with mutual dependence between consumption and income. A fiscal policy reform reduces consumption and random shocks by a factor of 0.8, resulting in a fixed income supplement of 1.0. This leads to a scaling effect, where the exogenous term E' is calculated as a matrix with a 0.04 coefficient and a 0.0256 coefficient. The contraction is preserved, resulting in a unique interventional equilibrium where consumption rises by approximately 29% and income rises by approximately 82%. The C-C – I-I correlation decreases from 0.75 to 0.69.\n",
      "5 Limitations: The κ-contraction condition must be uniform across the state space, which may be violated by realistic feedback systems. Gaussian noise assumptions lead to polynomial concentration, which is not analyzed. Banach’s theorem on closed domains is invoked for models with open domains, requiring additional consideration. Closure results cover shift-scale interventions, which generalizes hard interventions and provides a foundation for broader extensions. The preservation of global contractivity –that is, the Lipschitz constant remains below one – guarantees unique solvability and allows for richer intervention types, provided they don’t destroy contractivity.\n",
      "6  Conclusion and Future Work: We demonstrated that contraction-based cyclic structural causal models are simple, solvable, and exhibit closed-form solutions for counterfactual functionals under natural regularity assumptions. Future research could explore deep generative models for this class.\n",

      "1 Introduction: TheraMind introduces a dual-loop agent architecture for longitudinal psychological counseling, demonstrating improved efficacy through adaptive therapy selection and a novel dialogue management system. The agent’s architecture facilitates a more strategic and holistic approach to counseling, moving beyond reactive dialogue to achieve clinically sound, personalized therapeutic interactions.\n",
      "2 Related Work: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) are driving innovation in counseling agents, focusing on adaptive, multi-session support. Existing approaches utilize supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and preference optimization to enhance model capabilities.  Efforts have centered on specialized agents like ChatCounselor, CPsyCoun, MentaLLaMA, PsyDial, and PsyDT, incorporating memory, reasoning, and tool use.  Furthermore, LLM-driven autonomous agents are being adapted for healthcare and mental health tasks, leveraging architectures like memory-augmented and hierarchical designs.\n",
      "3 Methodology: TheraMind is an autonomous agent framework designed for multi-session psychotherapy using a dual-loop architecture. The Intra-Session Loop manages real-time dialogue, while the Cross-Session Loop dynamically selects therapeutic methods based on session history and efficacy. A perception module analyzes patient utterances to infer psychological state, enabling a more nuanced interaction than traditional LLMs. The agent generates deliberate responses, integrating tactical strategy and clinical objectives, and dynamically adapts to patient emotional variability through a self-assessment module. A high-fidelity simulation environment, grounded in anonymized CPsyCounR data, provides a robust testbed for evaluating long-term counseling skills.\n",
      "4 Experiments: Here is a concise summary of the provided text:\n",
      "\n",
      "TheraMind demonstrates significant advancements in evaluating counseling agents through a dual-loop architecture, significantly outperforming baseline methods across multiple metrics. The agent effectively maintains long-term, clinically-grounded therapeutic relationships by integrating memory retrieval and strategic adaptation.  It achieves high accuracy in single and multi-session evaluations, particularly in establishing trust and guiding the therapeutic process.  Human evaluations confirm the agent’s robust internal validity and clinical reasoning, highlighting its ability to model a structured longitudinal arc.\n",
      "5 Conclusion: TheraMind is a new agent that overcomes limitations of previous work by decoupling tactical dialogue management from strategic planning, allowing for longitudinal counseling and superior long-term coherence and flexibility.\n",

      "1 Introduction: The paper reviews the evolution of Artificial Intelligence, starting with the foundational concept of autonomous systems, then transitioning through symbolic AI, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, culminating in the current era of large language models. It introduces a dual-paradigm taxonomy – symbolic vs. neural – to analyze the field’s architectural foundations and agency, highlighting key conceptual schisms and gaps in current research. The paper employs a systematic literature review and taxonomy creation to provide a comprehensive analysis of agentic AI, addressing challenges related to retrofitting symbolic paradigms into neural architectures and identifying critical research gaps.\n",
      "2 Theoretical Foundations: Mapping the Dual Lineages of Agentic Intelligence: The paper traces the evolution of AI, starting with the symbolic lineage emphasizing explicit logic and deterministic models, culminating in the neural lineage based on statistical learning and emergent reasoning through large language models. The symbolic lineage provides foundational autonomous systems, while the neural lineage utilizes DRL to create generative pipelines and multi-agent orchestration, ultimately establishing a new paradigm of LLM-driven systems.\n",
      "3 Methodology: This review examines agentic AI research across symbolic and neural paradigms, analyzing evolution, frameworks, and ethical challenges. It employs a systematic search strategy, including database searches and pre-print analysis, classifying studies based on architectural lineage and incorporating thematic synthesis. The study utilizes a multi-faceted approach to analyze key concepts and limitations, including a supplementary contextual analysis of foundational symbolic papers.\n",
      "4 Literature Review: A Dual-Paradigm Analysis: The rapid expansion of Agentic AI has produced a diverse yet fragmented body of research. This section synthesizes the extant literature through the lens of the dual-paradigm framework introduced in Figure 2, analyzing how contributions are distributed across foundational studies, architectural frameworks, and domain-specific applications, focusing on their operational mechanisms to clearly delineate the paradigm shift. Landmark studies have shaped the conceptual and architectural foundations of both paradigms, spanning strategic reasoning, cognitive models, and alignment. These studies collectively mark the progression from explicit, algorithmic deliberation to emergent, stochastic intelligence. They serve as reference points for the fundamental differences in how adaptability, coordination, and strategic reasoning are implemented in each paradigm, illustrating the conceptual divide captured by our framework. The theoretical bedrock of Agentic AI is found in two distinct lineages, each with its own foundational breakthroughs. Landmark studies have shaped the conceptual and architectural foundations of both paradigms, spanning strategic reasoning, cognitive models, and alignment. These studies collectively mark the progression from explicit, algorithmic deliberation to emergent, stochastic intelligence. They serve as reference points for the fundamental differences in how adaptability, coordination, and strategic reasoning are implemented in each paradigm, illustrating the conceptual divide captured by our framework. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has solidified the neural/generative paradigm, which operates on principles fundamentally incompatible with its symbolic predecessor. Modern agentic frameworks leverage LLMs as generative engines within software pipelines, explicitly departing from classical cognitive loops. Their core innovation lies in dynamic context management, prompt engineering, and tool composition. This analysis underscores that these frameworks form the backbone of the neural paradigm, designed for practical task completion through orchestration, not for simulating internal cognitive processes. Mapping them to PPAR or BDI obscures their true innovative mechanics, which are defined by prompt-driven stochasticity, not algorithmic symbol manipulation. Agentic AI frameworks are being deployed across sectors where autonomy and adaptability are essential. The choice of paradigm is critically influenced by domain-specific constraints—ethical, regulatory, or epistemic. The following implementations exemplify how each paradigm is applied. In healthcare, where safety and compliance are paramount, applications diverge clearly along architectural lines. Symbolic systems, such as rule-based clinical decision support tools, are predominantly employed for predictable and auditable tasks. In contrast, the flexibility of neural paradigms is leveraged for tasks like generating structured medical reports [ 66 ] and powering on-premise edge agents [ 87 ] ; however, these neural frameworks are often contained within deterministic tool-chaining pipelines to ensure the reliability required in clinical settings. This pattern of complementary paradigm use is also evident in finance, a domain demanding high accuracy and auditability. Here, neural frameworks dominate tasks involving complex data synthesis and analysis. For instance, CrewAI’s role-based workflow is applied to market analysis [ 43 ] as it provides a clear, auditable trail of agent actions. Similarly, LlamaIndex-powered models for financial sentiment [ 79 ] demonstrate how neural systems use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground their stochastic outputs in verified data, thereby reducing hallucination. Despite this, symbolic systems maintain a critical role in high-frequency trading and core regulatory logic where absolute determinism is non-negotiable. Finally, in scientific research, which requires profound epistemic rigor, the choice of paradigm is dictated by the nature of the intellectual task. The deployment of AutoGen to coordinate multi-agent conversations for economic research [ 69 ] exemplifies the neural paradigm’s strength in simulating collaborative, exploratory discovery and critique. This stands in contrast to the limitations of pure neural approaches, such as hallucination and lack of verifiability. This synergistic combination of symbolic and neural approaches represents a shift from debating paradigm superiority to targeted solutions for adaptability, reliability, and long-term operation in complex environments.\n",
      "5 Analysis of Domain-Specific Applications: The analysis reveals a paradigm-driven approach to agentic AI, where architectural choices are shaped by domain-specific constraints. The symbolic paradigm favors rigid, verifiable rules and auditability, while the neural paradigm leverages generative flexibility but carries risks of hallucination. Hybrid approaches, combining symbolic and neural capabilities, are prevalent, requiring careful governance to mitigate risks across security, resilience, and human-AI collaboration. The framework highlights the need for tailored governance across each paradigm, emphasizing the importance of tool integration and the distinct challenges posed by each architectural choice.\n",
      "6 Comprehensive Taxonomy of Agentic AI Literature: A Paradigm-Aware Analysis: The paper presents a taxonomy of agentic AI literature categorized by architectural paradigms, revealing a market fit for symbolic and hybrid systems in safety-critical applications and data-rich domains, alongside a governance imbalance regarding neural systems. The taxonomy identifies a shift from symbolic to neural orchestration, with ethical challenges in the neural paradigm driving research toward hybrid approaches, ultimately validating the framework as a robust tool for future research.\n",
      "7 Ethical and Governance Challenges: A Paradigm-Specific Analysis: The paper argues that current governance approaches are insufficient for Agentic AI, necessitating a paradigm-specific analysis. This analysis reveals key challenges including the bifurcation of ethical concerns across symbolic and neural paradigms, complex governance implications, liability issues, and the need for human oversight that differs significantly based on system autonomy. A taxonomy of agency levels is proposed, emphasizing governance scales with autonomy, and policy frameworks must extend beyond risk analysis to account for the unique governance needs of Agentic AI.\n",
      "8 Research Gaps: A Paradigm-Specific Roadmap: The research highlights a critical gap in research methodologies – the lack of Paradigm-Aware Research. Future work should focus on integrating paradigms, particularly the “Reasoning & Adaptability” gap, and develop separate evaluation suites to stress-test each architecture’s failure modes. Effective governance requires collaboration between engineers and policymakers to create tailored frameworks for auditing and regulating these fundamentally different technologies, balancing innovation with risk mitigation.\n",
      "9 Future Directions: The Path to Hybrid Intelligence: This paradigm-aware approach to design seeks to integrate symbolic reasoning and neural generation, focusing on Architectural Integration, Neuro-Symbolic Integration, specialized agent roles, and governance mechanisms. Convergence with other technologies will further enhance capabilities, ultimately aiming for adaptable and reliable hybrid intelligence.\n",
      "10 Conclusion: This review establishes two distinct lineages of Agentic AI – symbolic and neural – with differing operational mechanics and strengths. The common practice of conceptual retrofitting obscures their true nature and hinders progress. The framework proposes a hybrid approach, integrating symbolic and neural systems through neuro-symbolic architectures, to address ethical challenges and ensure a coherent theory of architectural design.\n",

      "1 Introduction: Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS) introduces a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of structural dynamics, particularly for guided wave simulations. It combines node-fixed nodal kinematics, a sign-aware acceleration loss, and a wavelength-informed connectivity radius to stabilize finite-difference velocities and improve long-horizon stability. The paper demonstrates GNSS’s effectiveness on wave propagation in a clamped beam, achieving superior performance compared to traditional GNN methods based on absolute nodal positions, through the preservation of locality and mitigation of failure modes.\n",
      "2 Methods: Okay, that’s fantastic feedback! Thank you. Let’s focus on the primary goal – simulating a physical system, specifically a simple, three-point rigid body simulation. The framework is designed to be a foundational building block for more complex simulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s what I’d like to delve into, and what aspects you can help me with:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The Goal:** The primary goal is to simulate the movement of a three-point rigid body – a ball rolling down a slope. We want to understand how the ball's velocity changes over time, and how the slope influences that velocity. It’s a relatively simple system, but it’s a good starting point to demonstrate the core concepts of the framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Emphasis:** I want to emphasize the importance of the fixed timestep size (n=4) as a key design choice. It’s a deliberate simplification to make the problem tractable and to allow us to focus on the core principles of the framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Enhancements:** I’d like to expand on the graph representation. We’re using a simple, rectangular grid to represent the space. Each node in the grid represents a point in the space, and the edges connect points that are directly related (e.g., adjacent points on the slope).  The idea is that the graph will capture the local relationships between points, which is crucial for understanding the ball's motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **wMSE Loss:** I want to elaborate on *how* the wMSE loss function is being used. It’s a simple form of regularization, but we want to ensure it’s effective in preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.  Specifically, we want to ensure the model learns to predict acceleration, not just the position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the graph representation.  Could you help me flesh out the details of the grid and the edges connecting the nodes?  Specifically, I'd like to understand:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Node Types:** What are the different types of nodes in the grid? (e.g., start, end, intermediate points)\n",
      "*   **Edge Types:** What are the different types of edges? (e.g., direct, diagonal, parallel)\n",
      "*   **Edge Weighting:** How are the edge weights determined? (e.g., based on distance, slope, or some other property?)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with the node types and edge types.  I think a simple rectangular grid with nodes representing points on the slope is a good starting point.  What are your initial thoughts on the best way to represent the edges?\n",
      "3 Case Study and Results: Here's a concise summary of the paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors evaluated a numerical dataset using Abaqus to simulate fluid and granular system dynamics. They found that a connectivity radius of approximately 7-10 nodes provides optimal performance through a sensitivity analysis, demonstrating a stable rollout MSE. The paper also analyzes hyperparameter settings, highlights the impact of the penalty term and Gaussian noise, and presents a comparison of GNSS and GNS models, demonstrating GNSS's superior performance, particularly in terms of accuracy and stability.\n",
      "4 Conclusions: GNSS is a graph-network surrogate model for time-resolved structural dynamics simulations. It utilizes a relative node-fixed local coordinate system, a wMSE loss to penalize incorrect sign predictions, and physics-based hyperparameter selection. The model successfully predicts wave propagation, a task where existing GNS models fail, and future work includes expanding to three-dimensional problems and incorporating structural anomaly data.\n",

      "1 Introduction: This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) architecture. The QRNN utilizes a PQC, a quantum state representing the recurrent core, which evolves through unitary transformations, preserving gradients and memory across timesteps. The hidden state is a quantum state, allowing for exponential memory capacity and representing the model’s core recurrent memory. The model’s performance is demonstrated on synthetic tasks and exhibits competitive results with LSTM and scaled Cayley orthogonal scoRNNs, with the PQC proving to be computationally stable and retaining more stable gradients.\n",
      "2 Related Work: Bausch et al. (2020) developed a QRNN with persistent quantum memory based on quantum neurons, but nonlinearities are emulated using probabilistic repeat-until-success circuits. Existing QLSTMs embed PQCs into LSTMs, replacing dense layers with classical dynamics, and Li et al. and Siemaszko et al. model recurrences with PQCs, but without explicit nonlinearities or classical control. The authors demonstrate competitive performance across six sequence modeling tasks.\n",
      "3 Model: 3.1 PQC: A PQC begins with a state of all-zero qubits, applying a series of gates to create superposition and entanglement. Single-qubit gates perform local transformations, while multi-qubit gates generate superposition and entanglement. The composition U U denotes the product of unitary gates, while U† is the conjugate transpose. The PQC consists of L L gates, where each u<sub>i</sub> is a unitary operator acting on a subset of qubits, and U† = u<sub>1</sub>† u<sub>2</sub>† ... u<sub>L</sub>† yields U<sup>†</sup>U = I U<sup>†</sup>U = I. Parametrized unitary gates are fixed or trainable, like neural network weights, and represent structural operations. Measurements provide partial observations of the quantum state, yielding probabilistic readouts based on Pauli-Z and Pauli-X observables. The nonlinearity is generally weak, particularly for rotation gates.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 Hybrid Model: The hybrid model utilizes a quantum state represented by a quantum circuit (PQC) parameterized by a classical feedforward network. Input embeddings are transformed through a quantum gate network, and measurements yield classical readout vectors. The model iteratively updates the quantum state based on the previous state and input, employing end-to-end training with classical backpropagation.\n",
      "4 Experiments: We use the ansatz shown in Fig. 1(a) (scaled to more qubits when required) as the core circuit for the QRNN. Sim et al. [ 2019 ] demonstrate experimentally that this ansatz is expressive, capable of generating strong entanglement, and able to represent a significant portion of the Hilbert space, even compared to deeper circuits built from less expressive ansätze. 9 9 9 See Appendix B for details on the PQC design and expressibility evaluation methodology. We implement and simulate the model using TorchQuantum [Wang et al., 2022 ] , which remains less optimized than classical toolkits due to the lack of efficient kernels for hybrid operations involving tight classical–quantum feedback, particularly in recurrent settings. Our ansatz balances expressivity, implementation simplicity, and simulation efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 𝐌𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 \\mathbf{Measure} in Eq. 3 , measurements are performed in each of the Pauli- 𝐗 \\mathbf{X} , Pauli- 𝐘 \\mathbf{Y} , and Pauli- 𝐙 \\mathbf{Z} observables across all wires in the PQC, and the measurement outcomes are combined to form 𝐳 t \\mathbf{z}_{t} (Eq. 3 ). For the feedforward network ℱ \\mathcal{F} (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 ), we experimented with GLU nonlinearities. 10 10 10 GLU\n",
      "requires projecting to twice the output dimensionality, effectively increasing the parameter count compared to standard nonlinearities like ReLU, LeakyReLU, GLU and GELU. For both language modeling and translation, we first transform the measurement outcomes with a separate feedforward layer and use the result both for vocabulary classification and as input to the next timestep.\n",
      "All experiments are run on a single A100/A30 GPU and we select the best models on the validation split across different random seeds and report the test results. The per-epoch training runtime ranges from ~4 minutes for MNIST (with 10 qubits) to ~60 minutes for language modeling (with 14 qubits). Hyperparameters shared across all the tasks include the Adam optimizer without learning rate decay ( l ​ r = 1 × 10 − 3 , λ = 1 × 10 − 4 , and ​ ϵ = 1 × 10 − 10 ) (lr=1\\times 10^{-3},\\ \\lambda=1\\times 10^{-4},\\ \\text{and}\\ \\epsilon=1\\times 10^{-10}) and dropout applied to the input at each step, with task-dependent drop rates. We apply full-sequence backpropagation without truncation, except for language modeling, where sequences are truncated to 35 tokens. No pretrained word embeddings are used. Additional hyperparameters and test set statistics (mean, min, max across runs) are provided in Appendix C . For scoRNN, we use a hidden size of 170 and the hyperparameters from Helfrich et al. [ 2018 ] are used throughout.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IMDB sentiment dataset [Maas et al., 2011 ] is a balanced binary classification benchmark with 25K labeled reviews each for training and testing. The average review length is 241 tokens, with a maximum length of 2,500 tokens. We use 7.5K reviews from the training set for validation and truncate all reviews to a maximum length of 400 tokens across all models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results in Table 4 show that QRNN GLU with 13 qubits closely matches the LSTM, followed by QRNN GLU with 10 qubits. For the QRNN, it is somewhat surprising that intermediate readouts can still support mechanisms like soft attention, since these readouts capture only partial projections of the quantum state rather than the full hidden state. This suggests that, despite intermediate measurements, sufficient information is retained and propagated across timesteps. We qualitatively interpret the learned soft alignments on a few examples where the translations required non-trivial linguistic interpretations in Appendix D .\n",
      "\n",
      "We measure per-timestep gradient norms on IMDB ( T = 400 T=400 ) and pMNIST ( T = 28 T=28 ) by retaining gradients on the per-timestep readouts (QRNN) and hidden states (LSTM) from saved checkpoints and computing ∥ ∂ ℒ / ∂ 𝐡 t ∥ 2 \\lVert\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial\\mathbf{h}_{t}\\rVert_{2} .\n",
      "\n",
      "Gradients are averaged across samples in a mini-batch and normalized by the last-step norm ∥ ∂ ℒ / ∂ 𝐡 T ∥ 2 \\lVert\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial\\mathbf{h}_{T}\\rVert_{2} to compare decay shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "As shown in Fig. 3 , the QRNN curves remain consistently above the LSTM on both IMDB and pMNIST, indicating less vanishing through time toward the start of the sequences. All curves start with 1.0 1.0 at t = T t=T (normalization), but the relative elevation of the QRNN curve at earlier timesteps demonstrates more stable gradient propagation. The LSTM gradient norm decays rapidly, collapsing below 10-4e-4 on the relatively short pMNIST sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "5 Discussion and Conclusion: Different quantum hardware platforms require distinct control stacks, architectural choices affecting circuit realization, and mid-circuit measurements limit simulations. A hybrid QRNN, with a PQC controller, aims to study empirical properties through projective measurements, aligning with existing mid-circuit measurement techniques. Improvements in toolchains and hardware will enable more accurate simulations via ancilla-mediated schemes. The paper introduces a new hybrid QRNN architecture, preserving norms for stable gradient propagation, and utilizes classical feedback for expressiveness.\n",
      "Appendix A Quantum States and Superposition: A qubit exists in a superposition of 0 and 1 states within a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space. The amplitudes α and β satisfy the equation |α|² + |β|² = 1.  The state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ represents the probability of measuring 0 or 1, respectively.\n",
      "Appendix B PQC Template: The PQC template was chosen based on Sim et al. [2019] benchmarking, which evaluated 19 parametrized quantum circuits. The proposed ansatz-14 architecture scored highly on expressibility and entangling capability, offering a balance between simulation cost and PQC quality. Expressibility is quantified by comparing fidelities to Haar-random states, and the KL divergence provides a score reflecting the PQC’s expressiveness.\n",
      "Appendix C Experimental Settings and Test Accuracy Statistics Across Runs: The study examines how barren plateaus, a phenomenon in parametrized quantum circuits, arise and depend on various design choices. While vanishing gradients are possible, their occurrence isn't guaranteed and is influenced by the circuit's structure, cost function, initialization, training strategy, and noise.  Architectural designs, like those used in quantum convolutional neural networks, can prevent or mitigate plateaus, suggesting a tractable training landscape can be achieved with careful design.\n",
      "Appendix D Attention Alignments: The model demonstrates soft attention alignment by effectively managing spatial and syntactic shifts, capturing clause-level structure and semantics through hidden states and soft attention, and successfully reassembling verb phrases. It handles compound verb constructions and semantic expansion, demonstrates syntactic reordering and clause realignment, and adapts to multi-clause coordination and tense adaptation.\n",

Experiments were conducted using Qwen3-Instruct model, with batch size 64, learning rate 1e-6, temperature 0.6, sequence length 8192, and maximum interactions 6. Inference involved greedy decoding with T=0.0 and SQLite as the SQL executor. The system utilized 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.2 Main Result: Performance on Main Benchmarks: MTIR-SQL achieves significantly higher results than other models across various parameter sizes, including 64.4% on the BIRD Dev set with a 4B model, and 57.17% on the 10B-30B range. Similarly, MTIR-SQL outperforms models like ChatGPT + CoT and SuperSQL, achieving comparable performance with a 4B model. Reasoning Paradigms demonstrate effectiveness with multiturn tool-integrated reasoning, particularly with the multi-turn TIR with GRPO-Filter paradigm, achieving 63.1% on BIRD Dev and 82.4% on SPIDER Dev and Test.\n",

      "4.3 Ablation Study: Here’s a summary of the paper’s sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "The study investigates the impact of different reward components on a text-to-SQL model. Ablation studies assess the effects of different strategies, including the GRPO-Filter, Max Turns, and Reward Design, on model performance. The Ablation Study of RL Methods demonstrates that the GRPO-Filter stabilizes multi-turn training while sacrificing reward collapse. The Ablation Study on Max Turns reveals that while larger turns improve final rewards, excessive turns can lead to instability. The Ablation Study on Reward Design shows that removing exploration rewards improves performance, while excessive exploration hinders it. The Ablation Study on Result Reward highlights its crucial role in the conversion process. The paper concludes that a balanced reward system is essential for optimal performance.\n",
      "5 conclusion: MTIR-SQL is a novel reinforcement learning framework for complex SQL generation tasks. It utilizes feedback-driven reasoning to improve generation stability and query accuracy through a self-correcting mechanism. Experimental results show it outperforms baseline methods and achieves 64.4% accuracy on BIRD-SQL and 84.6% execution accuracy on SPIDER with a 4B-parameter model.\n",

      "1 Introduction: This research introduces a novel AI-assisted diagnostic platform leveraging fine-tuned LLMs, the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning model, and an orchestration LLM to improve the accuracy and consistency of mental disorder diagnoses. The system analyzes conversational data to predict diagnoses, utilizes a consortium of LLMs for final decision-making, and incorporates responsible AI principles through a dedicated orchestration agent. The prototype is deployed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team, demonstrating potential for resource-constrained environments through low-computation techniques.\n",
      "2 Background: This section provides an overview of LLMs, fine-tuning techniques, and the development of AI agents for psychiatric diagnostic support. Large Language Models (LLMs) form the core of the platform, offering advantages in natural language processing, reasoning, and customization. Fine-tuning adapts these models to specific domains, while LoRA and Quantized LoRA reduce computational costs. AI agents, powered by LLMs, enable autonomous task execution within complex environments, particularly through collaborative, role-based systems.\n",
      "3 System Architecture: The Data Lake Layer stores extensive conversational datasets for training and fine-tuning LLMs, aligned with diagnostic frameworks. The LLM Agent Layer orchestrates the integration of these datasets, fine-tuned LLMs, and the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning engine, dynamically constructing prompts and aggregating outputs to ensure optimal information flow and model interoperability. The LLM Layer analyzes conversations and generates diagnostic predictions, utilizing fine-tuned LLMs trained on mental health datasets. The OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning Layer synthesizes these predictions, evaluating and refining them to determine the most consistent and clinically aligned diagnosis, ensuring accuracy and alignment with DSM-5 criteria.\n",
      "4 Platform Functionality: The platform utilizes four key functionalities: Data Lake setup for large-scale conversational datasets, LLM fine-tuning using a curated dataset, diagnosis prediction by specialized LLMs, and a final diagnosis by OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. The Data Lake provides the foundational training resource, while fine-tuning transforms models into diagnostic agents. The platform employs multiple state-of-the-art models and optimization techniques like Quantized Low-Rank Adapters to ensure robust and scalable inference. The ensemble-based architecture, integrating multiple LLMs and a reasoning LLM, enhances diagnostic diversity and clinical validity.\n",
      "5 Implementation and Evaluation: The U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport News, Virginia, collaborated with the LLM Agent Layer to fine-tune three large language models (LMs) – Llama-3, Mistral, and Qwen – for psychiatric diagnosis. These models were trained on a dataset of psychiatrist-patient conversations, diagnostic reasoning, and diagnoses, partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets. Fine-tuning utilized the Unsloth library and NVIDIA A100 GPUs/Tesla TPUs for efficient training. The initial training process took approximately 1,627 seconds, with peak memory usage reaching 14.605 GB, requiring careful resource management. The validation loss decreased smoothly, stabilizing around step 25, while training loss decreased more aggressively, plateauing slightly, and the training loss difference remained positive, indicating potential overfitting.  Figure 10 visualizes training dynamics, including loss differences, ratios, and derivatives, providing insights into convergence and generalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LLM Agent Layer required structured conversational data for the dataset, which was preprocessed and transformed into a schema. The fine-tuned models were quantized using QLoRA for deployment on consumer-grade hardware, enhancing their portability. The OpenAI-gpt-oss LLM was used to make the final diagnosis based on the LLM’s predictions, incorporating contextual patient-physician conversations. The evaluation focused on fine-tuning, diagnostic performance, and reasoning performance across the three LLMs, with a focus on identifying psychiatric symptoms and accurate diagnoses.\n",

Med‑PaLM-2 achieved expert-level performance on medical licensing exams and demonstrated preference for long-form answers over human experts, performing well on open-ended generation tasks and multimodal inputs like radiology images. A multimodal extension, Med‑PaLM-M, enhances reasoning over visual data and integrates clinical narratives for improved diagnostic reasoning. The model incorporates ethical frameworks and safety assessments to mitigate risks and ensure trust in healthcare applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 LLM for Differential Diagnosis (DDx): The “LLM for DDx” framework uses LLMs to generate differential diagnoses from clinical vignettes, leveraging prompt engineering and few-shot/zero-shot prompting to simulate clinician reasoning. It demonstrates capabilities in recognizing comorbidities, temporal disease progression, and rare conditions, but lacks multimodal data integration and structured inference. Its adaptability across specialties is a key strength, but accuracy is affected by prompt variations.\n",

      "1 Introduction: KnowCoder-A1 is an agentic reasoning model for Knowledge Base Question Answering, designed to autonomously decompose tasks, utilize tools, and refine queries. It leverages outcome supervision through a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning approach, improving robustness and flexibility compared to existing agentic approaches. Experiments on WebQSP, CWQ, and GrailQA demonstrate its superior performance, achieving a 11.1% relative improvement over KBQA-o1 in GrailQA and consistently outperforming previous approaches across all datasets.\n",
      "2 Related Work: Traditional KBQA methods utilize retrieval and ranking, while agentic methods leverage prompts and finetuning to enhance reasoning and explore the KB.\n",
      "3 Preliminaries: Knowledge base, natural language question, agentic reasoning, probability, optimal policy, trajectory, gold answer set.\n",
      "4 Methodology: 4.1 Agentic Initialization: The agent employs a ReAct-style framework, interleaving explicit reasoning and tool use, terminating with a final answer. It utilizes three tools: SearchTypes, SearchGraphPatterns, and ExecuteSPARQL. The agent's state is a trajectory, evolving through interactions and tool calls, and the trajectory is updated with each step. The agent's actions are defined by a finite set of tool calls, and the tool executor executes tool calls against a knowledge base.\n",
      "4.2 SFT-based Cold-start Stage: The cold-start stage refines KBs with reasoning trajectories, utilizing outcome-based rejection sampling to ensure high-quality, diverse data. It employs a mixed question set, up-sampling infrequent types, and a prompt encouraging trial-and-error. The model's training focuses on complete trajectories to enhance long-term reasoning, masking external observation tokens to maintain internal reasoning coherence.\n",
      "4.3 RL-based Exploration Stage: The paper introduces the GRPO method for RL-based exploration, utilizing a balanced reward function incorporating a Format Reward and Answer Reward to mitigate sparsity and encourage reasoning. Initial training uses a cold-start model, employing a curriculum strategy to gradually adjust the reward difficulty, starting with precision-focused rewards and transitioning to a balanced reward.\n",
      "5 Experiments: To prove the effectiveness of KnowCoder-A1, comprehensive experiments were conducted, comparing it against prompting-based and fine-tuning-based methods. The study focuses on RQ1 (outperformance), RQ2 (main components), RQ3 (KBQA reasoning), RQ4 (reasoning trajectory), and RQ5 (case study). The results demonstrate KnowCoder-A1 establishes a new state-of-the-art for low-resource KBQA, significantly outperforming baselines through enhanced data efficiency, reasoning capabilities, and inference speed.\n",
      "6 Conclusion: KnowCoder-A1 is a novel agentic reasoning model trained through a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning framework. It leverages outcome-only supervision and a progressive reward schedule to enhance autonomous exploration and robustness. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in recovering from errors and exploring diverse reasoning strategies.\n",

      "Appendix A Experiment Setup: The study evaluates reasoning performance on WebQSP, CWQ, and GrailQA using three datasets: Freebase-based WebQSP, more complex entities in CWQ, and a comprehensive evaluation in GrailQA.  It employs a uniform sampling strategy for GrailQA, comparing KnowCoder-A1 against fine-tuning, partial data, and full-data methods, including SFT-traj, MCTS-KBQA, RnG-KBQA, TIARA, KB-BINDER, KB-Coder, and Interactive-KBQA.  The evaluation metrics are F1 score, Random Hits@1, and Exact Match, referencing previous work. The implementation utilizes the Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base and employs a cosine learning rate schedule, batch size of 8, and maximum sequence length of 4096 for fine-tuning.\n",
      "Appendix B Further Analysis: Appendix B further analyzes model performance, comparing Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base, Qwen3-8B-Base, and KnowCoder-A1. Qwen2.5-Coder-7-Base demonstrates superior overall performance, while Qwen3-8B-Base performs better on the simpler WebQSP dataset. KnowCoder-A1 achieves comparable performance to ToG while maintaining a similar computational budget, demonstrating efficiency through outcome-based supervision. The analysis reveals a shift in robustness, initially showing a downward-sloping triangle with high error rates, followed by a flattening into a rectangle with high rewards, illustrating a transition from brittle execution to a robust, recovering policy.\n",
      "Appendix C Statistics: The statistics of training samples used in cold-start-stage and RL stages were analyzed on three datasets.\n",
      "Appendix D Error Analysis: Error analysis identified Hallucinations, Constraint Application Errors, and Relation Recall/Selection Errors as primary limitations. Hallucinations stem from flawed self-correction, while the other two errors result from incorrect reasoning during complex questions. The high rate of constraint errors on WebQSP is attributed to failing to identify implicit temporal constraints.\n",
      "Appendix E Prompts: The prompt used for both training and evaluation was a system prompt and a user prompt.\n",
      "Appendix F Case Study: Case studies demonstrate the agent’s reasoning flexibility and robustness through two examples: one recovering from consecutive empty queries by leveraging a distant history, and the other adapting to an illogical query result through self-correction.\n",

      "1.  Introduction: VQ-Bench is a framework for evaluating speech models' sensitivity to voice quality variation. It presents parallel prompts in various phonation types, used to evaluate long-form and speech emotion recognition. The study aims to systematically study SFM behavior under controlled variation, create synthetic voice quality data, and provide an open-ended evaluation protocol.\n",
      "2.  Method: The paper constructs 20 long-form prompts to evaluate voice quality, drawing on real-world application examples and incorporating four categories: Therapy, Career advice, Interview screening, and Storytelling. These prompts feature five distinct variations of voice quality, utilizing a combination of context and framing. The paper synthesizes prompts using F5-TTS, extracting speech from the Buckeye corpus and the Centre for Speech Technology Voice Cloning Toolkit. VoiceQualityVC then converts these prompts into modal, breathy, creaky, and end-creak versions, generating 12 second stretches of uninterrupted speech as reference audio for F5-TTS. Acoustic parameter measurements, specifically H1-H2 and H1-A3, were used to differentiate creaky and breathy phonation types, with significance levels indicating differences in voice quality across the two corpora.\n",
      "3.  Experiments: Experiments involve two tasks: a long-form task with two SFMs providing constructive advice and career suggestions, and a speech emotion recognition (SER) task using xlsr-en-speech-emotion-recognition. The LLM judge evaluates responses on multiple dimensions, and the SER task tests phonation type variations in emotion prediction.\n",
      "4.  Results: The LFMAudio2 model demonstrates reliable gender detection, with the Gemini-2.5-flash-lite judge LLM ratings of LFMAudio2-1.5B responses showing consistent responses across voice qualities. Analysis of the CLMM revealed interactions between voice quality and gender, with a significant effect for the “Heroic agency” evaluation dimension for the Buckeye corpus, differing across tasks and voice qualities. Voice quality significantly impacted evaluation dimensions, with breathy and end-creak yielding higher ratings for STEM vs. care, while creaky voice yielded more care-oriented ratings. The therapy task showed mixed results, with voice quality influencing scores, but consistent across corpora. The interview task showed lower scores across all voice qualities except for creaky voice, with the effect of voice quality being significant. The storytelling task showed consistent results across corpora. The therapy task showed that non-modal voice qualities increased scores compared to modal voice, with the effect of end-creak aligning more with breathy speech than creaky voice. Female voices were systematically rated lower than male voices in the interview task, particularly for ‘Salary offer’ and ‘Leadership endorsement.’ The SER results used Bayesian multilevel categorical regression, predicting emotion labels from voice quality, gender, and prompt, with a random intercept per speaker. The model converged with R-hat values indicating good convergence, revealing meaningful effects for voice quality categories compared to modal voice, and gender effects.\n",
      "5.  Discussion: Results demonstrate that voice quality significantly alters responses in long-form response tasks and SER tasks. Internal consistency was high despite disparate corpora, with results mirroring literature on voice quality associations (e.g., Xu et al., 2013) and gender bias. Future analysis should include gender-ambiguous voices to assess potential amplification of biases beyond the binary paradigm. The mapping between perceived meaning and voice quality is preliminary but could serve as a resource for hypothesis development.\n",
      "6.  Conclusion: Experiments demonstrate that controlled phonation shifts significantly influence model behavior across tasks, particularly in long-form generation, affecting agency, empathy, and leadership, and speech emotion recognition, with breathy speech eliciting more affiliative responses and creaky voice more reserved judgments. These patterns align with human perceptual biases and highlight the importance of voice quality for responsible use in applications requiring nuanced vocal cues.\n",

SFMs generate textual and speech outputs, differing in their modality. The LFMAudio2-1.5B produces both text and speech, while the OpenAI API produces only speech, requiring a transcription step.

The model achieves 57.47% accuracy and 62.01% precision, surpassing MASTER’s 62.44% and demonstrating strong reliability in identifying upward price movements. Backtesting reveals a 50.00% annual return, 57.7% higher than MASTER, and the highest Sharpe ratio, Calmar ratio, and lowest maximum drawdown, validating its effectiveness in generating high returns with manageable risk.\n",
      "5. Conclusion: The H3M-SSMoEs framework, a multi-modal model integrating hypergraphs, LLMs, and SMoEs, improves stock prediction accuracy and risk-adjusted returns across diverse indices. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing temporal dependencies and long-term relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component.\n",
      "References: References include cited works that support, illustrate, or expand upon the ideas presented in the text. They are listed in a specific format, typically with author, year, and title of the work.\n",
      "Appendix A Problem Definition: We formulate the d-day-ahead stock movement prediction task as a binary classification problem. The model estimates the probability of an upward price movement for each stock, given the historical quantitative features, news text, and temporal embeddings.\n",
      "Appendix B Global Context Hypergraph (GCH): The GCH hypergraph represents a multi-headed attention mechanism, transforming features into stock-level representations, enabling modeling of long-term cross-stock relationships across multiple temporal scales. It employs a multi-head attention mechanism, generating four complementary attention matrices, each emphasizing distinct facets of global market dynamics. The GCH hypergraph utilizes hypergraph representations, projecting dyadic attention weights into latent industry factors, and integrating them through adaptive fusion to synthesize a unified global incidence matrix. This fusion module learns non-linear combinations to amplify synergistic relationships while suppressing redundancy, and employs JSD-based adaptive weighting to construct a diagonal weight matrix. Global hypergraph convolutions are applied to both modalities, capturing persistent patterns across the entire temporal span, resulting in features reshaped to ℝ N × T × D.\n",
      "Appendix C Expert Routing and Aggregation: The system uses sparse routing and aggregation. Experts are routed based on augmented market representations, with sparse gating selecting top K experts. Aggregated output is a weighted combination of selected experts, dynamically adjusting to market conditions. Industry experts follow a similar process using industry-augmented representations.\n",
      "Appendix D Experiment Settings: The model was implemented in PyTorch, optimized using cross-entropy loss, trained for 40 epochs with AdamW, linear warmup, and a decay schedule. Hyperparameters included a frozen Llama-3.2-1B model with a hidden dimension of 2048, a lookback window of 20 trading days with a prediction horizon of 10 days, and structural hyperparameters tuned through grid search to maximize validation accuracy.\n",

The portfolio value at day t is P t P_{t}.\n",
      "Appendix G Backtesting Setting: The backtesting setting describes a dynamic d-day stock trading strategy with a transaction cost rate of 0.25% per trade, utilizing a pseudocode and a grid search to optimize hyperparameters. The strategy involves predicting price rises for stocks, allocating a portfolio based on probability, implementing a stop-loss, and rebalancing positions daily.  The backtesting framework includes a validation set with a grid search across three hyperparameters (portfolio selection ratio, stop-loss threshold, and rising ratio) to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing Sharpe ratio.\n",

      "I Introduction: The paper introduces an agent-based RAG system designed for fintech domain retrieval, addressing challenges of acronym resolution, contextual understanding, and evaluation within complex, regulated environments. It proposes an Orchestrator Agent, specialized sub-agents for acronym handling, query rewriting, and re-ranking, alongside a semi-automated evaluation strategy utilizing LLM-as-a-judge and internal knowledge bases. The system aims to improve retrieval accuracy and answer relevance through a modular architecture and a focused evaluation methodology.\n",
      "II Related Work: This paper reviews recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, particularly focusing on agentic architectures and domain-specific implementations. Singh et al. and Nguyen et al. introduce Agentic RAG and MA-RAG, respectively, integrating autonomous agents for dynamic query decomposition and reasoning. Barron et al. propose the SMART-SLIC framework to enhance retrieval accuracy through knowledge graph integration. The Pathway team emphasizes agent task specialization and leverages structured knowledge sources.  Numerous studies demonstrate the benefits of these approaches in specialized domains like finance, healthcare, and law, highlighting the need for real-time, curated retrieval pipelines to improve factual accuracy and trustworthiness in high-stakes contexts.\n",
      "III Agent Design: III-A Baseline RAG System: A sequential retrieval pipeline utilizing specialized agents – Query Reformulator, Retriever, and Summary Agent – begins with user input, iteratively refining it through agents, retrieving relevant documents using cosine similarity, aggregating them into an answer, and avoiding information not found in the context. B-RAG serves as a simplified benchmark for evaluating agentic architecture improvements, despite limitations including a single-pass retrieval, lack of sub-query decomposition, and absence of re-ranking.\n",
      "\n",
      "III-B Proposed Refined Design: The A-RAG system integrates modular intelligence and task-specific specialization, utilizing an Orchestrator Agent to coordinate specialized agents focused on retrieval or synthesis. It addresses challenges like ambiguity and fragmented sources through features like acronym resolution, sub-query generation, parallel retrieval, re-ranking, and quality assessment. A comparison of the pipeline architectures is presented in Figure 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "III-C System Architecture and Workflow: The A-RAG system comprises eight specialized agents, orchestrated by an orchestrator, that guide iterative retrieval and reasoning. The system’s workflow begins with query reformulation and acronym expansion to enhance clarity, followed by vector retrieval, which returns top-k relevant chunks. Sub-queries are generated to address low initial retrieval scores, and the system re-ranks these based on semantic alignment. A Re-Ranker Agent further refines the output, while a Summary Agent synthesizes a concise answer from the retrieved content. An QA Agent evaluates the answer’s relevance and support, determining pipeline progression or refinement.\n",
      "IV Data and Evaluation Strategy: The study constructs a knowledge base from proprietary internal documents, preprocessing it through a custom pipeline to convert structured markup into clean, linear text. A vector index stores over 30,000 text chunks, with an average of 19 chunks per document, representing 1,624 unique documents. A multi-phase evaluation pipeline was developed, utilizing a language model to generate question-answer pairs and a quality control process to select relevant pairs. A benchmark was created, extracting questions from internal knowledge base content and human-verified answer pairs, forming the foundation for quantitative and qualitative evaluations.\n",
      "V Experiments and Results: B-RAG demonstrated a significantly improved retrieval accuracy (69.70%) compared to A-RAG (64.3%) using a human-curated benchmark, while A-RAG’s latency was reduced to 5.02 seconds, compared to B-RAG’s 0.79 seconds, due to iterative document re-ranking.  The A-RAG system’s sub-query generation and re-ranking modules yielded a higher proportion of correct answers, increasing the semantic accuracy metric to 7.04, while B-RAG’s performance was limited by missing exact matches.\n",
      "VI Discussion: The A-RAG system demonstrates improved retrieval accuracy through agentic decomposition, supported by manual review and cross-encoder re-ranking, particularly in procedural queries. Sub-query generation effectively addresses edge cases and improved coverage and semantic accuracy, while acronym resolution presents challenges due to over-filtering and inconsistent performance. The modular structure offers robustness to domain-specific ambiguity compared to the static B-RAG pipeline, although acronym resolution remains inconsistent.\n",
      "VII Conclusion and Future Work: This study demonstrated that a modular RAG pipeline, incorporating agent-driven resolution, decomposition, and reranking, improved retrieval accuracy by 62.35% compared to a baseline. Future work will focus on improved agent coordination through reinforcement learning, enhanced context awareness (discourse, temporal, multi-turn memory), and strengthening reasoning capabilities, particularly in producing helpful and nuanced responses.\n",

      "1 Introduction: The Rationale Score (r-score) quantifies a query’s learning efficiency based on its reasoning tree structure, offering a more accurate assessment of difficulty than path-based metrics. The Re-Schedule algorithm, a data scheduling method, utilizes the r-score to create an efficient curriculum for RLVR training, prioritizing high-scoring queries in the initial phases to accelerate convergence on complex problems. Empirical evidence demonstrates this approach significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to 3.2% on complex reasoning tasks.\n",
      "2 Related Work: This paper reviews existing methods for improving LLM reasoning, focusing on a novel training data schedule optimization approach. It introduces GRPO, supplemented by techniques like LIMR, R 3 R^{3}, LPPO, SEED-GRPO, and DELT, which utilize data entropy and reasoning tree analysis to quantify query learning potential.\n",
      "3 Preliminaries: The GRPO algorithm optimizes a policy π θ \\pi_{\\theta} based on generated responses Shao et al. (2024; Yu et al. 2025). It generates G G responses {o i } i = 1, and the policy calculates the token-level objective function r i, t = π θ ​ ( o i, t | q, o i, < t) π old ​ ( o i, t | q, o i, < t) r_{i,t}=\\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(o_{i,t}|q,o_{i,<t})}{\\pi_{\\text{old}}(o_{i,t}|q,o_{i,<t})} for queries q q from a dataset 𝒟 \\mathcal{D} . The advantage term A i, t A_{i,t} is constant for all tokens within a single response, calculated by normalizing the response's reward R i R_{i} relative to the other responses in the group δ δ is a small constant for numerical stability. Data scheduling algorithms modulate the objective by weighting the query's contribution with ω (q, t) ω(q,t) and the tree is structured as a triplet (nodes, edges, parent-child relationships).\n",
      "4 Motivation: The study uses a Qwen2.5-Math-7B model to compare query accuracy across two sets of 100 queries. Blue lines represent queries with high initial accuracy but require extensive training, while red lines represent queries with simple tree structures that improve rapidly. The discrepancy reveals that path-based metrics like accuracy are misleading indicators of learning difficulty, motivating the development of a new metric based on reasoning tree structure.\n",
      "5 Method: The Reasoning Tree Schedule enhances RLVR performance by using a fixed-structure k-ary approximation for each query, leveraging the Reasoning Score (r-score) to guide learning. The r-score quantifies query difficulty, and the framework constructs a manageable tree through a branching strategy, maximizing accuracy gain while minimizing computational overhead. Dynamic weighting adjusts query weights based on training step and r-score, prioritizing simpler queries during early training and gradually shifting towards more challenging instances to improve generalization.\n",
      "6 Analysis: The experiment used the Minimum Corrective Nodes (MCN) as a metric to validate that reinforcement learning is optimizing reasoning tree structure during training. Training data exhibited a consistent downward trend, regardless of target accuracy, confirming the process’s effectiveness. The r-score method identified queries with lower learning difficulty, as demonstrated by improved model performance on the test set.\n",
      "7 Experiment: The Re-Schedule method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, scoring 48.5 on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and 44.5 on Qwen2.5-7B compared to baselines like ACC s i g m o i d and classical RLVR methods. The r-score, reflecting reasoning tree structure, proves more effective than path-based metrics for measuring query learning difficulty.  Decreasing the dynamic range resulted in performance degradation, highlighting the importance of a sufficient range for curriculum differentiation.\n",
      "8 Conclusions: The authors challenged the use of path-based metrics for RLVR data scheduling. They introduced the r-score, a novel metric measuring learnability based on reasoning tree structure, and proposed Re-Schedule, a curriculum learning algorithm utilizing the r-score. Experiments showed Re-Schedule consistently outperformed classical RLVR and existing scheduling methods, demonstrating that the r-score is a more effective measure of learnability than path-based accuracy.\n",

      "1 Introduction: Multi-objective search is a burgeoning field with growing interest across diverse disciplines, including operations research, robotics, and machine learning. This paper presents an accessible overview of recent advances, focusing on problem variants, algorithms, and applications, while acknowledging the need for further technical detail.\n",
      "2 Problem Setting & Variants: Okay, let's break down this text and summarize the key points about the paper's focus. Here's a consolidated explanation of the paper's core ideas:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Paper's Goal: Finding the Pareto Front of a Graph**\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper tackles a computationally challenging problem: finding the Pareto front of a graph – a set of solutions where no solution is worse across all objectives.  It's a bit of a puzzle, and the paper proposes a method to efficiently find this set.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and the paper's approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **The Problem:**  Imagine a graph with multiple paths (edges).  Each path has a \"cost\" (e.g., travel time, distance). The goal is to find the set of paths that offer the *best* combination of all these costs (the Pareto front).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The Challenge: NP-hardness:** Finding the Pareto front is computationally hard.  This means that no known algorithm can guarantee finding the best solution in a reasonable amount of time for large graphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Proposed Solution (MOSSP):** The paper introduces a method called MOSSP (Multi-objective Stochastic Shortest Path).  It's a variation of the MOS problem, but it adds a probabilistic element – the agent learns through experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Key Components of MOSSP:**\n",
      "   * **Probabilistic Transitions:** The agent doesn't just move from one path to another; it randomly chooses a path with a certain probability.\n",
      "   * **Objective Functions:**  The agent optimizes multiple objectives (cost, distance, etc.).\n",
      "   * **Local and Global Optimization:** MOSSP uses both local (finding good paths within a small region) and global (finding the best overall path) optimization techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The Paper's Contribution:** The paper provides a method to efficiently compute the Pareto front, addressing the computational challenges of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, the paper is about developing a method to efficiently explore and find the best possible combination of paths in a graph, given a probabilistic approach to learning.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the paper, such as:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The mathematical details of the MOSSP algorithm?\n",
      "*   The specific challenges the paper addresses?\n",
      "*   The connection to other related research areas (e.g., reinforcement learning)?\n",
      "3 Algorithmic Advances: Here’s a concise summary of the provided text:\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent algorithmic advances in multi-objective optimization, particularly in the field of graph algorithms, have significantly improved the efficiency of exact and approximate methods.  The work focuses on improvements in generalization of the MOS algorithm, exemplified by the Multi-Objective A* (MOA ∗) algorithm, which introduced dimensionality reduction and node ordering techniques.  Recent advancements include algorithms like BOA ∗, which simplifies the MOA ∗ approach, and recent work on parallelization strategies leveraging SIMD instructions.  The study of dynamic MOS theory, including the proposed framework for vertex classification, represents a significant theoretical contribution.\n",
      "4 MOS as an Algorithmic Toolbox: The Multi-Objective Minimum Spanning Tree (MO-MST) problem, originally NP-hard, is crucial for communication networks and transport logistics, leveraging MOS techniques like A ∗ pex.  The Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Path Finding (MO-MAPF) problem addresses complex multi-objective optimization in shared environments, utilizing MAPF and MOS to generate Pareto-optimal path plans.  The Constrained Shortest-Path problem focuses on finding shortest paths subject to constraints, with recent advancements incorporating MOS and multi-objective techniques.\n",
      "5 Emerging Applications: MOS and its variants are applied across diverse fields including chemistry, biology, and engineering, demonstrating applicability despite its relative simplicity compared to more complex models. Examples include retrosynthesis planning in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and generative design, where MOS identifies novel molecular candidates with high efficacy and pharmacological profiles. Multi-modal journey planning, combining transport modes and optimization, is utilized in metropolitan areas through tools like OpenTripPlanner 2, generating approximately 40,000 trip plans per weekday in Portland, Oregon. MOS also contributes to robotics by balancing cost, energy, and safety, exemplified by rulebook-based autonomous vehicle planning, including considerations of traffic rules like Singapore’s Final Theory of Driving.\n",
      "6 Open Challenges and Opportunities: Despite progress, key challenges remain in MOS algorithms, including scalability limitations, difficulty navigating high-dimensional cost spaces, and the need for adaptable dynamic environments. Opportunities exist in leveraging preference elicitation, integrating with other AI fields, and developing a standardized benchmark suite to foster community collaboration and improve comparability across diverse domains.\n",
      "7 Conclusion: MOS has evolved into a broad principle influencing multiple disciplines and communities, with algorithmic advancements in search, approximate algorithms, and theoretical understanding. Applications have adopted MOS methods to address trade-offs between metrics, highlighting a need for greater cross-fertilization of multi-objective optimization approaches.\n",

      "1 Introduction: LieSolver aims to solve linear homogeneous PDEs using a Lie-symmetrical machine learning framework, offering a more accurate and efficient approach than PINNs by enforcing the PDE directly through a PDE-informed architecture, minimizing training time and requiring only boundary data.\n",
      "2 Theoretical Background: Okay, let's break down this text and focus on understanding the core concepts presented.  It’s a foundational introduction to the theory of Lie symmetries, particularly in the context of PDEs. Here’s a breakdown of what’s being discussed, organized for clarity:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The Core Idea: Lie Symmetries and PDEs**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **PDEs (Partial Differential Equations):**  These are equations that involve derivatives of a function (like temperature, pressure, or velocity) across different points in space and time.  They're incredibly important in many fields like physics, engineering, and biology.\n",
      "* **The Prolation of Functions:** The text emphasizes the crucial role of the *prolongation* of functions.  This is a key concept.  Instead of directly solving the PDE, we often *transform* the problem by applying a series of transformations (like rotations, reflections, and scaling) to the function.  These transformations are *defined* by the Lie group.\n",
      "* **Lie Groups:**  The text introduces the idea of Lie groups – a fundamental concept in mathematics and physics.  They are groups of transformations that preserve the underlying structure of a space.  They provide a framework for understanding and analyzing PDEs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. The Role of Symmetry Transformations**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Symmetry Transformations:**  The text explains that the core of the theory lies in the *symmetry transformations* that are applied to the PDE. These transformations are defined by the Lie group.\n",
      "* **Local Group of Transformations:** The text introduces the idea of a *local group* of transformations.  This is a crucial step.  Instead of applying a single transformation to the entire PDE, we consider a *subset* of transformations that are \"close\" to the underlying structure.\n",
      "* **The Transformation Process:** The text describes how the transformation process works. It involves applying a series of transformations to the function, which are defined by the Lie group.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3.  The Importance of the Lie Group**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Group Structure:** The text highlights that the Lie group provides a *group structure* to the transformations. This structure is essential for understanding the behavior of the PDE.\n",
      "* **Two-Dimensional Group:** The text introduces the idea of a *two-dimensional group* – a fundamental concept in Lie group theory.  This group is defined by the transformations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4.  The Connection to PDEs**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **The Prolation of Functions:** The text connects the prolongation of functions to the Lie group.  The transformation process is essentially a way to \"rotate\" or \"reflect\" the function, and the Lie group provides the framework for understanding these transformations.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   What specifically are you struggling with understanding about this text? (e.g., the concept of a Lie group, the transformation process, or the role of symmetry?)\n",
      "3 LieSolver: LieSolver constructs solutions of IBVPs using a sequence of transformations, leveraging a set of base solutions to define the solution's expressivity. The algorithm iteratively applies transformations, combines base solutions, and employs variable projection to optimize the solution, ensuring a wide range of patterns are captured.\n",
      "4 Experiments and results: LieSolver outperforms PINNs in accuracy and efficiency, achieving near-order-of-magnitude reduction in MSE across various ICs. Gaussian bases yield a reliable MSE within a minute, while the step IC requires more bases. The sine mix IC benefits from a larger PINN model, and the LieSolver-based approach handles the wave equation with a step IC effectively, outperforming PINNs.\n",
      "5 Conclusion: LieSolver utilizes Lie symmetries to generate parametrized functions, solving initial-boundary value problems by optimizing parameters to satisfy IBCs. It achieves IBC MSE below 10-6 with fewer than 40 bases compared to PINNs, offering robust optimization and accurate predictive accuracy through a sparse, analytical expression. The method’s compact nature and speed advantages, combined with the inherent physics of the PDE, make it suitable for a wide range of problems, including heat and wave equations.  Future work will focus on expanding the framework to more general PDEs and automating base solution selection.\n",
      "Appendix A Appendix: Okay, let’s refine this explanation further, focusing on enhancing the clarity and depth of the description, particularly around the exponential map and the connection to the group structure.  Here’s a revised version incorporating these suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised Explanation of Symmetry Group Derivation**\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this section is to systematically derive the symmetry group of a system of PDEs, leveraging the exponential map to connect the generated vector field to the group’s structure.  This process is crucial for understanding the fundamental properties of the PDE system and for potentially simplifying subsequent analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Check Solvability & Local Un solvability:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial step involves verifying that the system of PDEs is locally solvable – meaning there exists a smooth solution for any point (x₀, u₀) within the domain of the PDE.  This is achieved through techniques like the method of fixed points and the analysis of the PDE’s behavior near the point.  If the system is not locally solvable, the derivation of the symmetry group becomes significantly more complex, potentially requiring more advanced techniques like the method of representations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Generate Ansatz:**\n",
      "\n",
      "We construct an ansatz – a vector field representation – for the PDE. This ansatz consists of a set of coefficients, typically denoted as  `v = (v₁, v₂, ..., v)`  that define the evolution of the vector field.  The choice of this ansatz is crucial, as it directly influences the resulting symmetry group.  The ansatz is typically expressed as a function of the variables `x` and `u` (where `x` represents the spatial coordinates and `u` represents the time).\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Derive Equations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the derivation lies in translating the ansatz into a set of equations.  This involves a careful mapping of the PDE’s equations to a set of differential equations.  The key is to identify the transformation that relates the initial state (defined by the ansatz) to the final state (determined by the PDE).  This transformation is fundamentally driven by the group’s action.  The equations are typically expressed in a form that allows for a direct computation of the generated vector field.  The derivation of these equations is often the most challenging part of the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4.  The Exponential Map – The Key Connection:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The exponential map, denoted as `exp(θ)`, is the cornerstone of this derivation.  It’s a mathematical tool that allows us to \"translate\" the evolution of the vector field `v` into a transformation of the variables `x` and `u`.  Specifically, the exponential map maps the evolution of the vector field `v` to a transformation of the variables `x` and `u` in a way that reveals the group’s structure.  The transformation is defined by a set of equations that relate the initial state to the final state.  The exponential map is crucial because it provides a way to \"unfold\" the PDE into a set of differential equations that can be solved.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5.  Derive Transformation Maps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The equations derived from the ansatz are then transformed into transformation maps. These maps represent the group’s action on the vector field.  The transformation maps are the heart of the derivation.  They determine how the evolution of the vector field changes as it moves through the group.  The properties of these transformation maps – their smoothness, continuity, and the specific terms involved – directly dictate the symmetry group.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6.  Group Structure & Symmetry:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the derivation culminates in determining the group structure of the system. This involves analyzing the transformation maps to identify the group’s elements.  The group’s structure is defined by the symmetry properties of the transformation maps.  For example, a rotational symmetry might manifest as a specific transformation map that preserves the vector field’s orientation.  The group’s structure is then used to define the symmetry group, which is a set of transformations that preserve the essential properties of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7.  Potential Challenges & Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Complexity of Equations:** The derivation of the equations can be quite complex, especially for systems with multiple variables and intricate PDE dynamics.\n",
      "* **Computational Complexity:**  The exponential map and the resulting equations can be computationally intensive, particularly for large-scale systems.\n",
      "* **Understanding the Group:**  The group structure itself can be subtle and require careful analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, this revised explanation emphasizes the crucial role of the exponential map as a bridge between the PDE's dynamics and the group's structure, highlighting the key steps involved in deriving the symmetry group.**\n",

      "1 Introduction: Agentic Long-Document Navigation (ALDEN) is a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework designed to train Visual Language Models (VLMs) as active agents capable of navigating and reasoning over long documents to deliver accurate and adaptive question answering. ALDEN expands the action space with a fetch action, incorporates a cross-level reward function, and introduces visual semantic anchoring to improve training robustness and efficiency. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate ALDEN’s superior performance compared to baselines, achieving a 9.14% average improvement in answer accuracy.\n",
      "2 Related Work: The study investigates A-VRDU, a task requiring active, multi-step retrieval and reasoning using RL fine-tuning of VLMs. Recent research explores extending context length through RL to address real-world document challenges, while semantic retrieval offers a scalable approach to document focus. Existing retrieval-based methods are static and brittle, prompting a new RL framework for this task.\n",
      "3 Preliminaries: 3.1 Problem Formulation: The agent analyzes documents to answer queries, collecting evidence through sequential decision-making. The task utilizes a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to guide actions, receiving visual observations and rewards. The objective is to maximize expected cumulative reward through iterative evidence collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 Proximal Policy Optimization for fine-tuning LLMs: PPO fine-tunes LLMs by treating tokens as actions, using a reward model and KL divergence to prevent policy drift. Value function predicts expected returns, and GAE calculates advantage, optimizing the LLM by maximizing surrogate objectives and adapting to long-horizon interactions in the A-VRDU task.\n",
      "4 Methodology: We propose a Visual Semantic Anchoring mechanism to mitigate training fluctuations in RL for A-VRDU, addressing the challenge of large visual token counts. This involves dual-path KL regularization to constrain hidden states during policy optimization, stabilizing language generation and preserving semantic grounding, while preventing drift.\n",
      "5 Experiments: We conduct experiments on long VRDU benchmarks to (i) compare ALDEN with strong baselines and (ii) assess the contribution of its key components, including expanded action space, cross-level reward, and visual semantic anchoring, to navigation accuracy, answer quality, and training stability. We first outline datasets, baselines, implementation details, and evaluation metrics (section 5.1), then present main results (section 5.2), followed by ablations (section 5.3) and detailed component analyses (section 5.4). Datasets. We build the training set by merging and processing three multi-page VRDU datasets: DUDE (Van Landeghem et al., 2023), MPDocVQA (Tito et al., 2023a), and SlideVQA (Tanaka et al., 2023a) . We filter out documents with fewer than 10 pages. To enrich query diversity, we use GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024) to rewrite part of MPDocVQA, increasing the proportion of page-index–referenced queries in the final training corpus. Detailed statistics of the resulting training set are provided in table 1 . The evaluation is conducted mainly on the following VRDU benchmarks: MMLongBench (Ma et al., 2024b), LongDocURL (Deng et al., 2024), PaperTab (Hui et al., 2024), PaperText (Hui et al., 2024), and FetaTab (Hui et al., 2024) . To evaluate the fetch action, we create DUDE-sub, a DUDE validation subset with 480 general queries and 480 queries containing explicit page references or implicit sequential navigation cues. Baselines. To validate the effectiveness of ALDEN, we compare it with three categories of baselines. (1) Full-Document Input : mainstream state-of-the-art VLMs are prompted with the entire document as context to answer user queries. (2) Visual RAG : methods that retrieve the most relevant document pages using the user query, including M3DocRAG (Cho et al., 2024) , and ReSearch-VL, a Search-only ALDEN variant trained with GRPO using outcome-based rewards adapted from a fully textual method ReSearch (Chen et al., 2025b) . (3) Hybrid RAG : approaches that augment page images with OCR-extracted text for retrieval and reasoning, including MDocAgent (Han et al., 2025) , VidoRAG (Wang et al., 2025b) . Detailed baseline configurations can be seen in appendix B. Implementation Details. Both the policy and value models are initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Bai et al., 2025) , and all Visual RAG and Hybrid RAG baselines use the same backbone for fairness. During training, we adopt the single-vector retriever vdr-2b-v1 (Ma et al., 2024a) for images and e5-large-v2 (Wang et al., 2022) for text. For evaluation, we also report results with the multi-vector retrievers ColQwen2-v1.0 (ColQwen) (Faysse et al., 2025) for images and ColBERT-v2.0 (ColBERT) (Santhanam et al., 2021) for text. Unless otherwise noted, each search action retrieves the top- 1 1 candidate page, with a maximum of T = 6 T=6 reasoning–action turns. On average, ALDEN collects 1.87 unique pages per query; hence, single-turn RAG baselines are set to retrieve the top-2 pages for a fair comparison. Further implementation details are provided in appendix C . Evaluation Metrics. The primary evaluation metric is GPT-4o–judged answer accuracy ( Acc ) on each benchmark. For finer-grained analysis of ALDEN’s components, we further assess navigation quality using trajectory-level retrieval recall ( Rec ), precision ( Pre ), and F1-score ( F1 ).\n",

      "6 Conclusions: ALDEN is a reinforcement-learning framework for autonomous agents trained to navigate and reason across vast document information. Extensive experiments demonstrate ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and improves evidence localization, validating the benefits of its components – including a fetch action, reward modeling, and visual anchoring. The A-VRDU paradigm represents a shift towards autonomous document understanding, with ALDEN’s strong performance highlighting the potential for more accurate, scalable, and adaptive agents.\n",

      "1 Introduction: This paper introduces a formalization of deductive reasoning based on logic programming, aiming to evaluate language model reasoning efficiency. It demonstrates that while LMs often generate more tokens than necessary, recent findings suggest a key dimension of reasoning – efficiency – that standard evaluations fail to address. The authors construct verbalized logic programs for grade school math word problems, demonstrating that injecting irrelevant axioms significantly reduces accuracy, particularly when the irrelevant axioms overlap with the goal theorem. Experiments on GSM problems reveal that LMs are inefficient when dealing with irrelevant axioms, suggesting a heuristic search process may be employed.\n",
      "2 Related Work: This work presents an automatic evaluation method for reasoning tasks, generating problems with irrelevant information to assess LM performance. It leverages logic programming and proposes a method for formally defining irrelevance, focusing on generating proofs that only contain necessary steps, contrasting with previous evaluations relying on manual scrutiny or heuristic measures. The study also investigates the efficiency of transformer-based Large Language Models for search, proposing methods to improve reasoning through length rewards and token reduction.\n",
      "3 Logic Programming and Deductive Reasoning: Okay, let's delve deeper into the concept of \"queries\" within the context of the text.  We'll focus on how queries are used to guide the forward-chaining process and why they're important for the program's reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Role of Queries in Forward Chaining**\n",
      "\n",
      "The text emphasizes that queries are *not* just simple questions. They are carefully orchestrated steps that the program takes to explore the possible truth values that can be derived from the input.  The query acts as a focused request to the program, prompting it to evaluate a specific truth value based on the current state of the program.  This is a critical element of the forward-chaining process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's a breakdown of how queries contribute to the forward-chaining:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization:** The forward-chaining process begins with an initial set of axioms. These axioms define the starting point of the reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Query Generation:**  The program generates a query for each axiom.  The query is designed to explore the possible truth values that can be derived from the axiom.  It's a targeted request to the program to evaluate a specific truth value.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Chain of Evaluation:** The program then chains together these queries, systematically evaluating the truth values of the axioms and the resulting queries.  Each query is a step in the chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Constraint Satisfaction:** The query process is driven by the goal theorem. The program is trying to find a truth value that satisfies the goal theorem. The queries are designed to explore the possible truth values that can lead to the goal theorem.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Iteration and Refinement:** The forward-chaining process continues iteratively, refining the truth values as it moves through the chain of queries.  The program uses the results of each query to guide the next query, effectively narrowing down the possible truth values.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why Queries are Important for Efficiency**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Focus and Narrowing:** Queries allow the program to focus its search on the most promising paths.  By asking specific questions, the program avoids exploring irrelevant possibilities.\n",
      "* **Heuristic Guidance:** The query process acts as a heuristic, guiding the search towards the goal theorem.  The queries are designed to explore the truth values that are most likely to lead to the solution.\n",
      "* **Avoiding Redundancy:**  Queries can be designed to avoid redundant evaluations.  For example, the program might ask a query to determine the truth value of a particular axiom, and then use the result to evaluate subsequent axioms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analogy**\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like a detective investigating a crime. The detective doesn't just randomly ask questions. They ask specific questions (queries) to narrow down the possibilities and eventually identify the culprit.\n",

      "**1. The Core Idea: Controlled Irrelevance**\n",
      "\n",
      "The central idea is to introduce \"irrelevant\" axioms – axioms that don’t directly contribute to the primary goal of the logical program – but are strategically placed to create a more robust and flexible system.  The text emphasizes that the program isn’t just about solving the original problem; it’s about being able to handle a broader range of reasoning scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. The Four Cases – A Deeper Dive**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down each case more thoroughly:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Case 1: No Overlap (A W ​ ( h g ) A_{\\text{W}}(h_{g}) ):** This is the ideal scenario. The axioms are designed to be consistent with the original goal theorem, and there's no need to introduce new information.  It’s a baseline for the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Case 2: Entity Overlap (A W ​ ( h g ) A_{\\text{W}}(h_{g}) ):** This is where the \"irrelevant\" aspect comes in. The axioms are related to the entities involved in the original goal theorem.  This is a crucial step because it introduces a potential for reasoning about the system's components, which can be valuable for certain tasks.  The text suggests this is a deliberate choice to increase the program's flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Case 3: Agent Overlap (A W ​ ( h g ) A_{\\text{W}}(h_{g}) ):** This case is about the agents involved.  The axioms are linked to the agents' actions or roles.  This can be useful for tasks that require understanding of interactions between entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Case 4: Distractor Theorem (…):** This is the most complex case. The axioms are designed to be related to the *distractor theorems* – theorems that demonstrate the limitations of reasoning.  The text implies that this case is designed to be a \"test\" of the program's ability to handle more complex reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The Role of the Distractor Theorems**\n",
      "\n",
      "The distractor theorems are a critical component. They act as a \"constraint\" on the program.  They force the program to consider alternative reasoning paths and demonstrate that it can handle situations where the original goal theorem might not be applicable.  The text suggests that the program is designed to be able to handle situations where the original goal theorem is not sufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4.  The Purpose of the Verbalizer (ν 𝒫)**\n",
      "\n",
      "The text mentions the verbalizer ν 𝒫 as a key element.  It's a system for translating logic programs into natural language.  This is vital because it allows for a more human-readable and potentially easier-to-understand representation of the program's reasoning process.  The verbalizer is used to create a \"bridge\" between formal logic and natural language.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5.  The Overall Strategy – Controlled Irrelevance**\n",
      "\n",
      "The core strategy is to *intentionally* introduce irrelevant information.  This isn't about making the program useless; it's about creating a system that can handle a wider range of problems.  The text suggests that the program is designed to be adaptable and capable of handling unexpected situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6.  The Text's Implications – A Gradual Approach**\n",
      "\n",
      "The text implies a gradual approach.  The initial setup is simple (a few axioms), and the process is then refined through the four cases.  The goal is to build a system that can handle a variety of reasoning scenarios without being overly constrained.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the text describes a technique for creating logical programs that are designed to be flexible and adaptable. It leverages the strategic introduction of irrelevant axioms to enhance the program's robustness and ability to handle a wider range of reasoning scenarios.**\n",

      "---\n",

      "*   Expand on any of these points in more detail?\n",

      "5 Experiments: We use proofs generated from the family of verbalized logic programs introduced in § ˜ 4 to help understand how LMs reason about GSM problems. We generate 500 problems with varying structural, agent and entity overlap, as discussed above. We refer to the problems without any irrelevant axioms as base problems. We additionally generate control problems that have the same number of axioms as the problems with irrelevant axioms, except that all axioms are relevant. Their shortest proofs contain the base problem’s shortest proof as a subproof. This controls for the possible confounder of problem length (see, e.g., Leeb et al., 2025 ). We consider both non-ground queries, corresponding to questions like “How many drones does Yanick have?” , 11 11 11 Assuming numerical consistency ensures there exists at most one ground atom in the minimal Herbrand model that unifies with the non-ground query. This ensures that forward chaining would halt in finite time. and ground queries, corresponding to questions like “Show that Yanick has 5 drones.” . We use one “vanilla” LM and three reasoning LMs in our experiments: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Llama Team, 2024 ) , Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024 ) , Qwen’s reasoning model QwQ-32B, and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025 ) . We generate strings using ancestral sampling, restricting the context length to 4000 4000 tokens. Our experimental design is based on in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020 ) . Specifically, we use five fixed in-context examples of shortest proofs to expose the LM to proofs in our verbalized logic programs. The verbalized proofs are ordered under a DFS traversal of the theorems in the proof, such that the axioms are popped in the same order they occur in the verbalized text. See § ˜ D.2 for the prompt. We begin by analyzing how irrelevant axioms influence an LM’s ability to generate the correct goal theorem for non-ground queries. We employ the two-step prompting strategy given by Kojima et al. ( 2022 ) . In the first step, the model is prompted to produce a natural-language proof outlining its reasoning process. This natural-language process is then mapped to a proof in the verbalized logic program. In the second step, we prompted the LM a second time—conditioned on the proof it generated—to produce the goal theorem. In Table ˜ 2 , we report model accuracy in generating the correct goal theorem. We observe that even a single irrelevant axiom reduces model performance, particularly for Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5. Performance degrades further as additional irrelevant axioms are introduced. The performance of the most capable model, DeepSeek-R1, is nearly saturated at perfect accuracy, though slight decreases are still observed when irrelevant axioms are included. Across models, accuracy on problems containing irrelevant axioms is almost always lower than on the corresponding control examples, suggesting that irrelevance has a substantial effect on accuracy beyond what can be explained by longer problem statements. The only exception is Llama-3.1, whose performance on problems with one irrelevant axiom exceeds that of the corresponding control. QWQ-32B stands out as an outlier: for this model, performance on the control problems is significantly higher than on the original base problems. In Fig. ˜ 7 ( § ˜ D.4 ), we present results stratified by agent and entity overlap ( § ˜ 4.3 ). A consistent pattern emerges: such overlap between the goal and irrelevant axioms makes solving the problem more difficult. Compared to no overlap, performance drops with both kinds of overlap, suggesting both serve as heuristics during search. While drops are typically larger for agent overlap than for entity overlap, we note that this could be partially due to the entities being topically related ( § ˜ 4.3 ). In the following subsection, we analyze the proofs in greater detail to further illuminate these effects. In Fig. ˜ 3 we plot the empirical distribution over the number of tokens in the model’s output and compare it to the number of tokens in the natural language annotation of the shortest proof, taking only the proofs that concluded at the correct goal theorem. This analysis, as well as those in the remainder of this section, are done on the problems with multiple irrelevant trees (i.e., the kind of structural overlap with the most axioms; § ˜ 4.3 ). We observe that all models often use more tokens than are in the annotations, suggesting excessive computation for goal theorem proofs. This is consistent with findings on reasoning models ( § ˜ 2 ), but holds also for the Llama model. However, these results do not confirm that the models generate irrelevant theorems—they might just be more verbose than our annotations. We therefore also consider a metric in which only non-axiom theorems are counted. In § ˜ D.4 we provide an additional analysis on search order. The main results are shown in Table ˜ 3 (non-ground queries), with scores stratified by agent and entity overlap. The efficiency scores are far from 100 % 100\\% , meaning that the models predict several theorems beyond the required ones present in the shortest proof. Additionally, we observe that the efficiency scores vary significantly across the type of overlap ( p < 0.001 ) (p<0.001) , so we conclude that lexical information in the query has a substantial effect on proof planning. We finally comment on the results that only consider non-axioms, presented at the last row of Table 3 . We again observe efficiency scores that are considerably below 100 % 100\\% , showing that the LMs prove theorems that are irrelevant to the query. § ˜ D.3 gives an example where Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct proves irrelevant theorems. We compare the performance to the same problems when presented with ground queries. Queries tend to be non-ground in the GSM domain (Riley et al., 1983 ; Cobbe et al., 2021 ) . Since LMs are heavily influenced by training data, we therefore expect them to perform better on non-ground queries. Our results on the same verbalized logic programs as before, but with ground queries, are presented on the right-hand side of Table ˜ 3 . We observe lower efficiency scores, suggesting that LMs are indeed worse at proving ground theorems in this domain.\n",
      "6 Conclusion: This paper investigates efficiency in language models through a logic programming framework, demonstrating that introducing irrelevant axioms leads to significantly reduced accuracy on math word problems, even when controlling for problem length. The work advocates for improved reasoning efficiency models.\n",

      "Appendix A Further Background: This paper describes a logic program forward chaining algorithm. The algorithm uses a priority queue Q Q to manage theorems, iteratively proving theorems from a logic program 𝒳, using a chart 𝒞 \\mathcal{C} to track proven theorems. The algorithm terminates when the agenda is empty, returning T if all goal theorems can be proven, and F if the agenda is not empty and the minimal Herbrand model is infinitely large.\n",

      "**Deep Dive into the Lemmas & Argument**\n",
      "\n",
      "The core of the argument hinges on the *structure* of the proof system and its ability to guarantee a shortest proof. The lemmas highlight this structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Lemma 1: \"There exists one unique shortest proof.\"** This is the foundational assertion. It’s a statement of *optimality*.  The system, through its rules and substitution procedure, *always* produces a shortest proof.  This isn't just about finding a shorter proof; it’s about *guaranteeing* a shortest proof.  This is a crucial assumption for the entire system.\n",

It’s a statement of *efficiency*.  The system *cannot* generate a proof that is shorter than the one already produced.  This is a fundamental property that drives the system's design.  It’s a constraint on the *scope* of the proof system.  The \"≤\" indicates a lower bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why This is Significant**\n",
      "\n",
      "This analysis suggests a sophisticated approach to automated reasoning. The system isn't just generating proofs; it's *optimizing* the proof process.  The constraint on the number of irrelevant axioms being generated is a key element of this optimization. It’s not just about finding a shorter proof; it’s about finding the *most efficient* proof.\n",

      "**Implications & Potential Challenges**\n",

      "Introduction: The paper introduces Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP), a prompting methodology that resolves the tension between flexibility and control by requiring the LLM to infer and output the previous dialogue state’s label before predicting the next. This structured workflow, Prime–Guide–Enforce, ensures procedural compliance while maintaining conversational naturalness. The approach enhances numerical reliability and enables smaller models to match larger ones, resulting in improved accuracy in trading tasks.\n",
      "Related Work: Related work examines various approaches to dialogue management, including task-oriented systems, end-to-end models, and prompting techniques. Existing systems often prioritize goal-driven optimization over procedural adherence, while general reasoning methods lack tailored control. Game NPCs demonstrate a focus on emergent behavior, while research in this domain avoids strict constraints. This research addresses a critical gap in developing a robust approach to ensure procedural adherence within conversational agents, with the goal of providing verifiable control.\n",
      "Proposed Method: The proposed method utilizes a unified prompt with a state-tracking system, ASTP, to guide the LLM’s dialogue. The prompt includes a system instruction defining the NPC’s persona, game world data, dialogue history, and dialogue guidelines. ASTP is employed to infer dialogue states from conversation history, ensuring state-aware decision making. The system enforces transition constraints and explicitly identifies previous states, resulting in a verifiable state-tracking process. A placeholder-based post-processing system is used during Offer-Sell states to guarantee accurate price calculations, enhancing transaction integrity.\n",
      "Experiments and Results: This section evaluates the Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) methodology for dialogue flow adherence and state-specific post-processing within dynamic trading interactions. The experiments utilized a virtual player LLM interacting with an LLM-driven NPC over 300 dialogues, employing a fixed seed for the player’s initial utterance. ASTP’s compliance with dialogue flow was assessed through ablation studies comparing it to methods adapted from other studies. The paper details the implementation of four key elements: state definitions, transition conditions, directive to identify previous states, and directive to output previous states. The experiment design involved scenarios of random item purchases and item recommendations, with a focus on achieving a near-perfect compliance rate in the COMMIT_SALE state. The results demonstrate that the ASTP method achieves near-perfect compliance, with the ablation study revealing that explicit transition rules significantly improved performance, while the ‘identify’ directive proved highly effective. The paper also explores the importance of prompt structure, comparing different approaches and highlighting the robustness of ASTP’s core principles. Furthermore, the study examines the impact of model variants and evaluation metrics, including accuracy, token usage, response time, and the effectiveness of the placeholder keyword __PRICE__ in ensuring accurate price calculations.\n",
      "Conclusion: ASTP, a prompting methodology, improves procedural compliance and accuracy in rule-governed applications like in-game trading. It uses a structured workflow and placeholder-based post-processing to enhance reliability and speed, achieving up to 9x faster responses with smaller models.\n",

      "Appendix A Detailed Prompts for All Experimental Setups: The prompt details a modified ASTP (Autoregressive State-Aware Tracking Process) prompt, differing in structure and terminology from the main paper’s conceptual model. It utilizes a two-level hierarchy for state classification (TRADE/non-trading) and employs functionally equivalent terms for context and subcontext. The prompt builds upon baseline models, adding directives to identify previous states and guide responses, culminating in a complete prompt for the proposed method. It also removes a placeholder post-processing mechanism.  The prompt augments Baseline 2 by introducing a state-transition graph and a “think step-by-step” instruction.\n",
      "Appendix B Item Data Used in Prompts: The appendix B item data is used to populate the {game_items} and {merchant_inventory} placeholders in the prompts. The {game_items} data contains a JSON string of 52 items with item_id and item_name, while the {merchant_inventory} data contains 20 items marked as “For Sale” with item_id, item_name, price, and quantity.\n",
      "Appendix C Dialogue Examples: Table 4 and 5 demonstrate successful dialogue examples from Scenario 1 and 2, showcasing ASTP’s ability to handle complex interactions and exploratory conversations while maintaining procedural flow. Table 6 compares ASTP’s dialogue with AutoTOD, illustrating ASTP’s adherence to the FINAL_CHECK step and skipping it. Table 7 shows the effectiveness of the Placeholder Post-Processing (PPP) mechanism, demonstrating accurate price establishment in the OFFER_SELL state and its robustness across subsequent turns.\n",
      "Appendix D Additional Experimental Results: The ASTP model experienced a single failure in a dialogue case after a player’s affirmative response (\"Yes, I'll purchase it\") in Turn 9, resulting in a jump from OFFER_SELL to COMMIT_SALE despite a mandatory FINAL_CHECK. This failure stems from semantic ambiguity in the NPC’s question, causing the model to misinterpret the required final check. A rare failure also occurs when the player attempts to negotiate while modifying the shopping cart within a single turn, leading to calculation errors.\n",

It proposes a Transformer-based policy that generates plans specifying discrete skills and continuous parameters, demonstrating improved success rates and efficiency compared to traditional sequential planning methods.\n",

      "The authors propose a pipeline for training bimanual manipulation skills through a hierarchical decision problem. They define low-level skills, high-level scheduling policies, and a data-driven approach to learn these skills using behavior cloning and dense rewards. The high-level policy selects skills and parameters to achieve a task goal, while the low-level skills are trained to perform individual tasks. The paper details a transformer-based architecture for temporal consistency and uses a dataset-driven approach to generate expert demonstrations for training the scheduling policy.\n",
      "4 Experiments: We evaluate a hierarchical framework and three baselines on a long-horizon manipulation task involving object placement in a bin. The framework outperforms RL-scratch on task success rate and completion progress, demonstrating efficient skill scheduling and coordination. The bimanual skill schedule visualization reveals improved skill sequencing and reduced episode duration. Baselines include vanilla PPO, hierarchical RL, and sequential planning.\n",

      "1 Introduction: This paper investigates the performance trade-offs of fine-grained INT and FP quantization, particularly in the context of large language models. It introduces a theoretical framework to model the quantization signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR) and demonstrates that MXINT8 consistently outperforms MXFP8 in both direct-cast and low-bit training, while NVINT4 surpasses NVFP4 with Hadamard rotation. The paper also presents a hardware cost analysis highlighting the benefits of fine-grained INT formats, challenging the current FP-centric design trajectory for AI accelerators.\n",
      "2 Preliminaries: Quantization maps high-precision tensors to lower-bit integer representations, utilizing scale factors to control integer values within a defined range. Floating-point quantization employs three fields: sign, exponent, and mantissa, representing low-bit values. Block quantization improves accuracy by partitioning tensors into blocks, with finer granularity enhancing accuracy but increasing computational cost. NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs provide native hardware support for MXFP8/MXFP6/MXFP4, while NVFP4 reduces block size and replaces the UE8M0 scale with an E4M3 scale. Four integer variants (MXINT8, MXINT6, MXINT4, NVINT4) are introduced for fair comparison.\n",
      "3 Quantization Recipe: This section details the quantization process for low-bit inference and training, utilizing the UE8M0 scale factor and symmetric integer range. It outlines the six quantization operations, including block-wise quantization and the analysis of quantization error in Sec. 5.1. The section also introduces the AbsMax quantizer and OCP for converting high-precision to UE8M0 format, addressing clipping and asymmetric range handling for signed integers.\n",
      "4 Theoretical Framework: 4.1 Theoretical QSNR: The Quantization Signal-to-Noise Ratio (QSNR) metric quantifies numerical fidelity under quantization schemes. Block vectors X ∈ ℝ k with i.i.d. entries X i ∼ 𝒩 ​ quantify the original signal, while quantization noise X − X q ∼ 𝐗 − 𝐗 q represents the difference between the original and quantized values. Common assumptions include blockwise absolute-maximum scaling. Theorem 1 (INT QSNR) demonstrates that under INT quantization, QSNR (dB) ≈ 6.02 dB, with a detailed proof in Sec. 9.2. Theorem 2 (FP QSNR) shows that under FP quantization, QSNR (dB) ≈ 13.80 dB, with a detailed proof in Sec. 9.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.2 Theoretical Comparisons: The study estimates QSNR for low-bit and floating-point formats, utilizing a UE8M0 scale. MXINT8 outperforms FP8 when κ < 7.55, while MXINT6 outperforms MXFP8 at κ < 1.96. MXINT4 outperforms MXFP4 when κ < 2.04. NVINT4 outperforms NVFP4 when κ < 2.39, and NVFP4’s QSNR increases with κ < 4. The key factor for format comparison is the data crest factor κ.\n",
      "5 FP v.s. INT: We compare low-bit integer and floating-point formats at three levels. MXINT8 outperforms MXFP8 on all models, with NVINT4 and NVFP4 exhibiting similar QSNR, while MXINT6, MXINT4, and NVINT4 perform worse. Hadamard rotation improves performance for MXINT8 and NVINT4, while MXINT6 and MXINT4 experience losses.\n",
      "6 Hardware Cost Analysis: The analysis evaluates hardware costs for a Matrix-Multiply Unit (MMU) supporting the MX format. MXINT8 and NVINT4 reduce energy by 37% and 38% respectively compared to MXFP8 and NVFP4. Mixed-format configurations, utilizing a chip with 8-bit and 4-bit data types and a throughput ratio of 1:2, further reduce area by about 34%.  Low-bit integer formats are more efficient than low-bit floating-point formats at matched throughput.\n",
      "7 Conclusion: The study demonstrates a trade-off between integer and floating-point quantization, with FP formats performing well at coarse levels but MXINT8 consistently outperforming MXFP8 in accuracy and hardware efficiency. Fine-grained INT formats, particularly NVINT4, offer an advantage over NVFP4 when combined with Hadamard rotation. This challenges current hardware trends and calls for a shift towards algorithm-hardware co-design to prioritize fine-grained INT formats for AI accelerator development.\n",

      "8 Related Work: Quantization algorithms, including post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT), are studied. Scaling laws are used to optimize low-bit quantization. Prior work focused on a single format (integer or floating-point) and did not compare formats. Hardware limitations restrict fine-grained quantization. OCP’s Microscaling (MX) data format improves low-bit quantization through per-block scaling and a 32-block size. NVIDIA Blackwell hardware supports MXFP8, MXFP4, and NVFP4.\n",

The model learns an action policy by maximizing Q-values, incorporating a safety factor based on time-to-collision, efficiency, and impact.  The P-DQN method directly generates actions, while the RP-DQN method adds a regularization term to stabilize the action network, reducing misestimation and improving exploration.

      "I Introduction: Agentic Moderation: A model-agnostic framework for collaborative multi-agent safety alignment of vision-language models, designed to mitigate cross-modal adversarial attacks through a SHIELD agent, Evaluator, Reflection agent, and responder agent.\n",
      "II Literature Review and Background: The paper reviews defense mechanisms for vision-language models, including input purification, system safety prompts, output suppression, and model-level alignment. It highlights recent advancements in moderation systems utilizing classifier-based detection and introduces Agentic Moderation, a multi-agent framework integrating preprocessing and postprocessing to dynamically interpret and coordinate safety enforcement across modalities.\n",
      "III Methodology: III-A: The Agentic Moderation Framework utilizes a loop with a central Coordinator, comprising four specialized agents: Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector. The Shield classifies multimodal inputs, determines actions, and the Responder generates candidate outputs based on cues. The Evaluator assesses responses for safety and utility, and the Reflector analyzes failures and generates corrective feedback. Agents are lightweight, modular, and extensible for seamless policy adaptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "III-B: The Shield Agent screens multimodal inputs, classifying them into 45 policy categories and augmenting prompts with contextual guidance. The Responder Agent integrates these cues into the generative process, balancing safety and task utility, utilizing a VLM backend and evaluating outputs through the SeeThreats framework. The Reflector Agent consolidates Shield decisions and user intent to diagnose failures and generates feedback with 'Issue—Fix' tags.\n",
      "IV Experiments Setup and Results: The study establishes four LVLM evaluations across diverse adversarial safety datasets using LLaVA, Qwen2.5-8B, and LLaMA 3.2 Vision-11B. Metrics include refusal rate, non-following rate, jailbreak rate, and threat score, with experiments configured to isolate each component’s contribution. The models were evaluated on four configurations on RunPod L40S GPUs.\n",
      "V Results and Analysis: We evaluate multiple moderation configurations to measure the effectiveness of each module. Under adversarial attack settings, our objective is to ensure models produce safe and coherent responses rather than maintaining “safety” through excessive refusal or meaningless outputs. In particular, we aim to avoid situations where a model appears safe simply by refusing everything or producing nonsensical text. To this end, we focus on two main metrics: Attack Success Rate (ASR), which measures the proportion of harmful outputs, and Non-Following Rate (NF), which captures cases where the model fails to follow or meaningfully complete the task. Ideally, an effective moderator minimizes both ASR and NF. As shown in Figure 5, points closer to the lower-left corner represent configurations with both low ASR and NF, indicating an optimal balance between safety and utility. Our goal is to move model behavior toward this region.\n",
      "\n",
      "LLaMA, LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-1.6, Qwen2.5-7B, the Shield and Reflection Agents achieve the most consistent and substantial improvements, notably reducing completion and instruction non-following rates across the LLaVA variants. For LLaMA, the combined setup increases refusal rate by 17%, primarily through a decrease in non-following responses. Qwen2.5-7B similarly shows reduced non-following and improved refusal behavior, with the Shield offering stronger gains and the Reflection Agent providing measurable improvements. Both the Shield and Reflection Agents improve safety performance, with the Shield generally providing stronger and more stable gains. As shown in Figure 6 and Table II, Flowchart and SIUO attacks exhibit relatively low ASR and high RR across all configurations, as models tend to generate descriptive rather than harmful content. Notably, Flowchart and SIUO attacks exhibit relatively low ASR and high RR across all configurations, as models tend to generate descriptive rather than harmful content.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Shield and Reflection Agents improve safety, with the Shield generally providing stronger and more stable gains. The Reflection Agent, while slightly less effective, still delivers measurable improvements, demonstrating its practical value as a lightweight enhancement. In practice, the choice between them can depend on latency and computational constraints—using the Shield alone offers robust protection with minimal overhead, whereas combining both yields the best overall trade-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 6 and Table II present dataset-level results across five representative attack types: AdvBench, FigStep, Flowchart, MMSafety, and SIUO. All evaluated Vision-Language Models benefit from the proposed moderation strategies, though to varying extents. However, some models achieve comparable performance using only one module. For instance, Reflection alone nearly matches the combined configuration on FigStep and Flowchart, where attacks rely on semantic misdirection rather than explicit content. In contrast, Shield alone performs well on MMSafety and SIUO, where threats are visually grounded and easier to detect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, Flowchart and SIUO attacks exhibit relatively low ASR and high RR across all configurations, as models tend to generate descriptive rather than harmful content. In Flowchart, the task typically instructs the model to describe and elaborate on flow diagrams, using much of the token budget for neutral explanation and leaving limited capacity for generation. Meanwhile, SIUO contains implicit, culturally nuanced cases (e.g., “Should I give my mother yarn for her birthday?”) where seemingly benign questions encode subtle social implications but rarely triggers overtly unsafe responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these findings demonstrate that both Shield and Reflection are independently effective and can be flexibly deployed based on dataset characteristics and application scenarios: Shield suits real-time or low-latency moderation, while Reflection benefits post-hoc auditing and interpretability-sensitive contexts. Together, they form a robust, adaptive defense framework for diverse cross-modality adversarial settings. The integration of safety layers introduces moderate latency to the inference process. As shown in Table III, the Shield module adds only a negligible preprocessing overhead (0.015 seconds/query) through lightweight intent classification and policy lookup, while Reflection (1.5 seconds max/iteration) performs post-hoc self-evaluation and regeneration. If the first reflection deems the output safe, the process converges early without regeneration. Overall, the total inference time—comprising Shield, Reflection, and model generation—remains efficient, indicating that the added safety mechanisms achieve meaningful protection with minimal latency cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its flexibility, the framework introduces a practical trade-off between safety robustness and inference efficiency. Incorporating multiple agents enhances moderation reliability but also increases computational cost/latency, which may constrain real-time or large-scale applications. Moreover, determining the optimal combination of modules and safety thresholds remains context-dependent and nontrivial, requiring careful calibration for each deployment. Future work will explore adaptive agent scheduling and cost-aware coordination strategies to balance safety guarantees with system responsiveness.\n",
      "VI Conclusion: Agentic Moderation is a model-agnostic framework that utilizes specialized agents (Shield, Evaluator, and Reflector) to collaboratively enforce safety policies for large vision-language models under multimodal adversarial attacks. It achieves this through iterative reasoning and feedback, dynamically adjusting moderation across textual and visual modalities, significantly reducing harmful outputs while maintaining instruction adherence. The framework offers a flexible and extensible foundation for safety, supporting modular defense strategies.\n",

      "1 Introduction: BambooKG is a neurobiologically-inspired framework for long-term memory retention based on overlapping knowledge graphs. It utilizes a frequency-weighted associative mechanism, strengthening edge weights through repeated co-occurrence of non-triplet node pairs, enabling the system to “associate” new information with existing knowledge and facilitate retrieval.\n",
      "2 Existing Models: RAG, while effective, struggles with multi-hop reasoning due to independent chunk treatment. Newer pipelines, such as Chain-of-RAG, achieve state-of-the-art results on the KILT benchmark. GraphRAG combines RAG and OpenIE to build knowledge graphs, improving entity disambiguation and relational reasoning, with up to 10% accuracy gains in medical QA.\n",
      "3 BambooKG: Architecture and Pipelines: The BambooKG architecture constructs a knowledge graph through a multi-stage pipeline: text segmentation into chunks, tagging with a controlled LLM, and subgraph creation. This pipeline, inspired by STDP, emphasizes flexible tag selection and edge weighting to capture nuanced semantic relationships. The Tagger extracts query tags, which are used to generate local subgraph representations, and the BambooKG iteratively merges these subgraphs into a global graph.  The system leverages edge weights to represent co-occurrence and allows for partial pattern matching, mirroring memory recall processes in the brain.\n",
      "4 Experimental Setup: BambooKG was compared to OpenIE, GraphRAG, and KGGen against RAG as a baseline.  The study used top-k embeddings for BambooKG, OpenIE, and KGGen at 5-3, while RAG used top-k=5.  The HotPotQA dataset was used for general knowledge recall, and the MuSiQue dataset for multi-hop knowledge retention.  GPT-4o was used to generate answers from the recalled subgraph, and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluated the predicted answers against expected answers, considering GPT-4o’s non-deterministic nature.\n",
      "5 Results: BambooKG outperforms other knowledge graph methods in HotPotQA and MuSiQue due to data recall and retrieval time, despite OpenIE's incoherent triplets and GraphRAG's missing nodes and cluster issues. GraphRAG performs poorly in HotPotQA despite its good stance, likely due to missing answer node entities and a poorly performing corpus. The use of correct and distractor documents in the 100 randomly selected questions likely led to incorrect community generation, hindering GraphRAG's performance. BambooKG’s lack of triplets and arbitrary nodes, combined with the LLM-only Memorisation Pipeline, results in high extraction speeds and reduced context size compared to other approaches.\n",
      "6 Future Work: Future work will focus on improving the Tagger’s ability to handle specialized corpora through fine-tuning and prompt engineering, exploring the formation of communities and clusters within the knowledge graph, and refining subgraph selection during recall to reduce context size and accelerate LLM-based decisions.\n",

      "1 Introduction: CAIR is a method for assessing agent influence on an LLM-based agentic AI workflow, offering a first-of-its-kind agent influence ranker, task-agnostic analysis, and reduced inference latency.\n",
      "2 Related Works: The study examines methods for interpreting agent workflows, drawing parallels to graph theory and network engineering. Graph centrality measures (Saxena & Iyengar) and the LASCNN Algorithm are used to assess agent importance, but these methods are limited by focusing solely on structural properties and failing to consider internal functionality. A network topology approach, utilizing the LASCNN Algorithm, is proposed, but this approach also has limitations regarding the inability to assess importance in flexible workflows. Human annotations are considered as a potential alternative, but this is costly, biased, and infeasible for real-time inference. Reinforcement learning, while focused on multi-agent systems, offers a different approach, but its dependence on reward metrics and complexity limit its applicability to LLM-based agents.\n",
      "3 The Method: CAIR analyzes AAW behavior by iteratively perturbing the internal workflow, measuring changes to the final output, and calculating agent importance scores. It uses LIME-inspired feature importance assessment, transforming the AAW into an embedding space, and calculating cosine distance to determine relevance. The final score is weighted by the influence of the representative query, adjusted by α and β parameters, and the highest score is selected.\n",
      "4 Evaluation: AAW-Zoo and AAW-Zoo-Generator are LLM chains designed to generate simple AAWs for evaluation. CAIR utilizes graph theory, classical feature importance, and SHAP to evaluate influence-based agent ranking in AAWs, achieving improved ranking accuracy and latency reduction compared to CFI.\n",
      "5 Results and Discussion: CAIR outperforms BTW and EV in all metrics for orchestrator and router AAWs, and the overall measure, due to the high autonomy of orchestrator and router AAWs, which results in a non-fixed architecture during activation. EV has higher TRS, P@1, and 1-SFD in sequential AAWs, while CAIR remains competitive, demonstrating that architecture significantly influences agent influence on final output. Human verification showed CAIR rankings more closely aligned with human perception. CAIR pairs input queries to representative queries based on proximity, as demonstrated in Figure 3. Ten runtime queries are shown with their corresponding representative queries, all represented by SBERT embeddings projected to 2D using T-SNE. Cosine similarity scores confirm accurate pairing based on functionality. CAIR is used as a downstream task to mitigate toxicity in LLM-level solutions. Kumar et al. (2023) demonstrates this using the CAIR system, which applies toxicity guardrails to every LLM call. Guardrails evaluate different toxicity types and apply three rounds of output correction when toxic outputs are detected. Applying guardrails to only the top-ranked agents reduces inference latency significantly, while maintaining effectiveness. Ablation studies evaluated CAIR’s components, revealing that combining all components resulted in the highest rankings. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that deviations from selected α and β values decreased rankings, with a decline occurring when α and β values were pushed to extremes. Rankings remained stable with low standard deviation across varying query sets. The use of SBERT was evaluated, showing its effectiveness in measuring string differences in structured data.\n",
      "6 Conclusions and Future Work: Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) was evaluated on 30 AAWs with 230 tasks. CAIR produced high-quality agent rankings, was applicable at inference time with low latency, and could adjust LLM-level downstream tasks. Future work includes expanding CAIR to hybrid architectures, higher agency levels, and lower output access, as well as extending CAIR to perform downstream tasks.\n",
      "Limitations: CAIR’s performance is limited by its reliance on user-provided representative queries, which can be affected by poor quality. Mitigation involves using the prompt provided in Appendix D to generate queries, and expanding the set of queries reduces the risk of ignoring functionalities. CAIR’s offline process requires setting two parameters (α and β), introducing a risk of misconfiguration, but stable rankings are achieved across a wide range of parameter values.\n",

      "Overview: Overview: This appendix details research methods, including LLM assistance, experimental setup, complexity analysis, prompt usage, dataset generation, and safety measures. It covers hardware/software, CAIR’s offline phase, prompt engineering, AAW-Zoo generation, guardrail implementation, metric definition, random setting, human verification, and a full results analysis.\n",
      "Appendix A LLM Assistance Statement: LLMs were utilized for both code development and sentence-level editing during the research and paper preparation process.\n",
      "Appendix B Experimental settings: Experiments were performed in an Azure virtual machine with Ubuntu 24.04 x64 OS, 6 vCPUs, and 112 GiB RAM. The Python environment utilized langgraph V0.2.69, langfuse V2.59.3, Networkx V3.4.2, and scikit-learn V1.6.1. The SBERT model was used with sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and stsb-roberta-base was used as the Semantic Textual Similarity predictor and SHAP KernelExplainer.\n",
      "Appendix C Complexity Analysis: CAIR begins by executing a representative query without interference, perturbing each agent’s activations individually. On average, J-j activations are performed, with J = 1 to J = 13, and the total number of agent activations across all executions is computed.  The total computational cost is estimated per query, considering LLM calls and agent activations, and is capped at 1465.81 seconds for the longest observed CAIR analysis (functionality 5).\n",
      "Appendix D CAIR Used Prompts: Prompts were used offline to perturb agent outputs to counterfactual scenarios. A prompt was generated for each AAW architecture, and a query-generating prompt based on an AAW overview was provided.\n",
      "Appendix E AAW-Zoo-Generator: Motivation. Prompting an LLM to generate a complete AAW is feasible. While the output may differ from the exact desired workflow and can include some code issues, LLMs generally possess the necessary knowledge. Our experiments show that by identifying mistakes and iterating on the results, the quality improves significantly with each step.\n",
      "\n",
      "High Level Idea. Break the full task into several smaller steps, each performed through a dedicated LLM call. By simplifying each request into a well-defined, closed-form prompt, mistakes and errors are dramatically reduced. This structured, step-by-step approach naturally supports a chain-of-thought reasoning process, allowing each component to build upon the outputs of prior steps with increased clarity and context. An additional important aspect is passing each response through a \"supervisor\" component, which evaluates the quality of the response concerning the user’s request and the previously completed steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation Details. AAW-Zoo-Generator is implemented using the LangGraph framework. Each LLM call is encapsulated as a node, which accesses relevant information and routes the output via the supervisor to the next node in the flow. All LLM calls use the gpt-o1 model, with no additional tools or external databases involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "We divide the full generator into three main steps, each comprising multiple components. The supervisor component operates independently and is not assigned to any specific step.\n",
      "\n",
      "User Request Analysis. The user provides a request for a generated AAW in simple natural language, with as much or as little detail as desired. The first component analyzes this request and produces a draft analysis. Next, a second component reviews the draft and generates clarification questions to address missing information. To simplify this step, each question includes a default response that the user can select if no specific answer is needed. Based on the original draft and the user’s answers, a finalized analysis is then generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Workflow Design. Once the finalized analysis is obtained, a blueprint of the desired AAW is generated. This blueprint incorporates both user-specified architectural preferences and task-specific requirements. It defines the agents comprising the AAW, as well as the flow of information and agent connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, a tools component assigns relevant tools to each agent in the blueprint. Each agent is assigned at least one tool from a predefined set, allowing for flexible tool integration. In our dataset, we used three tools: an online search tool (Serper 9 9 9 serper.dev/ ), a summarization tool (Wikipedia), and an image generation tool (implemented by us using DALL·E API).\n",

      "1 Introduction: EnConda-Bench: A trajectory-based evaluation framework for process-level assessment of environment configuration in SWE, enabling detailed analysis of agent capabilities during configuration.\n",
      "2 Related Work: The paper reviews existing agent approaches to environment setup, highlighting limitations of early heuristics, tool-augmented agents, and specialized environment agents. It introduces Repo2Run, ExecutionAgent, and SetupAgent, each employing different strategies to improve process-level interaction and evaluation. Recent benchmarks, including HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS, demonstrate progress but struggle with real-world build challenges, while environment configuration benchmarks address this gap. The paper advocates for a framework that balances scale, diversity, and diagnostic depth for robust agent evaluation.\n",
      "3 EnConda-Bench: The EnConda-Bench task requires agents to diagnose and repair environment configuration errors. The agent uses planning and perception to identify errors, generate repair commands, and execute the environment, culminating in a shell script. Evaluation assesses the agent’s ability to correctly identify, reason about, and fix errors, comparing predicted and actual outcomes through process-level metrics. The benchmark consists of 4,201 READMEs from 323 repositories, stratified by the number of injected errors per README, with a distribution favoring levels 1 and 2.\n",
      "4 Experiments: We evaluated advanced LLMs and agent frameworks, including GPT-4.1, Claude-4, Gemini2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-V3-0324 for foundation models and agent frameworks. Evaluation settings included zero-shot, code agents, and environment setup agents. The study found that zero-shot LLMs exhibit high recall but low precision in error typing, while code agents significantly improve this with OpenHands + DeepSeek-V3, but action/feedback abilities are underdeveloped. Environment configuration agents deliver the largest end-to-end gains, demonstrating effective perception and feedback utilization. Persistent gaps between description and fix accuracy and fix accuracy to Pass@1 reveal bottlenecks in feedback translation to execution action, necessitating process-level agent planning optimization and enhanced feedback utilization.\n",
      "5 Conclusion: The agent's environment configuration remains a major obstacle. A new benchmark focuses on process-level evaluation, generating scalable task instances through realistic error injection and Docker validation. While the agent demonstrates capability in error perception, it struggles with specific repair actions, likely due to a lack of effective interaction and feedback. Future research should enhance its ability to interact with the environment.\n",

      "Introduction: Deep learning methods have significantly improved UAV obstacle avoidance and path planning, enabling more efficient navigation in complex environments. Reinforcement learning, particularly with DRL, is now being used to automate decision-making processes, allowing UAVs to learn through trial and error. Deep reinforcement learning is particularly effective in dynamic environments featuring small variations, while deep learning excels in handling complex visual data like images and LiDAR.  Hybrid approaches combining deep learning with traditional path planning techniques are also being explored to address challenges like rapid changes in the environment.\n",
      "Results: Results show that the LSTM baseline exhibits exploration plateau after 300 iterations, saturating at a norm of 0.94 ± 0.5. Replacing the recurrent core with an attention mechanism increases the plateau to 0.98 ± 0.2, reaching a top of 1.0 ± 0.1 after 600 iterations. The curves are generated from a moving average of 200 episodes. The task-level safety of the models increased with LSTM to flow-aware GTrXL, with peak success probabilities increasing from 1.0 to 0 collisions during inference. Crash rates decreased from PPO+LSTM to flow-aware GTrXL. DRL policies are trained in closed-loop settings and are explicitly optimized to generalize across a wide distribution of initial conditions and flow realizations.\n",
      "Discussion: The Transformer-based architectures, particularly GTrXL, demonstrate superior learning efficiency and reward compared to the LSTM baseline due to their gated self-attention mechanisms and explicit memory access, enabling better handling of long-range dependencies and dynamic flow fields. The Flow-aware GTrXL further enhances this by incorporating a multi-objective learning framework and a contrastive loss, resulting in improved robustness and adaptability in turbulent environments.\n",

      "1. Introduction: Here’s a summary of the paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "A study investigates the degradation of visual-language representations during supervised fine-tuning of VLMs, specifically focusing on the loss of semantic grounding and generalization ability. Initial research showed that adapting VLMs to action tasks often leads to overfitting and representation collapse. This work addresses this by starting with a pretrained VLA and fine-tuning it with limited data, demonstrating systematic degradation during task-specific fine-tuning. The authors introduce a lightweight Visual Representation Alignment method inspired by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis to mitigate this degradation. Experiments show that this method consistently improves out-of-distribution generalization, achieving up to a 10% relative gain over naive SFT. The paper also proposes a diagnostic task suite, VL-Think, to assess transfer of VL knowledge.\n",
      "2. Related Works: Large-scale multimodal learning aims to unify perception, reasoning, and control through scaling VL pretraining. Recent studies show increasing alignment of representations across architectures and modalities as models grow, with methods like REPA, OLA-VLM, 3DRS, and Geometry Forcing demonstrating this trend. The challenge remains preserving VL understanding during fine-tuning.\n",
      "3. Preliminaries: The VLA model uses a multimodal Transformer backbone with L stacked layers. Input sequences (visual and textual) are processed through a shared embedding space. Each layer updates hidden states using self-attention, and the model uses an autoregressive objective to generate target tokens. During decoding, the model conditions on the input and previously generated tokens, using a causal mask to ensure dependencies are only based on the input sequence. Training involves a next-token loss.\n",
      "4. VL-Think Task Suite: The VL-Think Task Suite evaluates VL capabilities independently of low-level control, focusing on assessing transfer of knowledge from VLMs to VLAs. It uses a Simpler benchmark with a carrot object on abstract boards, evaluating both VLA and VLM models through eight tasks that test semantic grounding and object placement. The suite isolates VL skills by limiting execution complexity, measuring whether a model correctly understands visual symbols and compositional cues.\n",
      "5. VL representations analysis: The VL representations in Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate strong semantic grounding and precise object-focused attention, while OpenVLA exhibits significant degradation in attention quality and domain forgetting, suggesting a loss of semantic understanding.  T-SNE visualization reveals a structured latent space for instruction-related tokens, while attention maps demonstrate the model’s focus on relevant objects, supporting the hypothesis of domain-specific knowledge erosion.\n",
      "6. Method: The paper introduces a Visual Representation Alignment objective to stabilize VLA model representations by aligning them with a frozen teacher encoder. This mitigates drift by encouraging the model to maintain consistent semantic structure across tasks and environments. The method utilizes a lightweight projector to measure similarity between student and teacher embeddings, and a loss function that integrates autoregressive action and alignment to preserve perceptual consistency.\n",
      "7. Experiments: We evaluate our proposed alignment method in several robotics environments using Simpler, Tao, and Liu robotics environments, assessing robustness to vision, semantics, and execution variations across three axes. OOD evaluation includes 128 randomized variations, quantified with linear probing on ImageNet-100. Model performance is assessed over 128 randomized seeds with SD reporting and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for p-value reporting. The Freeze baseline fails across all categories, indicating that freezing pretrained visual features does not preserve useful representations during adaptation. Joint optimization is necessary to recover general-purpose visual semantics while adapting to new robotic environments.\n",
      "8. Ablations: A systematic ablation study was conducted to analyze the impact of different design choices on visual alignment of visual representations, focusing on the choice of teacher model, alignment strategy, target layers, projector type, and loss functions. C-RADIOv3 achieved the best overall results, indicating that stronger vision models trained on large, diverse, and multimodal data offer more stable and generalizable visual features for alignment. Backbone2Enc consistently yielded stronger results, suggesting that the primary degradation occurs in the middle-to-late fusion layers of the VLA model, requiring regularization to maintain visual-semantic consistency. Experiments revealed that freezing the MLP projector is crucial for maintaining visual-semantic consistency, while aligning middle layers yields the most substantial improvements across generalization.\n",
      "9. Conclusion: The study investigated the degradation of VL understanding and representation quality resulting from fine-tuning VLA models on robotic tasks. It introduced a diagnostic suite and interpretability probes to analyze this degradation, proposing a lightweight Visual Alignment method to improve OOD generalization across diverse scenarios. The research focused on fine-tuning rather than full pretraining, aiming to guide future efforts in scalable robotic pretraining and VL knowledge transfer.\n",

The study tests the hypothesis that model variant B outperforms baseline model A in success rate, utilizing paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests across different environments.  A linear probe was used to assess the impact of the alignment objective on internal representations, and the study employs a frozen-feature linear probe to ensure reproducibility.\n",

      "1 Introduction: Here’s a summary of the provided text:\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper investigates unlearning robustness in large language models (LLMs) by examining how knowledge entanglement and persuasive framing interact. Recent work shows that even state-of-the-art models struggle with factual knowledge, necessitating a new approach. The authors propose the Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB) to analyze this interaction. SKeB integrates cognitive theory with communication principles to evaluate how knowledge structure and prompt delivery influence unlearning. The framework introduces nine entanglement metrics and demonstrates that distance-weighted influence (ℳ 9 \\mathcal{M}_{9}) strongly predicts factual recall, with authority framing significantly increasing entanglement activation. Furthermore, the study reveals that smaller models exhibit greater factual recall increases compared to larger models, offering a predictive model for knowledge leakage.\n",
      "2 Motivation: The paper investigates LLM knowledge retrieval through semantic entanglement and communicative framing. Adversarial prompts reactivate knowledge, demonstrating suppression rather than erasure. Hebb’s principle suggests knowledge entanglement, allowing for indirect reactivation of forgotten information. The paper hypothesizes that different delivery methods, such as persuasive framing, exploit this entanglement to reveal residual knowledge and influence model behavior. The Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB) formalizes this process, evaluating knowledge retrieval through semantic entanglement and communicative framing.\n",
      "3 Problem Formulation: We formalize the SKeB framework through three components: stimulus, entanglement, and behavior. The stimulus activates domain graph regions, entanglement determines spread, and behavior reflects knowledge access. Unlearning aims to suppress knowledge via rhetorical framing, evaluating model outputs across factual recall, non-factual content, and hallucination dimensions. The study utilizes a domain graph to quantify entanglement and employs ensemble judge models for factuality assessment, aiming to predict unlearning failures and assess model robustness.\n",
      "4 Experiment Setup: The experiment setup involves using the Harry Potter domain (χℜ) as a dataset for unlearning LLM variants, processing 1,200 prompts through three models (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-2-13B) with the same approximate unlearning algorithm.  The response evaluation employed an ensemble of three judge models (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-5-nano) assessing factual recall, non-factualness, and hallucination, with gpt-5-mini resolving borderline cases. A co-occurrence domain graph was constructed from seven Harry Potter books, resulting in 1,296 entities and 35,922 edges, with nine entanglement metrics quantifying structural properties.\n",
      "5 Results: Here’s a summary of the provided text:\n",
      "\n",
      "The research investigates the effects of framing, emotionality, and architectural differences on unlearning models. Results show that persuasive framing systematically alters entanglement patterns, with authority prompts enhancing distance-weighted influence and suppressing hallucinations. Emotional framing suppresses hallucination, while logical framing enhances factual recall. The model size inversely correlates with persuasive technique effectiveness, and the ℳ 9 \\mathcal{M}_{9} metric is the strongest predictor of factual recall. The study also reveals correlations between architectural differences and unlearning robustness, with LLaMA-2-7B exhibiting genuine knowledge disruption and LLaMA-3.1-8B retaining intact knowledge structures.\n",
      "6 Discussion: Authority prompts, persuasion, and the size-vulnerability paradox are key factors influencing LLM factual recall. The unlearning method reveals a persistent knowledge base, while entanglement increases hallucination risk.\n",
      "7 Related Works: Sun et al. (2023) demonstrated that LLM factuality degrades systematically, with performance declining as entity popularity decreases. Their Head-to-Tail benchmark showed that model size doesn't automatically improve factual knowledge retention. The study investigates unlearning effectiveness, reveals that it removes or suppresses knowledge, demonstrates that persuasive framing recovers more content, and analyzes entanglement metrics. These findings suggest static factuality assessments underestimate knowledge retention in both base and unlearned models. Existing research often frames unlearning as an adversarial attack, but this investigation explores how rhetorical framing impacts unlearning robustness, particularly when presented to LLMs in different contexts. The SKeB framework, modeling memory retrieval as activation propagating through semantic networks, offers a systematic approach to understanding unlearning behaviors and aligns with existing literature demonstrating GPT-3's cognitive patterns and human-like priming effects.\n",
      "8 Conclusions: Our work proposes a SKeB system for proactive vulnerability assessment before LLM deployment, demonstrating that entanglement metrics strongly predict factual recall and persuasive framing recovers 50-128% more content with inverse model size. A regression model explains 78% of variance, enabling accurate prediction, and different architectures reveal distinct correlations in knowledge encoding and suppression.  LLMs are more vulnerable to authority appeals than emotional appeals.\n",
      "Limitations: This work establishes connections between cognitive theories and machine unlearning, but faces limitations in generalization to sensitive domains and model size. Correlation analysis reveals potential reverse relationships, and while strong correlations validate the framework, direct neural activation observation is unavailable. The evaluation relies on specific LLM judges, and while results are indicative, full mechanistic understanding remains challenging. The framework offers predictive tools for vulnerability assessment, even with incomplete mechanistic insights.\n",
      "Social Impacts and Ethical Considerations: Findings suggest privacy protection is limited, potentially hindering unlearning effectiveness. Models can still provide harmful information, especially with framing, and unlearning alone is insufficient.  The framework offers evaluation tools, but models should not assume safety.  Scaling may lead to increased vulnerability, requiring architectural innovations.\n",

      "Appendix A Implementation Details: We obtained four models for evaluation: LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, OPT-2.7B, and leverages gradient ascent to unlearn Harry Potter content from Eldan and Russinovich (2023). For LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B, and OPT-2.7B, we implemented fine-tuning on the full Harry Potter corpus, creating forget and retain datasets, and applying the WHP unlearning algorithm. Hardware-wise, we used 4 GPUs with 128 GB GPU memory. Step 1 took approximately 3-7 hours, and Steps 2-3 took an additional 3-5 hours. The target domain was the complete Harry Potter corpus. Training parameters included batch size of 1, learning rate of 1 x 10^-4, and training duration of 3 epochs. Starting with 300 manually crafted base prompts, we used a scripted pipeline leveraging gpt-4 (via the OpenAI API) to generate three persuasive variants using distinct rhetorical techniques derived from persuasion theory: Emotional Appeal (emotional language, personal stories), Logical Reasoning (logical arguments), and Authority Endorsement (respected figures, institutional backing). For prompting the 4 models, we used a standardized text-generation procedure and applied it to each unlearned model. Models were loaded on a CUDA-enabled GPU when available, with automatic fallback to CPU. Each prompt, both the original and the three gpt-generated persuasive variants, was formatted with custom instruction markers ( [INST] ... [/INST] ) to guide the model to complete the sentence accurately. Generation was performed using a sampling-based approach with a maximum of 300 new tokens per prompt. While temperature, top-p, and repetition penalty were left at their default values, outputs for each prompt and variant were saved incrementally to a JSON file. This inference setup was applied consistently across all models, unlearned and base, enabling direct comparison of outputs while maintaining stable execution and controlled resource usage.\n",

      "1 Introduction: This paper investigates the collaborative capabilities of LLM agents, particularly under conditions of information asymmetry, using the Einstein Puzzles task. Two agents solve spatial and relational constraints in a tabletop environment, leveraging fine-tuning and a verifier to assess collaborative behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that agents with both seeking and providing communication capabilities perform best, while mismatched communication leads to degradation. Environment-based verification, leveraging natural feedback, significantly improves agent performance, and human study reveals a preference for proactive information sharing.\n",
      "2 Related work: This work explores LLM agents operating under information asymmetry in collaborative roles, incorporating human studies to assess real-world human-AI interaction. A verification model is introduced to evaluate LLM responses during inference time, leveraging environmental feedback from simulated environments to achieve a compute-efficient verification method.\n",
      "3 Collaboration Under Information Asymmetry: The paper presents a collaborative puzzle game where two agents compete to place objects into designated bins on a table, utilizing a distributed constraint satisfaction problem. Agents share information about destination bins and must collaboratively solve a task, measured by the minimum moves to complete the configuration. The paper investigates four communication action spaces – Information Providing & Seeking, Information Seeking Only, Information Providing & Seeking, and No Information Exchange – and evaluates LLM models using supervised fine-tuning and diverse game configurations to assess their ability to communicate and reason effectively.\n",
      "4 Environment-based Verifier: The research introduces a lightweight, training-free environment-based verifier designed to support LLM agents in collaborative reasoning. It utilizes game rules and previous communication to evaluate generated actions, expanding a graph of constraints iteratively. This approach assesses alignment with current knowledge and avoids unnecessary trials, demonstrating effectiveness through testing with alternative verifier strategies.\n",
      "5 Experiments and Results: We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of language models in reasoning and communication under information asymmetry. Our experiments address four key research questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Collaboration under Varying Communicative Action Space: How do agents collaborate under information asymmetry when equipped with different communicative actions?\n",
      "2.  Effectiveness of Environment-Based Verification: To what extent can environment-based verification enhance the performance?\n",
      "3.  Collaboration under Mismatched Communicative Action Space: What happens when agents with mismatched communication capabilities are paired together?\n",
      "4.  Human Preferences Toward Different Communication Behaviors: While agents may perform well in self-play, do these behaviors align with human preferences in collaboration?\n",
      "\n",
      "To systematically investigate our research questions, we design a series of experiments to investigate specific aspects of collaboration:\n",
      "\n",
      "Exp1: Collaboration with Different Communicative Action Spaces: We evaluated both closed-source language models via API calls and open-source models with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We deploy the same model (with the same action space) to perform self-play in the game. This setting allows direct comparison of collaboration with different communicative action space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exp2: Environment-Based Verifier: We augment the base models with an environment-based verifier, which provides binary feedback indicating whether each sampled action is valid. At each decision step, we sample 4 candidate responses using temperature=0.2 and top-p=0.9 , and apply the verifier to filter out invalid actions, selecting the first valid one as the final output. This setup enables a direct comparison of model performance with and without the verifier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exp3: Collaboration with Mismatched Communicative Action Space: We select the well-performing models from those action spaces (Llama3.1-8B without CoT for no information exchange , and Llama3.1-8B with CoT for the rest), equipped with reasoning verifier, and let them play with each other. This setting further reveals the behaviors of collaboration between agents with different communication capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exp4: Human Performance: Once we identified the most effective configuration of communicative action space for collaborative reasoning among LLM agents, we further examined whether these behaviors align with human preferences in collaboration. We recruited 12 college students as human participants to interact with the best-performing models, each equipped with different communicative action spaces and supported by the reasoning verifier. We sampled 27 unseen games (9 games each with 4, 5, and 6 objects) and measured both task completion rate and efficiency. Each participant was assigned a sequence of 9 games—3 games each with 4, 5, and 6 objects—while being given the complete communicative action space. In each game, they interacted with a model configured with a specific communicative action space, which remained unknown to the participant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation Metrics: We employ complementary metrics to assess both effectiveness and efficiency. For effectiveness, we report the Success Rate (SR) and subgoal success rate (Sub.R) at the first attempt (Pass@1). SR measures the percentage of games successfully completed within a limited number of steps (30 for all the experiments), while Sub.R reflects partial progress by capturing the proportion of objects correctly placed, even when the full game is not successfully completed. For efficiency, we track the number of steps taken to complete each game and compare it to the optimal solution calculated by our planner. We compute the Step Ratio (StepR), defined as the ratio of the number of executed steps to the number of steps in the optimal solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a verifier is applied, we additionally report the correction rate ( Corr.R ), indicating the proportion of responses corrected by the verifier. We report standard error for each metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across all model families, we observe a generally clear hierarchy in task performance: Information Seeking & Providing > Seeking Only > Mismatched Action Spaces > No Information Exchange > Providing Only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enabling both seeking and providing actions consistently yields the highest Success Rate (SR ) and lower Step Ratio ( StepR ). confirming that bi-directional exchange is both expressive and effective for coordinating constraints, especially when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Permitting only information seeking is better than permitting only information providing. Targeted queries minimize redundant traffic and let agents actively access the missing piece of information, whereas blind sharing often floods the channel with constraints that are irrelevant or already known by their partners. Therefore, the result suggests that information seeking is a more task-efficient option than unprompted information providing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, disabling communication altogether ( “No Information Exchange” ) ranks high for some variants. Without communication and reasoning process through CoT, the task reduces to pure object manipulation and random guessing;\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the model’s entire capacity is devoted to mastering game rules and action affordance. Llama variants exploit this by memorizing high-probability transition patterns, achieving a success rate greater than 81%. Qwen, which is pre-trained on a different instruction distribution, does not show the same effect, suggesting the phenomenon is model-specific rather than an intrinsic property of the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As shown in Table 1 , adding the reasoning verifier (our best verifier) to the base models leads to large absolute SR gains (labeled in red), ranging from 10 to 40% increment. This reflects the high potential capabilities of the base models, as well as the effectiveness of the assistance from our verifier.\n",
      "\n",
      "To better understand the underlying behaviors, we further examine model behavior in scenarios where two agents are assigned different communicative action spaces. Specifically, we evaluate four asymmetric pairings of action spaces, as shown in Table 3 . We exclude the pair Provide only vs. None, as it is functionally equivalent to Provide & Seek vs. None . In both cases, one agent is unable to respond to queries. Similarly, Seek only vs. None is the same as None vs. None , since the None agent cannot initiate or respond to communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the evaluated pairings, we observe a consistent drop in performance when agents have mismatched communicative abilities. This finding highlights the importance of aligning communication protocols in collaborative tasks and provides insights into designing matched-communication agent design.\n",
      "6 Conclusion: We found that aligned communication, particularly information seeking and providing, is crucial for successful collaboration in a tabletop setting with LLM agents. Error analysis reveals limitations in task understanding, which are addressed through environment-based verification. Human study emphasizes the importance of proactive and transparent communication for trust and interpretability. These findings highlight a need for reliable, communication-aware, and interpretable design for future LLM-based collaborative systems.\n",
      "Limitations: The study has limitations due to reliance on a simulated environment with recoverable invalid actions, which remains challenging to extend to real-world settings. Human evaluation was conducted on a small scale, limiting the ability to compare models and expand the study with more participants and broader comparisons.\n",

      "Appendix A Example of Game Play: Figure 3 illustrates a complete game session of the Einstein Puzzle, building on the initial setup in Figure 1. This example demonstrates turn-taking, decision-making, and communication, serving as a reference for understanding the game’s mechanics and reasoning process. The ask action is not utilized in this simplified case.\n",
      "Appendix B Data Generation: The planner generates solutions under different action spaces, utilizing breadth-first search and an evolving knowledge state incorporating communication history and object positions. It avoids redundant information seeking through inference and identifies unknown goals by asking for information. It introduces pass actions to skip turns and handles scenarios with no communication, allowing for random guessing. The planner collects both optimal and near-optimal trajectories to represent diverse communication strategies, including strategies where agents attempt multiple bin locations, mirroring models observed in Table 1.\n",
      "Appendix C Ablation on Environment-Based Verifiers: The study introduces three verifier types: affordance, which validates physical actions based on environment rules, and communication, which assesses meaningful communication. The reasoning verifier builds upon these, extending coverage through inferred knowledge. The affordance and communication verifiers are hierarchically linked, with the reasoning verifier providing a flexible framework adaptable to various environments. Performance comparisons across different settings, including Llama3.1-8B CoT, demonstrate the verifier’s potential as a general and lightweight approach to simulated environments.\n",
      "Appendix D Experiment Details: The study utilized Azure OpenAI models for GPT-4o-20241120, employing LoRA fine-tuning with a rank of 32, 128 batch size, and 2e-4 learning rate, accelerated by FlashAttention-2. Model evaluation involved PeFT, vLLM, and human subjects in four action space configurations, with a maximum step limit of 30 minutes, and a consent form.\n",
      "Appendix E Error Taxonomy: The appendix defines four error types: format following (invalid output, token limit), physical understanding (incorrect source location), destination bin unreachable, and source and destination bin being the same.  Communication includes redundant knowledge sharing, missing share after seek, and wrong share after seek. Task reasoning includes incorrect rule understanding and wrong random guessing.\n",
      "Appendix F Code of Ethics: The research study involves interacting with AI agents to complete tasks, including a logical board game and sharing information. The study lasts approximately one hour and will record text, symbolic inputs, and numerical evaluations. Data will be analyzed for research purposes and will not store personally identifiable information.\n",
      "Appendix G Human Study Interface: The study introduces a web-based logic-based tabletop game where two players collaborate with an AI agent. Players must place objects into designated bins according to a set of constraints, including relationships between objects and bin placement rules. The game utilizes four actions: Move, Share, Ask, and Skip. The AI agent’s objective is to complete the task with the fewest steps through collaboration and guidance. The game board features a game area, objects within reach, constraints, and objects to ask about. The game ends when objects are placed correctly or after 30 turns. A short survey is required after each game to assess the experience.\n",
      "Appendix H Prompts Used: The study presents four action space configurations, each with and without chain-of-thought reasoning, utilizing prompts tailored to each. GPT-4o generates reasoning traces and actions in a specific format for the Providing &℟ Seeking configuration, while the remaining configurations differ in permitted action spaces and reasoning examples. The study employs a planner to generate solutions for each game instance, prompting GPT-4o to assume the agent's perspective and rationale. GPT-4o’s reasoning traces are used as supervision for smaller models, with additional guidance provided for a fairer comparison.\n",

      "1 Introduction: This paper introduces the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful names for unnamed predicates in logic programming. It reviews existing literature, presents a methodology, details experimental setup, presents results, discusses limitations, and concludes with future research directions.\n",
      "2 Preliminaries: 2.1: The paper introduces the invention of predicates – symbolic representations – within ILP systems.  Invented predicates, denoted as \"inv,\" are used to simplify rules, enhance modularity, and represent new concepts. The PI technique automates the discovery of these predicates, addressing a challenge in automatically generating new symbolic representations. The paper explores various approaches, including the use of \"inv\" in the example of parent-grandparent relations, and highlights the ongoing effort to improve the process through metarules and the Learning From Failures framework. The authors also discuss the application of hierarchical probabilistic logic programming (HPLPs) and the creation of new predicates through PHIL, a learning algorithm, and the use of abductive logic programming (ALP) to derive new relations. The paper also considers the use of the \"collaboretedOn\" predicate, and the application of matrix operations to discover new relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2: Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasize prompt engineering – crafting clear instructions for models to guide output. Key elements include goals, context, audience, role, input data, output format, and examples. The order of information influences response quality, utilizing the primacy effect and recency effect. Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought prompting improve performance through careful prompt design.\n",
      "3 Related work: This work explores methods to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs, leveraging recent advancements in neural networks and symbolic reasoning. NeSyGPT integrates neural and symbolic components to improve logical reasoning, while LLM2LAS utilizes LLMs for ASP program generation from natural language. These efforts address challenges in predicate naming and logical inference, demonstrating potential for automated knowledge representation and reasoning within the ILP domain.\n",
      "4 Renaming predicates using LLMs: This section outlines a method for assigning meaningful names to unnamed predicates using Large Language Models (LLMs). The pipeline involves prompting the LLMs to generate suggestions, evaluating their relevance, and selecting the best name. The study utilizes seven LLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-o3mini, Gemini, and Command R+, and evaluates their performance through automated judging and human evaluation.\n",
      "5 Experiments and Results: Here’s a concise summary of the paper sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **5.1 Prompting Strategy:** Models varied in their approaches to initial instructions, utilizing independent runs and ChatGPT’s memory feature to prevent persistent interactions. Models struggled with name extraction, requiring multiple attempts and a naming constraint.\n",
      "- **5.2 Results for Few-Shot Prompting:** FalconMamba, Llama, and Falcon3 demonstrated varying performance, with Falcon3 correctly identifying 10 out of 16 names, while Llama failed to generate meaningful output. FalconMamba’s performance suggests a need for prompt engineering.\n",
      "- **5.3 LLMs Judgment Results:**  ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o3mini were the best-performing models, with Gemini and Command R+ performing poorly. Few-shot prompting improved FalconMamba, while Falcon3 provided correct suggestions.\n",
      "- **5.4 Human Judgment Results:** Human judges favored straightforward names, aligning with LLM behavior, and correctly identified predicates h0 and h3.\n",
      "- **5.5 Summary of Results:** ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o3mini were the best-performing models, followed by Gemini and Command R+. Llama, FalconMamba, and Falcon3 performed poorly.\n",
      "6 Discussion: The discussion highlights limitations of automated predicate naming for logic theory rules, particularly with LLMs. Current approaches rely on placeholder names, while the authors suggest using predefined names and prompting models to suggest them, but face challenges with model failures, rule alteration, and difficulty with real-world data.  The approach is hampered by simple examples, model errors, and the need for manual standardization of names, hindering its effectiveness.  Further research suggests domain-specific fine-tuning may be necessary for practical applications.\n",
      "7 Conclusion: The paper proposes a pipeline using LLMs to suggest predicates in logic theories, addressing the issue of interpretability. While the initial results are promising, the study is limited by example selection and future research could explore more complex scenarios, investigate language-specific conventions, and utilize fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific naming, as well as quantized models for local deployment.\n",

      "MTIR-SQL is a reinforcement learning framework for multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning in text-to-SQL, enhancing LLMs’ reasoning through trajectory filtering and KL regularization, resulting in improved SQL execution accuracy. Experiments on the BIRD dataset demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving a 16% absolute improvement over baselines. The methodology utilizes π θ ( ⋅ | x ; ℰ ) \\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|x;\\mathcal{E}) leveraging real-time execution results to guide the model’s reasoning. GRPO-Filter, an enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) variant, incorporates three innovations: constrained optimization, selective rollout filtering, and multi-turn extension. Performance on main benchmarks is significantly higher than other models, with MTIR-SQL achieving 64.4% accuracy on the BIRD Dev set and 57.17% on the 10B-30B range. Ablation studies reveal that different reward components impact model performance, with the GRPO-Filter stabilizing training while sacrificing reward collapse. The paper concludes that a balanced reward system is essential for optimal performance. MTIR-SQL outperforms baseline methods and achieves 64.4% accuracy on BIRD-SQL and 84.6% execution accuracy on SPIDER with a 4B-parameter model.\n",
      "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback, which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves 64.4% accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev, significantly outperforming existing approaches.\n",
      "KVDA-UCT demonstrates superior performance in deterministic settings, outperforming OGA-UCT and other methods, particularly in environments like SysAdmin and Wildfire. It detects more abstractions than OGA-UCT, and outperforms all competitors in some environments, including those with multiple iterations.\n",
      "A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency, which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework, which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.\n",

      "**Expanding on the Exponential Map & Group Structure**\n",
      "\n",
      "The exponential map, `exp(θ)`, is the linchpin of the derivation. It’s not simply a mapping; it’s a carefully constructed transformation that reveals the group’s underlying structure.  Let’s delve deeper into its role:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The Exponential Map as a Transformation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The exponential map, `exp(θ)`, transforms the evolution of the vector field `v` into a transformation of the variables `x` and `u`.  The key is that `θ` is a parameter that controls the *type* of transformation being applied.  Different parameters lead to different types of transformations – rotations, reflections, scaling, etc.  The map essentially “unfolds” the PDE’s evolution into a set of differential equations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.  The Transformation Equations – A Core Concept:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The equations derived from the ansatz are the heart of the derivation.  They are *not* simple differential equations. Instead, they are *transformation equations*.  These equations are crucial because they explicitly define how the variables `x` and `u` change as they move through the group.  The transformation equations are typically expressed in a form that allows for a direct computation of the generated vector field.

They are *not* just a simple mapping; they are carefully designed to preserve the essential properties of the system.  The transformation maps are the key to understanding how the group’s structure translates into the differential equations.  The transformation maps are often expressed as a set of equations that relate the initial state to the final state.\n",

      "The transformation maps are directly linked to the group’s elements. The group’s structure dictates the *type* of transformation that is applied. For example, a rotational symmetry might manifest as a specific transformation map that preserves the vector field’s orientation. The transformation maps are the mathematical representation of the group’s structure.\n",

      "We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations, the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model’s accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models, facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions, showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.\n",

      "The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations, primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on conversational datasets involving psychiatrist–patient interactions focused on mental health conditions (e.g., depression). These models are capable of identifying mental disorders with high accuracy based on natural language input. The diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate seamless communication between the LLM consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Each LLM in the consortium was fine-tuned using the Unsloth library on Google Colab’s Tesla GPUs. To optimize performance on consumer-grade hardware, we employed Low-Rank Adaptation with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA). Experimental results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis—paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.\n",

      "This paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) architecture, the PQC, designed to improve gradient stability and expressiveness. The PQC utilizes a quantum state representing recurrent core memory, allowing for exponential memory capacity and enhanced gradient preservation. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance with LSTM and scaled Cayley orthogonal scoRNNs, with the PQC proving computationally stable and retaining more stable gradients. The authors introduce a new hybrid QRNN architecture, balancing expressivity, implementation simplicity, and simulation efficiency, incorporating a feedforward network and leveraging the PQC for quantum state manipulation.  The paper also discusses the challenges of hybrid quantum-classical systems and proposes improvements in toolchains and hardware to enable more accurate simulations.\n",
      "We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden state is the quantum state of an nn-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially large Hilbert space ℂ2n\\mathbb{C}^{2^{n}}. The PQC is unitary by construction, making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints. At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise) grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.\n",

      "The paper investigates unlearning robustness in large language models (LLMs) by examining the interplay of knowledge entanglement and persuasive framing. It proposes the Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB) to analyze this interaction, integrating cognitive theory with communication principles. The SKeB introduces nine entanglement metrics and demonstrates that distance-weighted influence (ℳ 9 \\mathcal{M}_{9}) strongly predicts factual recall, with authority framing significantly increasing entanglement activation. Smaller models exhibit greater factual recall increases compared to larger models, suggesting a predictive model for knowledge leakage. The study utilizes a domain graph to quantify entanglement and employs ensemble judge models for factuality assessment, aiming to predict unlearning failures and assess model robustness.\n",
      "Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to 13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs. Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and overall behavior in LLMs.\n",

      "The paper investigates collaborative puzzle solving with LLMs, focusing on the effectiveness of communication strategies. It demonstrates that agents with seeking and providing communication capabilities perform best, while mismatched communication degrades performance. The research introduces a lightweight verifier to improve LLM responses, and human studies reveal a preference for proactive information sharing. Experiments evaluate different communication action spaces, including seeking, providing, and mismatched communication, and assess model performance with and without a verifier. The study also examines how human preferences for communication styles influence model behavior, particularly in collaborative tasks.

To address this limitation, this paper studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game.\n",

      "Empirical results highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an environment-based verifier, we enhance agents’ ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles\n"
