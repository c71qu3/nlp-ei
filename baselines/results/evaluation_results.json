Here's a summary:\n\n1. **Safety-critical evaluation**: MPA is tested on 10 scenes with non-native agents to challenge the ego agents in an adversarial way. The simulation frequency is 4 Hz, and the termination conditions include full route completion, off-road events, collision events, too far from the reference trajectory, and maximum rollout time limits.\n\n2. **Baselines**: MPA is compared with diverse baselines in E2E driving algorithms, including pretrained base policies with open-loop training (UniAD, VAD, and LTF) and E2E agents trained with curated counterfactual datasets (AD-MLP).\n\n3. **Constrained rollout with pretrained E2E agents**: MPA uses pretrained UniAD, VAD, and LTF as base behavior policies to generate counterfactual datasets. The key parameter is to filter out undesired samples based on reward heuristics.\n\n4. **Policy adapter**: MPA excludes collision samples with a reward of -1, but retains them in the training dataset of the Q-value network. The policy adapter ensures reliable learning for both the value network and the policy adapter.\n\n5. **Experimental results**: MPA demonstrates effectiveness in boosting safety and generalizability on nuScenes data and HUGSIM benchmark.\n\n6. **Future work**: The current approach assumes reliable rendering from 3DGS under constrained trajectory deviations and decouples value modeling from policy optimization.

      "summary": "This text describes an algorithm that integrates a safety shield with Q-function updates in a reinforcement learning context.\n\nHere's a summary of the key points:\n\n1.  **Algorithm Core:** The algorithm updates a Q-function using a model, taking into account how a \"safety shield\" will act. It corrects potentially unsafe actions proposed by the model with actions guaranteed to be safe. An epsilon-greedy policy is used for action selection, with the safety shield ensuring the chosen action is always safe within an MDP environment.\n\n2.  **Comparison to Baselines:**\n    *   **Dyna-Q (No Safety):** A standard Dyna-Q agent, without safety measures, learns an optimal path but fails and collides when new obstacles appear in the test environment.\n    *   **Baseline Safety Shield (Stop Action):** A baseline safety shield (Alshiekh et al., 2018) replaces any risky action with a \"stop\" action, prioritizing maximum safety. While safe, this approach often leads the agent to get stuck and fail to reach the goal.\n\n3.  **Proposed Algorithm's Advantage (Prediction):**\n    *   The proposed algorithm incorporates *predictions* (with configurable prediction horizons, e.g., N=0 or N=1) into its decision-making process.\n    *   **Dynamic Obstacles:** It successfully adapts to new obstacles, avoiding collisions where the unsafeguarded Dyna-Q would fail.\n    *   **Dynamic Environments (e.g., Gate):** In a scenario with a dynamic gate, a predictive horizon (N=1) allows the agent to detect when the gate opens. It dynamically adjusts its path, reverting to a previously optimal route through the gate, reaching the goal four steps earlier than a simply retrained agent. This demonstrates its real-time adaptability to environmental changes.\n\n4.  **Trade-offs and Conclusion:**\n    *   While the epsilon-greedy policy might cause slight deviations from the absolute optimal path, the algorithm's main strength is its real-time adaptability to environmental changes.\n    *   Longer prediction horizons generally lead to more optimal paths but increase the computational cost per step.\n    *   The baseline safety shield, which only stops, gets stuck indefinitely in many scenarios.\n    *   The algorithm is more robust to changes in dynamic environments (like the timing of a gate opening) compared to baselines.\n\nIn essence, the proposed safety shield allows agents to dynamically adapt to environmental changes on the fly by incorporating predictions, leading to safer and more efficient path planning than non-safe or overly cautious baseline methods, albeit with a trade-off between prediction horizon length and computational cost.",

It introduces the **Information Scrambling Index (ISI)** as a key metric, finding it strongly associated with the final NC geometry.\n\nThe authors identify a consistent **three-phase \"Cliff-Plateau-Climb\" pattern** characterizing how ViT representations evolve with depth. A crucial finding during the \"Climb\" phase is the emergence of Neural Collapse and the systematic **marginalization** of the [CLS] token (its centrality decreases). This marginalization is correlated with better performance and a more favorable NC geometry, suggesting that trained models effectively bypass the [CLS] token as an information bottleneck, favoring a distributed patch-token consensus.\n\nMechanistically, **ViT-B** maintains a **controlled scrambling** regime (ISI roughly 0.004 to 0.009), which leads to more complete [CLS] marginalization and superior final NC geometry. In contrast, **ViT-L** enters a regime of **excessive scrambling** or \"chaotic diffusion\" (ISI up to approximately 0.031). This over-communication requires ViT-L to use significantly more layers (e.g., almost twice as many blocks for marginalization) to achieve comparable or worse information-task tradeoffs, resulting in degraded NC geometry despite greater computational cost.

Chinchilla model training efficiency gains are substantial but remain below 10x for much of the contemporary machine learning scale (10^16 - 10^24 FLOPs).\n\nThe study compares LSTMs with various Transformer architectures (Modern, Retro, and Kaplan Transformers). A key finding is that neural network architecture improvements, particularly the LSTM-to-Transformer shift, are not scale-invariant and exhibit increasing returns to scale. At smaller scales, LSTMs are only about 6.28x less compute-efficient than Transformers, but this gap widens dramatically, leading to massive efficiency gains (up to 10,000x) for Transformers over LSTMs at frontier scales. This architectural shift accounts for 68% of measured frontier-scale efficiency gains, with Kaplan-to-Chinchilla rebalancing contributing most of the rest. Conversely, factors like optimizer choice (Adam vs. SGD) and minor Transformer variants (Modern vs. Retro) are found to be relatively scale-invariant.\n\nThe paper challenges traditional views of algorithmic progress, noting that while it's often seen as much faster than hardware progress (e.g., 22,000x vs. 32x over ten years), at smaller scales (e.g., 10^18 FLOPs), algorithmic gains can be less than hardware progress (around 20x).\n\nKey limitations include the fickle nature of hyperparameters (e.g., difficulty scaling SGD with batch sizes over 128) and reliance on literature-based estimates for some algorithmic improvements.

This quantity is often 0 in practice, simplifying the calculation. The logic extends to `Union_min(L)_x` and \"extras.\" Label quantities can be lower than bottom values due to concept combinations, and the reasoning for maximum intersection estimation is adapted by substituting `I^C` with `E^C`, `I^U` with `E^U`, and `N^C` with `SE^C`.\n\n2.  **Algorithm Completeness and IoU Guarantee:** The algorithm is **complete** and **guaranteed to find the combination of concepts** (`L_1 ⊕ ... ⊕ L_n`) that achieves the **highest possible alignment (IoU)**. This guarantee stems from three factors:\n    *   The heuristics used to explore the state space are **admissible** (Sections ˜ F.1, F.3).\n    *   The quantities used for pruning are **underestimations** of the real IoU (Sections ˜ F.2, F.4).\n    *   The algorithm exhaustively explores all nodes with an estimated alignment greater than the found solution.\n\n3.  **Proof of Admissibility:** The admissibility of the label quantities heuristic is proven by considering `Top` and `Bott` vectors (encoding maximum and minimum possible improvements). The proof involves analyzing heuristic estimations for the numerator and denominator in eq. ˜ 3, especially in an \"ideal case\" where concepts fully overlap on extras, are pairwise disjoint, and have the largest possible element overlap with neuron activation.\n\n4.  **Quantity Calculation for Operators (Overlap Case):**\n    *   For **OR and AND**, unique quantities are estimated using formulas similar to the disjoint case.\n    *   For **AND NOT**, the unique quantity equals that of the left side (Observation ˜ 1).\n    *   Common quantities are derived by combining definitions from Section ˜ 2.2 and Observation ˜ 1.\n    *   Since `L_→` is always an atomic concept (Assumption 2), its quantities are exact (detailed in Appendix ˜ E).\n    *   Degenerate cases have their dIoU manually set to 0.\n\n5.  **Computational Efficiency:** To mitigate the cost of per-sample computations (requiring `|D|` comparisons), a \"lighter aggregated computation\" is introduced, obtained by summing values per label (e.g., transforming a sum of minimums into a minimum of sums).",

Second, it trains a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to select the most effective collaboration topology (e.g., linear, star, feedback) among the chosen LLMs.\n\nEvaluated on code generation (MBPP) and mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH) benchmarks, BAMAS demonstrates superior performance.

Component analysis further highlights the importance of both its LLM provisioning and topology selection.\n\nCrucially, BAMAS's topology selection is adaptive:\n*   For mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH), it predominantly selects the Feedback topology (40.1% and 69.8% respectively), which benefits from iterative refinement.\n*   For code generation tasks (MBPP), it favors the Linear topology, aligning with progressive refinement.\n*   Under low budget constraints, BAMAS's policy is risk-averse, opting for simpler Linear and Star topologies to reduce complexity and avoid budget overruns.",

Attacks are performed digitally, with perturbations constrained by pixel amplitude (e.g., L_infinity <= 4/255) and optionally restricted to sparse patches for stealth.

It achieves this by operating directly on the **projected feature space** of VLA visual encoders and integrating **Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)** with three attention-guided strategies:\n1.  **Gradient-weighted updates:** Based on attention weights.\n2.  **Sparse Top-K masking:** To focus perturbations.\n3.  **Focused loss masking:** To guide feature divergence on selected patches.\n\n**Key Findings:**\nADVLA significantly accelerates attack generation, offering several orders of magnitude acceleration compared to prior methods (e.g., generating a patch in minutes/hours for existing methods vs. being efficient enough for real-time assessment).

      "summary": "The provided text discusses a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework that leverages multi-Agent Learning Model (LLM) systems to address the complex challenges of Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC). This framework empowers each Access Point (AP) with a cognitive architecture featuring reasoning, memory, and tool use, allowing agents to autonomously learn and navigate the trade-off between two coordination strategies: Co-TDMA (Time-Division Multiple Access) and Co-SR (Slotted Random Access).\n\nThe agents use natural language dialogue to dynamically switch between these strategies based on their learning experience and the underlying interference patterns of their network environment. The framework's primary contribution is a new paradigm for decentralized wireless control that transcends traditional fixed rules.\n\nThe text highlights two key aspects of this dynamic coordination:\n\n1. **Dynamic Switching of Coordination Strategies**: Agents learn to recognize interference patterns and adapt their strategy accordingly, switching between conservative Co-TDMA and aggressive Co-SR approaches.\n2. **Negotiation Protocol in Natural Language**: Agents use rich, contextual proposals to fine-tune their coordination within the chosen scheme.\n\nThe authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework through simulations using two distinct LLMs and a multi-agent dialogue workflow implemented using AutoGen. The results show that the agents can learn to navigate the trade-off between Co-TDMA and Co-SR, leading to improved performance and robustness.\n\nThe framework's components, including reasoning, memory, and tool use, are essential for achieving robust and intelligent coordination.
