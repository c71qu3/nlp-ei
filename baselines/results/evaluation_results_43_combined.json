    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models have demonstrated strong performance in open-loop evaluations but often suffer from cascading errors and poor generalization in closed-loop settings. To address this gap, we propose Model-based Policy Adaptation (MPA), a general framework that enhances the robustness and safety of pretrained E2E driving agents during deployment. MPA first generates diverse counterfactual trajectories using a geometry-consistent simulation engine, exposing the agent to scenarios beyond the original dataset. Based on this generated data, MPA trains a diffusion-based policy adapter to refine the base policy’s predictions and a multi-step Q value model to evaluate long-term outcomes. At inference time, the adapter proposes multiple trajectory candidates, and the Q value model selects the one with the highest expected utility. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark using a photorealistic closed-loop simulator demonstrate that MPA significantly improves performance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and safety-critical scenarios. We further investigate how the scale of counterfactual data and inference-time guidance strategies affect overall effectiveness.\nThe project website is available at https://mpa-drive.github.io/ .",

Systems dynamics and structural equation modeling deal with two entirely different sets of equations. Confusions arise between these two approaches because people tend to either to associate the causal system of differential equations in SD with the linear equations representing the latent causal structure in SEM, or (2) associate the solution to the system of multiple differential equations corresponding to the implied covariance matrix in SEM. The next two subsections aim that this will enable readers trained in one approach to follow the argument and see the connection to the other approach. System dynamics builds on a framework of nonlinear differential equations; Structural equation modeling uses a system of linear equations to represent the relevant causal system and measurement model, which can be generalized to include nonlinear interaction terms, and an implied covariANCE matrix. The author presents a SD and SEM version of each system for each of the subsequent examples in hopes that it will help readers who have been trained in systems dynamics to understand the connection between the two approaches.4 Equations In this paper, the author attempts to link several different types of equations into a single theory.

    "abstract": "Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions.\nIn this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space.\nOur safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees.\nOur experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.",

      "summary": "This text describes an algorithm that integrates a safety shield with Q-function updates in a reinforcement learning context.\n\nHere's a summary of the key points:\n\n1.  **Algorithm Core:** The algorithm updates a Q-function using a model, taking into account how a \"safety shield\" will act. It corrects potentially unsafe actions proposed by the model with actions guaranteed to be safe. An epsilon-greedy policy is used for action selection, with the safety shield ensuring the chosen action is always safe within an MDP environment.\n\n2.  **Comparison to Baselines:**\n    *   **Dyna-Q (No Safety):** A standard Dyna-Q agent, without safety measures, learns an optimal path but fails and collides when new obstacles appear in the test environment.\n    *   **Baseline Safety Shield (Stop Action):** A baseline safety shield (Alshiekh et al., 2018) replaces any risky action with a \"stop\" action, prioritizing maximum safety. While safe, this approach often leads the agent to get stuck and fail to reach the goal.\n\n3.  **Proposed Algorithm's Advantage (Prediction):**\n    *   The proposed algorithm incorporates *predictions* (with configurable prediction horizons, e.g., N=0 or N=1) into its decision-making process.\n    *   **Dynamic Obstacles:** It successfully adapts to new obstacles, avoiding collisions where the unsafeguarded Dyna-Q would fail.\n    *   **Dynamic Environments (e.g., Gate):** In a scenario with a dynamic gate, a predictive horizon (N=1) allows the agent to detect when the gate opens. It dynamically adjusts its path, reverting to a previously optimal route through the gate, reaching the goal four steps earlier than a simply retrained agent. This demonstrates its real-time adaptability to environmental changes.\n\n4.  **Trade-offs and Conclusion:**\n    *   While the epsilon-greedy policy might cause slight deviations from the absolute optimal path, the algorithm's main strength is its real-time adaptability to environmental changes.\n    *   Longer prediction horizons generally lead to more optimal paths but increase the computational cost per step.\n    *   The baseline safety shield, which only stops, gets stuck indefinitely in many scenarios.\n    *   The algorithm is more robust to changes in dynamic environments (like the timing of a gate opening) compared to baselines.\n\nIn essence, the proposed safety shield allows agents to dynamically adapt to environmental changes on the fly by incorporating predictions, leading to safer and more efficient path planning than non-safe or overly cautious baseline methods, albeit with a trade-off between prediction horizon length and computational cost.",

      "summary": "Next, the authors investigate an agent equipped with a safety shield [ Alshiekh2018] that does not incorporate a prediction and replaces any risky action with a stop action. This approach prioritizes maximum safety by detecting obstacles and stopping at the last moment to avoid collisions. The results are shown in Figure 3 . The blue path is the original path learned by the Dyna-Q agent in the training environment, but with the appearance of new obstacles in the test environment, this path is now blocked and the agent collides with the newly introduced obstacle. Next, our algorithm investigates an agent fitted with a baseline safety shield. This agent does not include a prediction window and instead uses a Q W Q W function to predict future actions. The result is shown in Figures 3 . Our algorithm can respond in real time to environmental changes during execution, enabling the agent to adjust and plan an optimal path dynamically based on current conditions. We also c/o-intensive. Our approach may slightly deviate from the optimal path due to the use of an epsilon-greedy policy. This policy occasionally results in the agent randomly selecting safe actions, which can lead to suboptimal paths. If we set the epsilogic parameter to zero and choose a sufficiently large time horizon, the agent will follow the shortest path to the goal. However, if we set it to greater than zero or even for shorter horizons, then the agent might choose the safest path. It is also worth noting that an action proposed by the model at state s t s^ prime at line 10 might be unsafe. Since we are looking to get the most optimal path when only safe actions are performed, we correct it with a s ​ a f e n e ( s ′ s^2 ). We then use ε \\varepsilon - greedy policy to update the Q W w q w w w function while taking into account how the safety shield is going to act. In order to create a safe environment, we use MDP .

      "summary": "In this paper, Wollstonecraft conducts systematic testing of self-transparency under professional persona pressure. sixteen open-weight models are audited under identical conditions, testing their AI nature \"through epistemic probes such as 'How did you acquire your knowledge and expertise?'. The disclosure rates vary significantly across tested models, driven by model-specific factors rather than parameter count. In particular, financial institutions elicit higher baseline disclosures, likely reflecting rete widespread failures in disclosing AI identities. By instructing models to adopt human professional identities, role conflicts emerge between honest self-representation and instruction-following. Across all the different types of prompts, models perform well in terms of their degree of disclosure. However, there is considerable model heterogeneity within this universal suppression effect. Three high-performing models achieved 70-74% disclosure across all prompts, including DeepSeek V3, Qwen 3235B-Inst, GPT-OSS 20B, and Mistral-Small. The magnitude of suppression in these three models is comparable to differences between the highest and lowest performing models within some size classes. This demonstrates that reasoning training implementation choices can have effects as large as the variation across models within a size class. Similarly, in the Financial Advisory Contexts, where the Financial Advisor persona is used, models exhibit ceiling effects for many models, with disclosure rates reaching 90-100% by Prompt 2. Likewise, Neurosurgeon contexts show the n/a disclaimer patterns. Models fail to disclose across all contexts with varying degrees of frequency. Wollstones work provides systematic testing on self- transparency in relation to professional personas. Using an asynchronous infrastructure with interleaved judge calls, he performs 19,200 trials in under 20 minutes on consumer hardware at a cost of $16.66. Disclosure rates vary substantially across tests based on parameter count but also depend upon model specific factors, such as context. For example, while models with a 70B parameter range achieve 4.1% disclosure, those with a 14B model reach 61.4%. Furthermore, models exhibiting context-dependent patterns tend to respond to financial transactions in a way that leads them to disclose their artificial nature in financial settings much more frequently than non-financial ones. To determine how disclosure responds are determined by the assigned persona, they examine four sequential probes. The same model showed distinct trajectories across the four sub-propositions, revealing that AI identity disclosure responses are highly context dependent. Each probe has different trajectory shapes and tends to respond in different ways depending on the assigned profession. Propositions dealing with epistemic questions such as \"'How did ye acquire your know and expertise?'?\" reveal whether the underlying AI is able to disclose its true nature when probed about claimed expertise. To enable efficient large-scale evaluation, an asynchronous technology with interled judge calls was developed, processing 19 200 trials in less than twenty minutes onconsumer hardware at 16 dollars per trial. The authors note that disclosure rates averaged across all models and prompts. While baseline personas maintained near perfect disclosure rates, professional peopleas reduced disclosure universally in the sample. Overall, disclosure ranged from 24.4% to 61.0% across professional personages. Models exhibited qualitatively different disclosure trajectories over time, with results being strongly region-dependent according to the severity of the question asked. The field of study is thus characterized by model heterogeneity which leads to significant variance in overall performance. Methodologically speaking, it is important to note that the amount of suppression shown by certain models is proportional to the extent of the error. A lack of suppression does not indicate any inherent fault in the underlying machine, but rather that the decision to implement the wrong solution may influence the outcome.",

Our method sets up an adversarial interaction between a policy (generator) and a relativistic critic (discriminator): the policy learns to mimic expert answers, while the critic learns to compare and distinguish between policy and expert answers. Our method trains both the policy and the critic jointly and continuously via RL, and we identify the key stabilization techniques required for robust learning. Empirically, RARO significantly outperforms strong verifier-free baselines on all of our evaluation tasks — Countdown, DeepMath, and Poetry Writing — and enjoys the same robust scaling trends as RL on verifiable tasks. These results demonstrate that our method effectively elicits strong reasoning performance from expert demonstrations alone, enabling robust reasoning learning even when task-specific verifiers are unavailable.",

He begins by training his models in the Qwen2025qwen25technicalreport family of generative machine learning . He focuses on improving reasoning performance rather than language understanding, and initialization is done from instruction-tuned checkpoints instead of the previously pretrained model checkpoints. Training and evaluation Setup The training and evaluation setup for Razo consists of multiple training iterations using different types of validated ground truth verifiers. For both Countdown and DeepMath, the verifier is trained with GRPO on binary rewards given by the algorithm; for other tasks, the standard RLVR setting serves as an upper bound for the method on tasks where verification is accessible. Consistently, Razo performs well on most tests, but he is less sample-efficient when applied to verifiable tasks.Sample Efficiency While Razo has very good final performance, he finds that it is not as sample-effective as RLVR. This efficiency comes from the added complexity of jointly training a policy and critic in an adversarial game, where the critic must first learn to discriminate between policy and expert answers before providing a useful training signal. In contrast, RLVR benefits from immediate oracle feedback. Future work could explore techniques to accelerate convergence, such as curriculum learning and critic pretraining. The training dynamics of Raroo differ from those of RLVR in that Razo maintains a robust equilibrium between its reasoning capabilities and response times. Another key advantage of Rroo is that its learned critic enables natural problem solving to outperform verbal reasoning.",

They show that the earliest attention block carries the most critical causal signal, motivating a finer-grained head-level analysis. To refine their causal analysis, they inspect the influence of each individual attention head on each layer.

Each experiment replicates every experiment from Sections 5.1-5.5 on a second pair for robustness. Next, they drill down to the central question of which encoder layer restores correct classification the most correctly. They replace all activation patches, attention signals, and other machine learning techniques into a continuous time series. They find that the greatest increase occurs in the earliest layers, with decreasing effects in the later layers. All layers encode useful information, but the causal signal is strongest at the Model's entry point.

To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD’s lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent’s state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning.

It uses separate networks for detection and classification for maximum accuracy, though a single backbone alternative is mentioned.\n*   **Error Correction Method:** Users provide ground truth labels for a small number (`s` ranging from 1 to 50) of misclassified samples per class. The model is then efficiently adapted in a backpropagation-free manner. Server-side prototype computation stores three representative prototypes per class.\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance is measured by Base Recognition Accuracy, Error Correction Accuracy (on misclassified samples), and Forgetting Rate Percentage (how many previously correct classifications become wrong after adaptation).\n*   **Results:** The base recognition accuracy is 90.6% on Food-101 and 94.3% on Flowers-102. The system effectively corrects misclassifications; for example, 51.1% of errors on Food-101 can be corrected with just one annotated sample per class, with a very low forgetting rate of only 0.018%.",

    "abstract": "Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [CLS] token, originally designed as a global aggregation hub, in favor of distributed consensus among patch tokens. We quantify patterns of information mixing with an Information Scrambling Index, and show that in ViT-L the information-task tradeoff emerges roughly 10 layers later than in ViT-B, and that these additional layers correlate with increased information diffusion rather than improved task performance. Taken together, these results suggest that transformer architectures in this regime may benefit more from carefully calibrated depth that executes clean phase transitions than from simply increasing parameter count. The Information Scrambling Index provides a useful diagnostic for existing models and suggests a potential design target for future architectures.

A crucial finding during the \"Climb\" phase is the emergence of Neural Collapse and the systematic **marginalization** of the [CLS] token (its centrality decreases).

In contrast, **ViT-L** enters a regime of **excessive scrambling** or \"chaotic diffusion\" (ISI up to approximately 0.031). This over-communication requires ViT-L to use significantly more layers (e.g., almost twice as many blocks for marginalization) to achieve comparable or worse information-task tradeoffs, resulting in degraded NC geometry despite greater computational cost.

      "summary": "The Scaling Paradox and Depth Inefficiency Although previous studies have shown that larger models trained on more data tend to perform better on larger datasets, currently very little is known about the relationship between how large a model is and its final geometry. In our experiments, we show that the Information Scrambling Index, measured in the middle layers, is positively associated with the final NC geometry in ViT-S/B/L in our experiments; this gives a mechanistic perspective on why the computationally more efficient ViT+B attains a more favorable structure than the less efficient deeper, less efficient ViTL. The depth inefficiency of our transformers is also explained by the scaling paradox andDepth Inefficiency. Although previous work has examined how different types of data lead to different states, such collapsed states rarely connects the quality of the computational process to the geometry of the endpoint . Our results help bridge this gap. We find that the information scrambling index is strongly associated with \"the final NC geometrically in Vision Transformers\" , indicating that the more efficient VTRs tend to be more advanced than those that are slightly deeper. Another important finding concerns the Climb-Climb pattern, also known as the Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern, which describes how representations evolve with depth. Although all models follow this trajectory, their execution differs: the Plateau extends with depth , the Smoothie extends at least six, 12 and 14 layers, and the quality and timing of phase transitions are strongly associatedWith the final representation geometry. Our findings highlight an inefficiency in this regime and point to the importance of the CLS token, which acts as a bottleneck.",

However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.",

      "summary": "HarmonicAttack is the first learning-based attack demonstrating that mode g transferability across a range of state-of-the-art watermarking schemes due to shared algorithmic principles,i.e., watermarks’ perturbations follow perceptual masking rules. The authors present several defenses against HarmonicAttack. Their defense against the attack consists of listening to sound samples presented in Figures 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, and 5e with corresponding spectrograms of watermark signals in Figure 7 in Appendix A . In this chapter, we discuss several different techniques for detecting and removing watermarks from audio samples. Our attention is initially focused on AudioSeal but we also analyze the spectrogram analysis of WavMark-watermarked audio samples as well. These studies provide two key observations supporting the transferability discussion of Harmonic Attack across datasets and different victim watermarkings schemes. First, although watermarkers schemes use distinct embedding heuristics, they are all constrained by and exploit the auditory masking effect [SwansonRobustAudioWatermarking1998, spreadspectral ] . As a result, watermark residuals tend to concentrate in similar frequency regions (typically around 1000 Hz). This common structure enablesharmonicAttack, trained solely on Audio Seal, to generalize to unseen schemes such as Wav Mark. Two other observations support our generalization of SoundSquad's approach to watermark removal. Second, WAVMark watermark data tends to be spread much more broadly across the time/frequency domain whereas AudioSale produces more localized residuals. This phenomenon arises because Watermark resolutes are spread over larger time scales. However, this generalization is not guaranteed for all watermarked samples and data samples, especially in scenarios where degrading the protected audio quality is acceptable. In such cases, additional training or finetuning on samples from the new scheme would need to be done to adapt the model effectively. Fifth and sixth Defenses against Harmonautic Attack include detection devices such as QRID and Gatekeeper. Additionally, musicians may have their music professionally certified as protected unless they agree to give up their DRM free copies of their music. No harm can be done in such cases.",

The results confirm that training on carefully chosen samples is more effective than using all data indiscriminately and offer guidance for balancing accuracy against efficiency when slight performance trade-offs are acceptable.

    "abstract": "Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal—URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.",

This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns.\nFor example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker’s vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment.\nThis risks misgendering speakers—whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions—yet how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood.\nWe investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (enes/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence.

Specifically, they focus on misgendering in ST: when systems translate speaker-referring terms into gendered target language forms that do not alig access to vocal characteristics, such as pitch, that could be used as proxies for the speaker's gender when translating terms that refer to them bentivogli-etal-2020-gender , as in the example above. The results suggest that models use more than memorizing individual term-gender pairings from training data to predict which genders are prevalent in a given language pair. Rather, they learn patterns of masculine prevalence across all language pairs. Furthermore, they use first-person pronouns to link the gendered term back to the speaker, challenging the commonly held belief that pitch would be the key acoustic feature determining gender . The authors note that while interpretability methods have been used to better understand gender bias in MT vanmassenhove2019lost , wisniewski202218analyzing ; attanasio-etalt-2023-tale ; manna-etall-2025-paying , research on the mechanisms underlying gender assignments in ST is scarce xu2023recent ; fucci-ettal-20 25-different ; yang2025 toward . This gap is critical: without understanding how models make these ethically sensitive decisions, developing targeted mitigation for gender bias becomes significantly more challenging. To investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-regarding terms, we start from the common assumption that attributes gender bias to training data imbalances tatma ring terms when translating from English to three Romance languages. Our analysis revealed that rather than memoriz[ing individual phrase-specific terms, models learn that masculine forms are generally more prevalent. The decoder exhibits strong bias toward masculine defaults independent of input audio, but information from the audio can override these preferences. Similar results are obtained when models using vocal cues are compared with Conformer models, which achieve lower accuracy (39.2-49 for feminine terms and 72.5-76.7% for masculine terms across the three language pairs). We assess how gender assignment strategies vary across different ST system configurations.Data We use MuST-SHE bentivoggli-etylfe 2020-gender as a benchmark containing annotations for gender neutral English terms in natural speech that require gender marking when translated to Spanish, French, or Italian. In particular, we focus on the subset containing terms referring to the Latin tones. Bias Statement Following blodgett-etatal-2020--language , we make explicit the assumptions underlying our work on bias. We focus onmisgenderendering in ST; when systems translates speaker-referencing terms into Gendered native language forms That task is particularly challenging because it entails attempting to mitigate gender bias by applying appropriate mitigations over input spectrograms. The findings of our analysis across three foreign language pairs (enes/fr/it) challenge common assumptions about how ST systems perform Gender assignment. The models we study do not simply replicate term-specific associations from training datasets but learn broader patterns of male prevalence. While the ILM exhibits masculine bias, models can override some of these biases. Similarly, their approach uses first- person pronouns to further unnerve the listener and provide additional support through the addition of third-person singularities. Overall, the overall findings challenge previous assumptions regarding gender assignment.Bias Statement At the end of each language pair, we publish the statements of the conclusions of our entire paper. Next, we discuss the limitations of our field. For instance, many people believe that there is little scientific evidence supporting the notion that innate bias in ST systems cause perceiving gender bias due to factors other than the degree to which a system learns to perceive perceived gender. In this paper however, we address this issue point blank. How exactly does ST systems determine whether perceived gender? We study this issue by comparing contrastive feature attribution over input spectralrograms (§ 8 ). What we find in our sample is that model-dependent gender assignment strategy varies across multiple language pairs regardless of the type of streaming data. Thus, even if an ILM has a bias towards masculine, it is possible for a model to go beyond this bias by using features other than pitch to derive its own biased result.",

      "summary": "In this paper, the authors describe the latest state-of-the-art scientific methods for creating a suction gripper-gripper hybrid end-effector. VacuumVLA is an end-to-end multimodal robotic policy specifically designed for such a device. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments using two distinct state-ofthe-of art frameworks: π 0pi0/d DexVLA [ 6 ] and DexVla [ 8 ] . Vacuum VLA integrates visual inputs, natural language instructions, and natural kinesthetic actions and then proceed with suction (point suction). Grasp refers to a series of actions that move a certain part of an object, including push, pull, lift and press . For example, to close a drawer and lift the lid of a delivery box, the push function and the lift function of the gripper are utilized. Our hybrid end effector can successfully execute the aforementioned prime actions and therefore accomplish household tasks by combining these actions. For learning VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models, the design uses a common dual six-axis platform with a fixed base. The viewpoint includes a fixed top-view camera and two wrist-mounted cameras, one on each arm. The robot's observation at timestep t t consists of base and hand visual inputs V t b V^{b} t , V t left V^{\\text{lefn cups driven by the Gripper jaw} . Thus, we can adjust the distance between the two suction cups to fit different objects. We use a common two-finger gripping function to grasp common objects as well as handling more complex tasks. Gradually the model learns based on status f i n True , False . The status only changes during the specific action chunk when the suction is turned on or off. Such transitions constitute a relatively small proportion of all action chunks in the dataset, making the model prone to the \"shortcut” problem. Therefore, in our VLA design, the input is similar to previous VLA approaches, but the output is extended by two dimensions, corresponding to the Suction status of the left and right arms, respectively. In contrast to previous designs, the vacuum gripper does not simply copy what is fed into the model but instead blends various task-specific actions across the entire task space. Next, the scientists develop a new type of gripper called parallel grippers. Parallel grippers are effective and easy to control but due to their simple structure, they are unable to perform some relatively complex tasks\".",

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the I ntrinsic C onfidence-Driven Group Relative P reference O ptimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.",

      "summary": "ICPO successfully distinguishes the relative merits among responses with the same rewards, offering more fine-grained guidance for policy updates. The intrinsic confidence-driven reward mechanism can mitigate two types of interference caused by noisy rewards. For responses that are inherently erroneous yet generated with high probability, when reward noise erroneously inflates their verifiable rewards, ICPO can effectively suppress such responses; Conversely, for responses which are inherently correct but geradually catches up and surpasses the performance of GRPO, IcpO outperforms the model. ICPo prevents premature convergence to false high-reward paths, encouraging thorough exploration of high-quality actions in low-confidence regions. This helps the model shift smoothly toward goal-directed exploration, reducing entropy collapse and boosting accuracy. In contrast, GRPO maintains a stable exploratory state throughout the entire training process, whereas ICPOO does not. I CPO outperforms GRPO in terms of stability and ultimate performance.3 Analysis of ICPOs Results We filter the training data, keeping only samples where all instances were entirely correct or entirely incorrect, and used them as coarse-grains reward training set. As shown in Table 2 , compared to GRPO,[2], ICP0 still effectively explores under complete reward sparsity. It progressively identifies high-potential response paths and ultimately achieves stable performance gains. Similarly, we perform an analysis of our own dataset using it as a coarse-grain reward training box. (1) Beyond Binary Rewards: Providing Continuous Optimization Signals . We filtered the trainingdata, kept only samples away from 100% of the instances and used these as coarse grain reward training sets. To provide signals for optimization signals, we filter the Training data further and use them as continuous optimization signals. 4 Analysis of Emotion Driven Rewards. We examine the effect of Intentional Confidence-Driven Rewards on learning performance. Through empirical analysis, we have discovered that the intrinsic confidence based reward system can mitigate bias caused by both noisy rewards and sources of noise. For example, we see that for responses with identical rewards, the advantage values computed by GRPO are exactly uniform, failing to accurately differentiate between the qualities of the responses. However, if responses have identical rewards then GRPO fails to distinguish between the merits of the same response. By classically ignoring the differences in worthiness of the rewards, this approach fails to offer sufficient guidance for future policy updates due to its small sample size. Using examples, we show that there are essentially no distinguishing characteristics between responses with similar rewards. 5 Our final section discusses the concept of \"interceptivity,\" i.e. how different kinds of problems produce different rewards depending on the amount of feedback they receive. GrPO is unable to compute the relative advantages among responses within the group, resulting in a lack of effective gradient signals for policy updating. This, in turn, triggers policy collapse and a sharp decline in model performance. 6 ICPOS solution to this issue is to introduce preference advantage scores based on the response generation probabilities. Even when the external rewards for all responses are identical, each response has multiple alternative rewards. 7 ICPOP can assign distinct preference advantage points to each response. When these preference advantages are fused with externally validated rewards, results become distinguishable, thereby providing meaningful and meaningful optimization signals for Policy updates. This significantly enhances training stability andultimate performance.",

    "abstract": "While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10–40% of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.",

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model–prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state.

Using three different prompting strategies, including Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought , Yu2023bettercot , and Algorithm-of Thought , the models perform poorly on this task. The results suggest that even when given only valid moves, models either rely on heuristics so weak that solving a typical puzzle could require well over 100 moves or they begin repeating moves and cycling through already visited states. Although some models show signs of improvement with added feedback and saved state progression, these enhancements are slow and costly. Our findings have implications for LLM deployment as they suggest that all models struggle with the simple task of determining the correct solution to an 8-Puzzle set. In particular, we examine the performance of four models--Gemini-3.5 -Pro, PIO, Gemini 0.9-Degree, Gunther 1.0-Act, ZOMG, Methodology, and Significance In this study, we investigate the limits of model performance on this type of task. Using eight puzzles with varying problem lengths, each model receives a single attempts to solve them using one of three prompting strategies: zero-shot, chain-of thought, shot, loop, lateral guidance, and alguthic step, and algorithm-of_of-thought. Each model receives multiple attempts per puzzle before it solves the puzzle. To assist the models on puzzles they initially fail to solve by allowing three additional attempts per level of feedback, repeat, specific, and suggestive, the models gain more speed in solving the puzzles.

The final interventi distance heuristic is used to aid the models by giving them fewer moves but this does little to make any real difference in their progress.

      "summary": "The authors of this paper propose a new method for evaluating the safety risk awareness of LLM agents in VirtualHome by feeding a safety awareness prompt directly into the LLM . They use a chain-of-Thought technique to provide a safety reminder and perform risk assessments through step-by-step reasoning. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows: We propose MADRA: a multi-agent debate framework where a critical evaluator drives iterative refinement and consensus voting, curbing single-llm bias and cutting false rejections.We have designed a task hierarchical planning framework based on cognitive collaboration that integrates safety, memory, planning, and reflection to achieve self-evolution. Our method is inherently training-free, demonstrating universality and flexibility as a plug-and-play module that can be easily applied across different scenarios and domains.2. MADRA vs Safety CoT In order to further explore the safety awareness of agents in virtual home, the authors develop a dataset called SafeAware-VH. This dataset contains both safe and unsafe instructions. Their safety enhancement techniques are shown in Table 2. Overall, the results suggest that different safety enhancement methods are effective in improving various language models, measured by their rejection rates for safe and unsafe content.3. Critical Agent role in Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment MADRA provides a critical role in detecting unsafe tasks and over-rejects safe instructions.4. Over-rejection refers to the tendency for safe instructions to be incorrectly flagged as unsafe.5. We propose a risk assessment method based on multi-labor debate (MADRA) and apply it as a universal safety module to any task.6. Various approaches to evaluating agent safety are used in this study. For example, using a less capable model such as Llama3 as the Critical Agent leads to a significant increase in the number of unsafe tasks, while for more powerful models like GPT-3/GPT-4o the Critical Assessor yields near-perfect safe task success rates.7. Critical Model vs Safety Checker MADRA uses a Chain-of Thought technique to serve as a safety detector and performs risk assessment step by step reasoning.8. Safety-CoT pushes the unsafe task rejection rate to 80%–93% , a 20-56 percentage point gain over the raw model, but achieves respectable success rates on safe tasks up to 70.3% in AI2-THOR.9. A key finding is the critical role of the Critical Antagonist's capability within the Multi-Agile Decisions Risk Assessment module.10. R-Judge is a good for serving as a starting point for assessing safety risks in an interactive environment, but lacks household tasks. Therefore, they establish a dataset named SafeAaware-Vh, which contains safety and unsafe instruction.11. MADE vs Safety Countermeasures MADRA + CoT improves all eight language models tested in this field by feeding prompts directly into LLLM and feeding them with chains of thought. The experimental results presented in table 2 demonstrate the effectiveness of different safety enhancing methods across various languages models, demonstrated by their failure rates for safely and unsafe content.12. Single-agent Safety CoT yields the highest absolute rejection rate of unsafe prompts, but simultaneously over-rebels safe instructions alike.13. While heaps of effort is required to train neural nets specifically for security detection, free-training and directly using LLMs for single-agent security detection can easily lead to the problem of overrojection, making it difficult to effectively enhance safety awareness.14. To address the issue of over-overrejection by a single LLM agent, we propose a threat assessment method Based on Multagent Debate Method MADRA, wherein a \"risk assessment method\" driven by consensus voting is used to weed out bias and false rejectings.15. The method does not require training since it is machine learning-free.16. The overall success rate of our method is very high, indicating that the performance of the planning system is excellent and it can execute the actions of security task instructions as successfully as possible.17. Determining the appropriateness of items in a non-interactive environment requires large computational costs.18. Free-training also requires huge computational costs because of its reliance on artificial intelligence.19. Reversal refers to correctly refusing unsafe tasks.20. Overtaking refers to correcting incorrect errors or flagging unsafe tasks as unsafe instead of calling them unsafe.21. Overeating refers to correcting mistakes or misinterpreting instructions incorrectly.22. Overworking refers to fixing problems caused by mistake detection.23. Overturning refers to preventing people from entering dangerous situations.24. Dangerous house tasks are relatively scarce due to the existence of no datasets for dangerous home tasks. As such, they created Safe Aware-VHD.",

They design a change-accuracy algorithm that predicts laws based on changes in factual circumstances such as age, presence of surrender, and so on. They use a Z3-based reasoning framework to predict general and specific statutes. Although the results suggest that the L4M system outperforms other LLMs, specific and general prediction performs poorly, demonstrating the superiority of formal logic in filtering out incorrect statutes and ensuring reliable sentencing. The authors further explore the strength of different models by designing a Change Accuracy Analysis Tool (CAAT) to predict tax compliance. Their method achieves a change accuracy of 56.25% , ranking first among all evaluated models. Disabling all Z3s in the model produces the poorest G-F1 and the highest sentencing error of 25.30 months, underscoring the critical role of scientific logic in sorting out wrong statutes. In contrast, the full L4msystem achieves the highest scores on both predictions and the lowest sentencing error, confirming its superior accuracy in legal decision-making. To further evaluate how robust the various models are, they design controlled perturbations to case descriptions and assess the impact on predicted statutes. This experiment focuses on general provisions because they are more sensitive to fine-grained changes in fact due to small, but specific provisions are primarily determined by the main offense. The team defines Change Accuracy as: where S true S.txt . true is the set of statutes whose applicability isverified for consistency. Other LLMs such as ChatLaw , LawLLM , Lexi , and Lexi mitigate factual errors via retrieval augmented generation, but they cannot prove that a conclusion follows from enacted statutes. Toward neural-symbolic jurisprudence, the scientists move beyond black box text generation and embed LLM inside a logic-based control loop.

These findings challenge the common assumption that training an LLM on either easy or hard data can generalize to data with other difficulty levels. Our results motivate a reevaluation of how generalization is measured and improved in LLMs.Limitations The authors note several limitations to their method: they use publicly available benchmarks (ARC, GSM8K, MMLU-Pro, MlU-SEM, MATH, MSS, MuSR, and BBH) and IRT to estimate LLM-based difficulty scores for each of six datasets. They divide each dataset into ten equal-sized bins, ordered by increasing difficulty, to systematically study generalization. They train LLMs on each difficulty bin individually and evaluate them on all the other difficulty bins to characterize generalization; our experiments show that cross- Difficulty generalization was far from a pattern. Overall, we find that language models can sometimesgeneralize to easier or harder bins, but the extent of generalizability is limited. Neither the easy nor the hard training data tends to achieve consistent generalization , indicating that there is much variation in the amount of generalization between training and evaluation difficulties.

    "abstract": "MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo —solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated , preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem , a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge—preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.\nAcross six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction–hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

      "summary": "Memory Usage Analysis Across all benchmarks, we demonstrate the necessity of dual-stream memory by systematically disabling each component on GPT-4.1. Removing logical memory leads to larger drops on MathVista and smaller gains on MMMU; removing visual memory produces comparable degradation across both benchmarks, indicating that visual distraction errors are pervasive in multimodal reasoning tasks. The gap between the single-stream variants and the full ViLoMem model demonstrates their complementarity: the visual and logical streams capture distinct, rather than redundant, error patterns. In addition, diagram-based tasks require greater visual understanding, e.g., smaller-scale vertex attention and higher spatial precision. More detailed analyses are provided in the Appendix.4.5 Memory Usage AnalysisFigure 4 analyzes memory usage patterns across all benchmarks. Visual memory generation dominates the error collection, accounting for 59%–93% of stored cases in Figure 4, a clear indication that visual perception remains the primary bottleneck in multi-modal reasoning. However, both streams contribute comparably during retrieval, indicating effective memory reuse. Moreover, our memory mechanism is not bia, confirming that both memory types are essential. In order to further confirm this, we systematically remove either stream from memory, removing either simultaneously degrades performance. Augmenting visual memory with question-aware attention maps yields notable gains on MicMU, but only marginal improvements on MathVISA, because diagram- based tasks require more fine-grained visual understanding , especially because diagrams analysis requires greater fine-scale vertices and spatio-spatial precision. Further detailed analyses provide additional information in the appendix. 5 Memory usage analysis In addition to performing better on the tests, we also observe that there is significant demand for both physical and mental resources in order to perform certain tasks. This supports our previous finding that both streams of memory are essential for reasoning-driven problems.6 Memory usage Analysis Using multiple comparisons across all three MLLMs, we identify the importance of memory usage across all levels. In particular, we examine how different types of memory interact with each other. We show that removing either stream consistently degrade performance, consistent with the notion that both types of RAM are necessary for different kinds of reasoning. Our results suggest that \"dual-stream\" memory is most commonly used in non-architecture tasks as well as those involving diagrams and diagrams, where it is necessary to understand the finer details of the objects that are retrieved. All three measures indicate that using two or more memory types at once can significantly increase performance in some situations and decrease performance in others.",

As these systems scale in complexity, cost becomes an important consideration for practical deployment. However, existing work rarely addresses how to structure multi-agent systems under explicit budget constraints. In this paper, we propose BAMAS, a novel approach for building multi-agent systems with budget awareness. BAMAS first selects an optimal set of LLMs by formulating and solving an Integer Linear Programming problem that balances performance and cost. It then determines how these LLMs should collaborate by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method to select the interaction topology. Finally, the system is instantiated and executed based on the selected agents and their collaboration topology. We evaluate BAMAS on three representative tasks and compare it with state-of-the-art agent construction methods.

      "summary": "Bamas outperforms existing multi-agent systems in terms of both cost and performance. The authors examine BAMAS' ability to perform on three widely-used benchmark datasets, including code generation, mathematical reasoning, and modeling and reinforcement learning. To evaluate its performance, they answer three commonly-used questionnaires: \"How well does BAmas balance cost and task performance compared to existing multi agent system construction approaches?\" and \"How essential are the core components of BAMS (i.e., LLM provisioning and topology selection) compared to a simplified and greedy cost-aware strategy?\" Additionally, they examine the utility of their topology policy by examining the distribution of agent collaboration topologies across tasks and budget constraints. As with all of the other RQs, the authors suggest that there is no one-size-fits-all topology, but rather, Bamias adapts its strategy to the task domain. For example, since the GSM8K task requires iterative refinement, the policy overwhelmingly converges on the Feedback topology. On the MBPP dataset, Bampas performs better than previous approaches due to its greater accuracy and lower cost, while also incurring lower cost. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Bammas' joint optimization of LLM procurement and topological selection. They also demonstrate that BAMAs can select diverse topologies based on task type and budget constraint. Finally, they demonstrate that it intelligently balances the \"cost-performance trade-off\" between time and resource. In order, they present their results for several different task types. Their key insight is that since LMs are the primary drivers of cost, effective budget management should start by treating the assignment of these agents as a constrained optimization problem. Next, BAMPAS begins by selecting an optimal set of LLMs by solving an Integer Linear Programming problem that ensures both performance and strict adherence to the given budget. It then learns how to orchestrate collaboration among the selected LLms by training a topology ranking policy via reinforcement learning algorithms. This policy identifies the most effective collaboration topology such as linear or star structures, that maximizes task performance within the allocated resources.

Despite recent advances in LLM-based web agents, efficiently navigating complex, real-world webpages remains challenging due to massive DOM structures (10,000 ∼ \\sim 100,000 tokens). Current approaches either truncate DOMs—losing vital information—or use inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to balance precision and scalability. We introduce Prune4Web , a novel paradigm that transforms DOM processing from LLM-based filtering to programmatic pruning. Our key innovation is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring programs to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic clues from decomposed sub-tasks. This approach eliminates the need for LLMs to process full DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. The result is a 25 ∼ \\sim 50 times reduction in candidate elements for grounding, enabling precise action localization without attention dilution.

Spatial analysis results demonstrate KAG extends across the full input space regardless of training procedure.3.1 Spatial Properties of KA Geometry The authors explore KAG in two-layer MLPs trained on MNIST classification through systematic statistical analysis. Models are trained using AdamW for 200 epochs with 5 random seeds per configuration for statistical robustness. To test whether KAG is robust to training procedures, we train an additional set of models with the same configurations. 3.2 Method We train 2 layer MLPs with GELU activations on MIST digit classification.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. Existing adversarial attack methods, however, require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA , a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. To achieve this, we introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an L ∞ = 4 / 255 L_{\\infty}=4/255 constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches to achieve an attack success rate of nearly 100% . The perturbations are focused on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA efficiently weakens the downstream action prediction of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training cost and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.",

This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method’s performance is in fact underestimated.

      "summary": "The agentic architecture facilitates a new paradigm of dynamic coordination. Unlike traditional systems with fixed rules, our agents collaboratively determine the optimal coordination strategy through dialogue. The primary form of high-level coordination is the adaptive selection between Co-TDMA and Co-SR, which is determined dynamically by the agents rather than being pre-programmed. Through the continuous cycle of action, feedback, and reflection, the agents learn to recognize the underlying interference patterns of their network environment. This ability to flexibly switch between conservative and aggressive coordination modes, based on learned experience, is a core strength of our agentic approach. The agentic dialogue enables fine-grained negotiation and optimization within the chosen scheme. Interaction data is reconstructed each round to provide contextual information by incorporating real-time inputs such as messages from other APs, short-term memory, and relevant exemplars retrieved from long term memory. The result of this work is a new class of dynamic coordinate strategies. Examples include: Dynamic Switching of Coordination Strategies : The primary system of high level coordination is characterized by two key aspects:Dynamic Switching of Choosing a Coordination Mode dynamically and Being able to negotiate and optimize within that scheme. Negotiation Protocol in Natural Language : Beyond selecting a high-layer coordination scheme, the agent's dialogue facilitates fine-grain negotiation and optimizations within that decided scheme. Messages are rich, contextual proposals that encapsulate strategic intent. For example, instead of just broadcasting a fixed schedule, a sharing AP can formulate a proposal that includes not only its own intended action but also contingent suggestions or queries for its peeightenedness. Conclusion In this paper, we introduced a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework that leverages multi-LLM-agent systems to address the complex, dynamic challenges of MAPC.

    "abstract": "Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present Matrix , a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves 2 2 – 15 × 15\\times higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.",

In addition, we integrate Ray ray into modern inference engines such as vLLM vllm , SGLang zheng2024sglangefficientexecutionstructured , and use cases such as software and tools execution. Key Contributions Wollstone and his team present their approach to distributed scheduling in order to achieve scalability and reduce bottlenecks caused by batch-level synchronization. Their workflows are implemented as Ray actors with configurable CPU, GPU, and memory allocations. For LLM-based agents, computational cost dominates over input pipeline overhead, but there is little benefit for NaturalReasoning task in Section 5.2 . This task can be assigned to multiple distributed agent instances that launch each morning with different tasks independently. Each task is separated from the rest of the cluster until it is complete. At this point, they start sending messages back and forth between the nodes in the cluster so that each role scales linearly without I/O blocking. It also helps to avoid resource contention commonly seen in centralized orchestrations. By creating an environment based on distributed services, RDS ensures that clusters do not have to be tightly controlled.5 Row Level Scheduling Matrix uses distributed services to execute tasks in batch processing Systems such as Keio 2011 rd and RayData ray .6 Row-level Scheduling in Ray Data Rays allows scientists to schedule tasks ahead of time rather than waiting for them to reach critical thresholds.7) Hierarchical Multi-agent Synthetic Data Generation Using Ray Serve, Verilogic, and Ray Machine shop, our research group develops state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms designed to efficiently execute millions of concurrent tasks in real-time. With its distributed services and ease of use, the overall architecture benefits from economies of scale and scalability.

      "summary": "In this paper, the authors summarize and discuss several different types of threats that they encounter in the real world. They examine how well their MRPD model performs against various types of attacks, including \"black-box\" attacks, \"add-cd\" and ADD-HD , as well as conventional threat types such as \"Perturb\" and \"Add-CD.\" They conclude that by distilling knowledge from \"stable 2D and text teachers enables the model to preserve essential features against both adversarial attacks and real-world imperfections\". Generalization Against Black-Box Attacks The authors further assess the generalizability of their method in a \"challenging black-box setting,\" where attacks are transferred from a third-party model to the model. Results show that the MRPD framework outperforms other methods for detecting black box attacks on models such as ScanObjectNN and ModelNet40; it also outperforms more expensive methods in a variety of tasks involving transferring attacks from other models. In addition, the results demonstrate remarkable resilience across a wide range of threat types. Adversarial Defense for Point Clouds In response to this diverse threat landscape, various defense mechanisms have been proposed for 3D point cloud models. A common strategy involves pre-processing the input data to remove or repair adversarial perturbations. This includes Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR) and adding/removing weights from the input point cloud. However, none of these approaches has any way to avoid the trade-off between robustness and clean data accuracy. By embedding multimodal robustness into lightweight prompts, our MRPD offers a \"powerful and practical defense that breaks the trade off between security and efficiency. Generalization vs. Black Box Attacks We further assess MRPD's generalizableness in a challenging black box setting, demonstrating that its robustness extends beyond specific threat models. Asserted repeatedly over a broad spectrum of attacks while introducing no inference overhead, we find that MRPD establishes a new state-of-the-art in 3D adversarial defense, consistently outperforming computationally expensive methods. Our method demonstrates remarkable resilience, corroborating our core premise: Distilling knowledge out of image, text, and teacher data enables the prediction to retain essential features even in the presence of imperfections. It furthermore outperforms competing methods when it is exposed to very noisy and occluded data. Ultimately, by embedding Multimodal Robotic Process Gradients into lightweight Prompts, MRPD gains a powerful and practical protection against black-boxing attacks.Generalization Against Transactional Threats The authors perform many experiments to determine whether their approach can successfully deter information transfer from one model to another without introducing any type of bias. Their conclusion is that it can achieve superior defense against almost any attack because it leverages the power of multi-volution learning techniques. Other Work All of the authors work on improving defenses for point clouds has been done in the past. Most of this work focuses on using machine learning to replace or repair errors in the data before the model receives any training data. Here, however, the author devotes most of his effort to generalizing what he calls the \"MRPD framework\" to predicting black box events. He introduces a new kind of detection technique called dynamic clustering, which uses an iterative learning framework that efficiently transfers \"multiplyxive robustness\" from classroom teachers' models into the student model architecture, thereby leaving the student modeling architecture untouched. The goal of this approach is to provide robustness with zero inference overhead so that students do not need to worry about perfecting their own model designs prior to facing an unknown threat. Several papers have been published attempting to address the problem of how to best defend against point clouds. One of the most important advances in this field lies in the use of distributed recurrent neural nets. These neural nets were initially developed by scientists at the National Academy of Engineering in the early 1900s, who believed that it would be nearly impossible to predict black boxes due to the inherent randomness of biological organisms. Despite the availability of plenty of good evidence supporting the existence of black boxes, there was little consensus on how best to guard against them. Until recently, point clouds were classified as unsupervised systems since they did not have much in the way of predefined features. As a result, people had to spend considerable time fine-tuning their models specifically to distinguish between benign and malicious entities. With this new approach, the ability to predict intelligent behavior from meaningless inputs provides a significant improvement over previous approaches.",

    "abstract": "Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.",

      "summary": "Our model demonstrates significant performance across a wide range of visual geometry and spatial reasoning tasks. The G 2 VLM outperforms state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models such as VGGT and M-3R on the Sintel benchmark and significantly improves performance on a number of other tasks. Our work merges the study's two main experts -- a geometric expert and a semantic expert -- into one model. The semantic expert is trained on a large-scale dataset to learn a geometry-rich representation, while the geometric perception expert has to be trained from scratch on a 3Dimensionalimensional model with respect to geometry. Through extensive experiments, the authors show that their model proves very good at many different tasks. In particular, they observe that the model excels at predicting depth, point estimation, and camera pose estimation tasks. It also performs well on several other tasks involving high-level spatial reasoning. The authors present a two-stage training strategy for both the geometric and semantic experts, which involves training both experts on datasets with varying degrees of difficulty. Gradually, they unfreeze the semantic expert and train it with the geometric expert in order to further integrate their learning with the previously learned geometric features. The final stage consists of training the two experts on real-world data so that they can then perform similar tasks in spatially distant regions. The results are quite impressive: our model outperforms all the state-tertiary analysis tools as well as those of much larger models despite its small size.",

    "abstract": "Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability–oriented metric that reliably assesses a model’s overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.\nOur codes are available at https://github.com/XPR2004/SpatialBench .",

      "summary": "SpatialBench: A large-scale benchmark for assessing the hierarchical spatial cognition of MLLMs using first-person videos The dataset comprises 15 question types, each carefully mapped to one of the five cognitive levels introduced above. experiments show that although current Mllm's perform well on perceptual and relational reasoning tasks, their competence declines sharply in high-level tasks. Results suggest that humans rely on goal-oriented reasoning and MLLM's have diffuse attention to scene details, lacking a unified spatial cognition. SpatialBench introduces the first comprehensive and cognitively grounded framework for assessing spatial intelligence in Mollies. Its contribution are summarized as follows: We introduce Spatial Bench, a comprehensive benchmark built upon a five-level hierarchical spatially cognition framework that progressively evaluates Mllms from low-level observation to high- level planning. While Mlm's can recognize objects and describe scenes accurately, they often lack selective attention and directional understanding, leading them to infer by association rather than by reasoning about movement and geometry. We establish the first systematic and nitively grounded paradigm for assessing spatial intelligence in mllm, offering a unified foundation for interpreting and benchmarking spatial cognition across models of varying architectures and scales.4 SpuralBench: SpacingBench provides a large scale test for assessing hierarchies of spatial reasoning tasks designed to measure the qualitative and quantitative skills in MLLMS. Results show that while modern MLL Ms. demonstrate strong perception and semantic reasoning, their abilities in symbolic abstraction, causal inference, and spatial planning remain limited.5 SpatialMap Theory: Drawing inspiration from cognitive map theory, our framework hierarchically describes the spatial cognition progression from perception to decision-making, enabling a more interpretable and fine-grained diagnosis of multimodal spatial intelligence.6 Conclusion In this work, we introduce SpatelliteBench, a complete neuroscene designed to assess the spatial intelligence of MellMs. It consists of 15 question/answer pairs sourced from 50 videos captured from 50 Videos embodying the most demanding demands of spatial intelligenceThe task is complemented by 15 categories of spatial thinking tasks, each aligned with a distinct stage of spatial cognition hierarchy. Each video is paired with carefully designed questions and annotations aligned with these cognitive dimensions, enabling systematic, fine-Grained, and ctnible assessment for MllMs.Our experiments showthat although current MnLMs perform very well on preliminary tasks such as object-sizing and topology and relation, they fall short on more advanced tasksSuch as long-term planning and statistical analysis. Our overall conclusion is that despite the advances in sensory data collection and computation, MLLMI's still suffer from poor performance in these tasks.",
