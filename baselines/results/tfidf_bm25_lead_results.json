        "paragraphs": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in scene understanding, visual question answering, and complex scientific problem solving [ bai2025qwen2 , wu2024deepseek , zhang2025abstractive , zhao2025efficient ] . Yet despite their growing capability, current MLLMs approach each problem de novo \u2014solving every query in isolation, repeatedly re-deriving the same insights and re-committing familiar errors [ fang2025comprehensive , zhang2025survey , gao2025survey , tan2025prospect ] . Although recent memory-augmented models attempt to mitigate this by storing past interactions [ suzgun2025dynamic , zhang2025ace ] , these memories capture only high-level logical summaries while discarding the visual grounding and perceptual cues essential for multimodal reasoning.\nRecent research has demonstrated that MLLMs\u2019 visual perception ability remains fundamentally weaker than their linguistic reasoning, with low-level perceptual failures identified as a primary bottleneck for high-level multimodal reasoning tasks [ lu2021mathvista , sun2025mathglance , tong2024eyes ] . In mathematical multimodal problem-solving in particular, diagram-perception errors exceed logical reasoning errors, and visual mistakes frequently persist in intermediate reasoning steps even when the final answer is correct [ zhang2025primitive ] .\nThis indicates visual attention errors directly cause\ndownstream logical hallucinations that creates a cascading failure pattern [ wu2024combating , zhou2025perception ] . Our ablation studies further confirm this phenomenon: across six multimodal problem-solving benchmarks, the proportion of visual error summaries consistently exceeds that of logical memory errors (Fig. 4 ). Therefore, when solving problems paired with images, it is\nessential for models to maintain accurate visual attention to task-relevant regions, avoiding perceptual distractions that propagate into flawed logical inferences.\nLogic-only memory is insufficient for multimodal problem solving. While logical theorems and rules are general (e.g., applying the base\u2013height formula for area computation), effective reasoning also requires aligning these abstract rules with their correct visual counterparts (e.g., the shape of triangles). As illustrated in Fig. 1 , triangles exhibit diverse visual configurations, and early attempts may contain both logical and visual errors. Through feedback, the model refines its logical memory for question-appropriate theorem application and its visual memory to avoid perceptual traps, attending to task-relevant regions.\nThis progressive learning mirrors the human cognitive system, where semantic memory maintains multimodal representations that integrate visual experience with abstract reasoning [ jneuro2024multimodal ] .\nWe thus introduce ViLoMem , a dual-stream memory framework that separately models visual distraction patterns and logical hallucination errors as structured schemas, coordinating them through unified retrieval.\nFollowing a grow-and-refine principle, ViLoMem avoids the detail erosion caused by iterative rewriting by filtering similar error patterns and using tailored add/skip and retrieval strategies to incrementally accumulate multimodal semantic knowledge. Specifically, we design custom retrieval strategies for visual and logical streams. For the visual stream, direct image-similarity search is insufficient; the key requirement is helping the model identify question-specific \u201cvisually trapped regions\u201d. To achieve question-aware attention, we generate cross-modal attention maps guided by keywords (previously observed visual mistakes), enabling the model to highlight regions associated with known error patterns relevant to the current question. For the logical stream, instead of directly retrieving query semantically similar logics, the model first analyzes the problem to identify its underlying subject and reasoning requirements\u2014supporting precise positioning of the task type and precise selection of the relevant logical schema.\nOverall, ViLoMem automatically attributes successes or failures to the visual or logical stream and updates the corresponding schemas without human supervision. It enables progressive mistake reduction and cross-domain knowledge transfer in multimodal tasks. Our contributions are summarized as follows:\nWe propose ViLoMem , the first framework that explicitly separates visual distraction errors from logical hallucination errors , constructing a dual-stream memory inspired by multimodal semantic memory in the human cognitive system.\nViLoMem employs a question-aware attention mask for visual images and a precise\u2010positioning \u2013 precise\u2010selection regime for logical retrieval, together with filtering-based memory update strategies to avoid detail erosion, enabling coordinated retrieval between visual cues and logical constraints. This directs attention to task-relevant regions while suppressing invalid logical inferences.\nExtensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy across diverse model scales, achieving substantial gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.48 on MathVision for GPT-4.1, +4.38 on MMMU for Qwen3-VL-8B). Ablation studies confirm that both memory streams are essential and complementary, exhibiting heterogeneous effects across benchmarks\u2013task-aligned domains benefit from shared memory, whereas mismatched domains can lead to interference.",

        "title": "3 Method",
        "paragraphs": "We propose ViLoMem , a plug-in dual-stream memory framework for multimodal reasoning in large language models, featuring a closed-loop Memory Cycle that enables the agent to continuously learn from its reasoning and perception errors\u2014facilitating progressive, lifelong learning.\nProblem Formulation. Consider a sequence of multimodal inputs ( x 1 , x 2 , \u2026 , x n ) (x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}) , where each input x i = ( I i , q i ) x_{i}=(I_{i},q_{i}) consists of an image I i I_{i} and a question text q i q_{i} . The system maintains two memory banks: a logic memory \u2133 i L = { m 1 L , m 2 L , \u2026 , m | L | L } \\mathcal{M}^{L}_{i}=\\{m^{L}_{1},m^{L}_{2},\\ldots,m^{L}_{|L|}\\} storing textual reasoning guidelines, and a visual memory \u2133 i V = { ( m 1 V , I 1 V ) , ( m 2 V , I 2 V ) , \u2026 , ( m | V | V , I | V | V ) } \\mathcal{M}^{V}_{i}=\\{(m^{V}_{1},I^{V}_{1}),(m^{V}_{2},I^{V}_{2}),\\ldots,(m^{V}_{|V|},I^{V}_{|V|})\\} storing visual guidelines paired with source images.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2 (a), the cycle operates as follows: given problem x i x_{i} , the system performs parallel Retrieval from both memory banks to obtain relevant memories R i L R^{L}_{i} and R i V R^{V}_{i} . These retrieved memories are then fed to the Solver for Utilization , which generates a candidate answer y ~ i \\tilde{y}_{i} . The Verifier evaluates this answer against the ground truth y i y_{i} . Upon detecting an error ( y ~ i \u2260 y i \\tilde{y}_{i}\\neq y_{i} ), the system activates the Generation process to update both memory banks in parallel, yielding \u2133 i + 1 L \\mathcal{M}^{L}_{i+1} and \u2133 i + 1 V \\mathcal{M}^{V}_{i+1} . This mechanism enables the agent to progressively refine its capabilities through iterative self-correction.\nCore Operations. We define several key operations used throughout the framework. Let \u03d5 T \u200b ( \u22c5 ) \\phi^{T}(\\cdot) and \u03d5 M \u200b ( \u22c5 ) \\phi^{M}(\\cdot) denote text and multimodal embedding functions, respectively. The cosine similarity between two embeddings is computed as:\nFor problem analysis during retrieval, we employ an LLM to extract structured information from the question and reasoning trace:\nThe process identifies the problem\u2019s subject domain and key concepts. An enriched query is then constructed by combining the original question with this analysis:\nWhen errors are detected, the system activates a parallel memory-generation framework, as illustrated in Figure 2 (b). This framework conducts detailed error attribution and constructs structured memory units corresponding to two distinct error types.\nThe visual analysis module, powered by an MLLM, simultaneously identifies the error type and generates corrective guidance. Given the original image I i I_{i} , question q i q_{i} , erroneous reasoning trace y ~ i \\tilde{y}_{i} , and ground truth y i y_{i} , the module produces both an error indicator and a corresponding guideline within a single model invocation, formally expressed as:\nwhere e i V \u2208 True , False e^{V}_{i}\\in{\\text{True},\\text{False}} indicates whether the error originates from visual misinterpretation (e.g., object confusion, overlooked visual symbols, or spatial relationship misunderstandings), and g i V g^{V}_{i} denotes the generated Visual Guideline \u2014an instruction prescribing the correct observation strategy. All information is stored in a structured JSON dictionary for persistent memory updating. For example, when addressing shape and attribution-related errors in 3D solid objects, the guideline may state:\n\u201cWhen an object has a uniform, reflective, or metallic-looking surface\u2014even if it appears matte under diffuse lighting\u2014treat it as metallic if it matches the visual style of other known metallic objects in the scene.\u201d\nBefore storage, a similarity check is performed against existing memories in \u2133 i V \\mathcal{M}^{V}_{i} using text embeddings. The system computes similarity scores s j V = Sim \u200b ( \u03d5 T \u200b ( g i V ) , \u03d5 T \u200b ( m j V ) ) s^{V}_{j}=\\text{Sim}(\\phi^{T}(g^{V}_{i}),\\phi^{T}(m^{V}_{j})) for all m j V \u2208 \u2133 i V m^{V}_{j}\\in\\mathcal{M}^{V}_{i} . If max j \u2061 s j V > \u03c4 V \\max_{j}s^{V}_{j}>\\tau^{V} (where \u03c4 V \\tau^{V} is a similarity threshold), a merge operation consolidates the knowledge:\nwhere j \u2217 = arg \u2061 max j \u2061 s j V j^{*}=\\arg\\max_{j}s^{V}_{j} . Otherwise, a new memory entry is created: \u2133 i + 1 V = \u2133 i V \u222a { ( g i V , I i ) } \\mathcal{M}^{V}_{i+1}=\\mathcal{M}^{V}_{i}\\cup\\{(g^{V}_{i},I_{i})\\} .\nIn parallel, the logic analysis module, powered by an LLM, examines the reasoning chain for non-visual errors such as computational mistakes, formula misapplications, or logical fallacies. This module focuses solely on textual reasoning without accessing visual information. As formalized in Equation\u00a0(6), the module produces both error classification and guideline in a single model invocation:\nwhere e i L \u2208 { Logical , Non-Logical } e^{L}_{i}\\in\\{\\text{Logical},\\text{Non-Logical}\\} classifies whether the error involves reasoning failures, and g i L g^{L}_{i} represents the abstracted Logic Guideline . The model outputs a structured text response containing error type, analysis summary, and guideline fields. For example, when encountering a geometry error arising from incorrect assumptions (i.e., textual biases), the generated guideline may state:\n\u201cIn geometry problems involving perpendicular bisectors, remember that only points lying on the perpendicular bisector segment are guaranteed to be equidistant from the endpoints of the segment. Do not assume a point lies on the bisector unless this is explicitly stated or can be proven from the given construction. Always verify the position of intersection points relative to the bisector before applying the equidistance property.\u201d\nThis guideline then undergoes the same similarity check and merge/create process as visual memory. Similarity scores s j L = Sim \u200b ( \u03d5 T \u200b ( g i L ) , \u03d5 T \u200b ( m j L ) ) s^{L}_{j}=\\text{Sim}(\\phi^{T}(g^{L}_{i}),\\phi^{T}(m^{L}_{j})) are computed for all m j L \u2208 \u2133 i L m^{L}_{j}\\in\\mathcal{M}^{L}_{i} , and the memory bank is updated accordingly:\nwhere j \u2217 = arg \u2061 max j \u2061 s j L j^{*}=\\arg\\max_{j}s^{L}_{j} , m new L = Merge L \u200b ( m j \u2217 L , g i L ) m^{L}_{\\text{new}}=\\text{Merge}^{L}(m^{L}_{j^{*}},g^{L}_{i}) , and the update is triggered when e i L = Logical e^{L}_{i}=\\text{Logical} and g i L \u2260 \u2205 g^{L}_{i}\\neq\\emptyset .\nWhen addressing a new problem x i = ( I i , q i ) x_{i}=(I_{i},q_{i}) , the solver initiates parallel retrieval procedures from both memory banks, as illustrated in Figure 2 (c). Unlike conventional single-stage retrieval, our framework employs specialized strategies for each memory type: visual memory uses a two-stage multimodal-to-text pipeline, while logical memory leverages problem analysis to construct enriched queries.\nVisual memory retrieval employs a two-stage pipeline that progressively refines candidates from visual similarity to semantic relevance.\nStage 1: Image Embedding Similarity. The system first employs multimodal embeddings to compute visual similarity between the query image I i I_{i} and all stored memory images. For each memory ( m j V , I j V ) \u2208 \u2133 i V (m^{V}_{j},I^{V}_{j})\\in\\mathcal{M}^{V}_{i} , the similarity is computed as s j M = Sim \u200b ( \u03d5 M \u200b ( I i ) , \u03d5 M \u200b ( I j V ) ) s^{M}_{j}=\\text{Sim}(\\phi^{M}(I_{i}),\\phi^{M}(I^{V}_{j})) . This rapidly recalls a set of top- k M k^{M} candidate memories:\nStage 2: Text Embedding Filtering . Visual similarity alone is insufficient for semantic matching. The system subsequently performs text-based reranking using the enriched query q ~ i \\tilde{q}_{i} from Equation\u00a0(3). For each candidate guideline m j V \u2208 \ud835\udc9e i V m^{V}_{j}\\in\\mathcal{C}^{V}_{i} , text similarity is computed as s j T = Sim \u200b ( \u03d5 T \u200b ( q ~ i ) , \u03d5 T \u200b ( m j V ) ) s^{T}_{j}=\\text{Sim}(\\phi^{T}(\\tilde{q}_{i}),\\phi^{T}(m^{V}_{j})) . The final retrieved visual memories are obtained by filtering with threshold \u03c4 V \\tau^{V} and selecting top- k V k^{V} by similarity score:\nThis two-stage process ensures that the retrieved visual memories are both semantically relevant to the current problem and specifically address common visual pitfalls encountered when interpreting similar images.\nFocusing on where to look via visual attention maps. Beyond textual guidelines, we further introduce an auxiliary visual representation of memory cues. Leveraging the retrieved visual memory and its associated error patterns, the system generates question-aware attention maps that highlight historically error-prone regions in the query image I i I_{i} . These attention maps serve as supplementary visual inputs alongside the original image, providing explicit spatial guidance that directs the model\u2019s focus toward task-relevant areas while avoiding known perceptual traps. Experimental results demonstrate that this visual augmentation yields additional performance improvements (refer to Section 4.4 ).\nLogical memory retrieval is a text-based semantic matching process. The system constructs an enriched query q ~ i \\tilde{q}_{i} using Equations 2 - 3 to capture both the problem text and structured domain information. For each memory m j L \u2208 \u2133 i L m^{L}_{j}\\in\\mathcal{M}^{L}_{i} , text embedding similarity is computed as s j L = Sim \u200b ( \u03d5 T \u200b ( q ~ i ) , \u03d5 T \u200b ( m j L ) ) s^{L}_{j}=\\text{Sim}(\\phi^{T}(\\tilde{q}_{i}),\\phi^{T}(m^{L}_{j})) . The top- k L k^{L} most relevant guidelines are retrieved by applying similarity threshold \u03c4 L \\tau^{L} and ranking by similarity score:\nFinally, the solver generates the answer by conditioning on both the original inputs and the retrieved memories from the visual and logical streams:\nwhere Gen denotes the MLLM solver that integrates visual perception, question understanding, and dual-stream memory guidance. The retrieved logical guidelines R i L R^{L}_{i} provide structured and context-relevant reasoning frameworks, while the visual guidelines R i V R^{V}_{i} supply explicit perceptual priors. Together, they enable more robust and accurate multimodal reasoning.",

To assess the effectiveness and generalizability of ViLoMem , we evaluate it across models of varying scale and accessibility: the proprietary GPT-4.1 as a strong closed-source baseline, the open-source Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct as a state-of-the-art large multimodal model, and Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct as a smaller model to test whether memory benefits extend to resource-constrained settings. For memory generation, we employ Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct for logical memory (pure language reasoning analysis) and Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct for visual memory (image-grounded error attribution). Memory retrieval uses Qwen3-Embedding for text similarity and Qwen2.5-VL-Embedding for image similarity, enabling efficient semantic matching. Additional implementation details are provided in the Appendix.\nEvaluation Metrics. We report pass@1 accuracy using VLMEvalKit [ vlmevalkit ] . When rule-based matching detects potential errors, we apply an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism for verification, enhancing scoring accuracy and reducing false negatives from format variations.\nTable 1 shows evaluations across six multimodal benchmarks covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination robustness, and visual knowledge understanding. We compare three MLLMs under three configurations: Baseline : following the official default prompting setup; Step : using explicit step-by-step reasoning prompts; and + ViLoMem : integrating our dual-stream memory framework.\nThe comparison between Step and + ViLoMem highlights the effectiveness of memory in mitigating de novo reasoning and promoting experience-driven problem solving.\nViLoMem achieves consistent improvements across all models, with particularly notable gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. This result aligns with our motivation, as mathematical reasoning tasks demand more visually grounded chains of thoughts. Prior studies have shown that visual perception errors significantly degrade reasoning accuracy [ zhang2025primitive , lu2021mathvista ] . By tracking visual errors and integrating them with logical reasoning, ViLoMem effectively enhances overall mathematical reasoning performance.\nAmong the three MLLMs, GPT-4.1 shows the largest improvement\u2014particularly on MathVision (+6.48) and MathVista (+2.61)\u2014owing to its stronger contextual learning ability and superior capacity to utilize and interpret past errors for solving similar problems. Smaller models benefit more substantially from memory augmentation: Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct achieves notable gains on MMMU (+4.38) and RealWorldQA (+2.74), indicating that structured memory provides complementary knowledge beyond the model\u2019s limited parametric capacity.\nAmong the evaluated tasks, improvements on knowledge-intensive benchmarks are moderate, as these tasks primarily rely on factual recall rather than multi-step reasoning. Moreover, manual inspection of the stored memory information from both streams reveals two primary performance bottlenecks. First, when the solver exhibits strong textual bias, over-relying on linguistic reasoning while paying limited attention to visual cues, the resulting reasoning traces contain insufficient visual information for the verifier to generate effective visual memory. Second, when the solver struggles to perceive complex diagrams and generates low-quality visual descriptions, the verifier finds it difficult to identify clear visual errors and tends to attribute all errors to the logical stream, often resulting in mixed memory updates. Therefore, a promising direction for future work is to design more specialized mechanisms to further enhance the decoupling the dual memory streams.\nFigure 3 illustrates the operation of dual-stream memory in practice. Cases 1, 2, and 4 expose a key limitation of logical memory: it retrieves guidelines irrelevant to the visual context (e.g., recalling perpendicular bisector principles when material discrimination is required). Visual memory effectively addresses this gap by identifying surface reflectivity (Case\u00a01), numerical digits in diagrams (Case\u00a02), and background luminance for color perception (Case\u00a04). The attention maps confirm that retrieved visual cues guide the model toward task-relevant regions (Case\u00a02/\u00a04). Case\u00a03 highlights the plausibility of our memory generation process: when a problem can be solved without visual cues (the question already providing complete visual descriptions), logical memory alone suffices. Overall, visual memory supports perception-intensive tasks, while logical memory governs reasoning-driven problems.\nWe validate the necessity of dual-stream memory by selectively disabling each component on GPT-4.1. As shown in Table 2 , removing either stream consistently degrades performance, confirming that both memory types are essential. Removing logical memory leads to larger drops on MathVista , where systematic reasoning and formula-related errors frequently recur. In contrast, removing visual memory produces comparable degradation across both benchmarks, indicating that visual distraction errors are pervasive in multimodal reasoning tasks. The gap between the single-stream variants and the full ViLoMem model demonstrates their complementarity: the visual and logical streams capture distinct, rather than redundant, error patterns. Augmenting visual memory with question-aware attention maps yields notable gains on MMMU, but only marginal improvements on MathVista, because diagram-based tasks require more fine-grained visual understanding, e.g., smaller-scale vertex attention and higher spatial precision. More detailed analyses are provided in the Appendix.\nFigure 4 analyzes memory usage patterns across all benchmarks. Visual memory generation dominates the error collection, accounting for 59%\u201393% of stored cases in Figure 4 (a), demonstrating that visual perception remains the primary bottleneck in multimodal reasoning. Despite this generation asymmetry, both streams contribute comparably during retrieval, indicating effective memory reuse. Figure 4 (b) further confirms consistent dual-stream coordination across all three MLLMs, as reflected by the distribution of translucent retrieval points along the diagonal, indicating balanced contributions from both visual and logical streams. Moreover, our memory mechanism is not biased toward any specific model, as all three models exhibit similar patterns of memory utilization.\nTo evaluate the reusability and composability of the dual-stream memory framework, we conduct cross-model memory transfer experiments where each solver retrieves memories generated by other models. As shown in Table 3 , the 8B model benefits most from cross-model memories (+1.36 on MMMU, +1.33 on MathVista), surpassing its self-generated performance, indicating that memories distilled from stronger models encode higher-quality error patterns and generalization strategies. In contrast, larger models show comparable or slightly reduced performance, as their reasoning capabilities already yield near-optimal memory formation. These results highlight that dual-stream memory supports effective knowledge distillation from stronger to weaker models, enabling collaborative learning without explicit fine-tuning or ensembling.\nWe assess memory transferability across task domains using Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct. For each target benchmark in Table 4 , we exclude its task-specific memory bank and instead retrieve from memories accumulated across all other benchmarks . The results reveal substantial heterogeneity: MathVision and RealWorldQA benefit from cross-domain memories, as both require strong spatial reasoning. In contrast, tasks with large domain gaps, such as MathVista and HallusionBench (diagram-grounded vs. natural image reasoning), exhibit conflicts in memory utilization. Overall, the persistent gap between cross-domain and ViLoMem underscores that task-aligned memories are essential for optimal performance, validating our design choice to maintain distinct memory banks for different domains.",

Inspired by human semantic memory systems, ViLoMem coordinates visual and logical memory streams through specialized retrieval strategies and grow-and-refine update mechanisms. Comprehensive evaluations across six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on mathematical reasoning tasks where visual-logical coupling is most acute. Ablation studies confirm that both memory streams are complementary; joint operation enables synergistic error correction. Further analyses reveal heterogeneous cross-domain transfer behavior\u2014task-aligned domains benefit from shared memory, whereas domain-mismatched tasks exhibit mild interference. Moreover, cross-model transfer experiments highlight that our memory can distill error patterns and reasoning strategies from stronger models to smaller ones, demonstrating its potential as a lightweight knowledge-sharing mechanism without explicit fine-tuning. By enabling progressive error reduction without catastrophic forgetting, ViLoMem builds a foundation for continual learning in multimodal reasoning.\nSupplementary Material",

        "paragraphs": "To verify the flexibility of ViLoMem , we extend our evaluation beyond the main experiments to recent reasoning-enhanced models, including GLM-4.1v [ vteam2025glm45vglm41vthinkingversatilemultimodal ] , InternVL3-38B [ zhu2025internvl3 ] , and Gemini 2.5 [ comanici2025gemini ] . As shown in Table 5 , ViLoMem demonstrates robust adaptability across different architecture designs and inference regimes, consistently improving performance over both baseline and step-by-step configurations. This pattern echoes our observations in the main paper that visual perception remains a dominant bottleneck for multimodal reasoning [ lu2021mathvista , zhang2025primitive ] and that decoupling visual distraction from logical hallucination yields complementary gains across tasks. Notably, models equipped with \u201cthinking\u201d or long-chain reasoning capabilities exhibit superior compatibility with the step-by-step format required for memory retrieval: their extended inference process allows for tighter integration of retrieved visual and logical guidelines into the reasoning chain, enabling them to correct potential errors before they propagate. These results suggest that ViLoMem is particularly well-suited to models with strong deliberative reasoning, while still offering consistent benefits to smaller or less capable solvers.\nTable 6 presents the ablation study of the attention mechanism. In general, the integration of attention maps yields consistent performance gains across hallucination and general reasoning benchmarks (e.g., HallusionBench, MMStar), corroborating the critical importance of visual memory in refining perceptual grounding. However, we observe a performance plateau or marginal decline on mathematics-centric datasets (MathVista and MathVision). We attribute this limitation to two primary factors: (1) Visualization Precision : Current attention visualization methods struggle to faithfully preserve fine-grained geometric structures and chart details, which are essential for mathematical reasoning. (2) Contextual Interpretation : While serving as an auxiliary image to enhance visual context, the attention map imposes higher demands on the model\u2019s intrinsic capability to interpret heatmap overlays. The benefit of this enriched context is contingent on the model\u2019s ability to align these explicit visual cues with the raw image features without information loss.\nFigure 5 summarizes representative qualitative cases. For many vision-intensive questions (e.g., traffic-light color, visible portion of the sun, object localization, and optical-illusion setups), logical memory is either not retrieved or fails to offer useful guidance, while visual memory provides concrete viewing strategies such as checking the actual illuminated region, reading tiny objects and relative positions from the viewer\u2019s frame, or isolating targets from distracting backgrounds. In these cases, attention maps concentrate on the queried regions (e.g., the active light, visible solar arc, or relevant segments), so that the retrieved visual guidelines directly steer the solver toward task-relevant evidence.\nFor geometry and chart-reading tasks, visual and logical memories are complementary: logical memory provides reusable rules for measurement and graph interpretation, while visual memory focuses on concrete inspection behaviors such as aligning with gridlines, following step edges, or checking true line orientation under strong illusions. Together, these cases highlight a clear division of labor: visual memory governs \u201cwhere to look\u201d and mitigates systematic perceptual traps, whereas logical memory refines \u201chow to reason\u201d once the correct visual evidence has been attended.\nWe benchmark ViLoMem against state-of-the-art memory mechanisms [ suzgun2025dynamic , zhang2025ace ] . While the original Dynamic-Cheetsheet [ suzgun2025dynamic ] employs cumulative memory, its unbounded context growth is infeasible for our large-scale setting (approx. 1,000 cases per benchmark), so we adopt the retrieval-based configuration from the open-source Dynamic-Cheetsheet codebase, which follows the similar methodology as ACE [ zhang2025ace ] . For a fair multimodal comparison, we replicate the official prompt structure and use the same MLLM for both memory generation and inference. In this setup, the retrieval module relies purely on text similarity without image-aware matching.\nExperimental results in Table 6 show that this direct adaptation of logical memory methods is suboptimal in multimodal settings and can even underperform the baseline, especially for smaller models. In practice, such text-only retrieval often surfaces visually dissimilar examples with similar questions, resurfacing prior misperceptions as salient \u201chints\u201d that misdirect attention away from the correct regions of the current problem. Qualitative inspection further reveals that Dynamic-Cheetsheet and ACE are tailored to code- or logic-centric schemas: even when driven by an MLLM, they mainly produce fine-grained corrections of specific visual details (digits, colors, marks) rather than robust guidance on how to inspect diagrams. These detail-level cues lack stable visual grounding and easily conflict with the actual image, inducing additional hallucinations that smaller models are particularly vulnerable to. This contrast highlights the need for ViLoMem \u2019s decoupled visual stream and question-aware retrieval, which explicitly organize and retrieve perception-oriented error patterns instead of repurposing logic-only memories.",

For open-source models, we deploy most checkpoints using vLLM for efficient batched inference.\nDue to its scale, Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct is accessed via its official API instead of local deployment, and all proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 flash) are evaluated through their corresponding APIs.\nFor API-based evaluations, certain images or prompts may be flagged as unsafe by the provider\u2019s safety filters and thus rejected, which introduces a small amount of noise into the reported scores.\nDecoding Hyperparameters. Unless otherwise specified, we use a temperature of 0.7 0.7 and a maximum generation length of 8 , 192 8{,}192 tokens for all models.\nWithin our memory pipeline, the maximum generation length is set to 1 , 024 1{,}024 tokens for problem analysis and 2 , 048 2{,}048 tokens for memory generation to balance expressiveness and efficiency.\nBaseline evaluations directly feed benchmark questions to the models without additional prompts, whereas the Step configuration prepends a simple step-by-step system prompt; the full template is shown in Figure 6 .\nAttention Map Generation. Attention maps are generated following the training-free small-detail perception framework of Zhang et al. [ zhangmllms ] , instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL-3B as the backbone model.\nThis setup produces token-level saliency over input images, which we overlay as heatmaps to visualize and interpret visual memory retrieval.\nEvaluation Protocol. We adopt VLMEvalKit [ vlmevalkit ] as the primary evaluation framework.\nWhen automatic matching fails or produces ambiguous results (e.g., due to formatting variations), we further apply Math-Verify and an LLM-as-a-judge protocol to reduce sensitivity to output formatting.\nThe judge model is Qwen3-8B-Instruct , which assesses whether a model\u2019s response is semantically correct with respect to the reference answer.",

        "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in scene understanding, visual question answering, and complex scientific problem solving [ bai2025qwen2 , wu2024deepseek , zhang2025abstractive , zhao2025efficient ] .",
        "Yet despite their growing capability, current MLLMs approach each problem de novo \u2014solving every query in isolation, repeatedly re-deriving the same insights and re-committing familiar errors [ fang2025comprehensive , zhang2025survey , gao2025survey , tan2025prospect ] .",
        "Although recent memory-augmented models attempt to mitigate this by storing past interactions [ suzgun2025dynamic , zhang2025ace ] , these memories capture only high-level logical summaries while discarding the visual grounding and perceptual cues essential for multimodal reasoning.",
        "Recent research has demonstrated that MLLMs\u2019 visual perception ability remains fundamentally weaker than their linguistic reasoning, with low-level perceptual failures identified as a primary bottleneck for high-level multimodal reasoning tasks [ lu2021mathvista , sun2025mathglance , tong2024eyes ] .",
        "In mathematical multimodal problem-solving in particular, diagram-perception errors exceed logical reasoning errors, and visual mistakes frequently persist in intermediate reasoning steps even when the final answer is correct [ zhang2025primitive ] .",
        "This indicates visual attention errors directly causedownstream logical hallucinations that creates a cascading failure pattern [ wu2024combating , zhou2025perception ] .",
        "Our ablation studies further confirm this phenomenon: across six multimodal problem-solving benchmarks, the proportion of visual error summaries consistently exceeds that of logical memory errors (Fig.",
        "Therefore, when solving problems paired with images, it isessential for models to maintain accurate visual attention to task-relevant regions, avoiding perceptual distractions that propagate into flawed logical inferences.",
        "Logic-only memory is insufficient for multimodal problem solving.",
        "While logical theorems and rules are general (e.g., applying the base\u2013height formula for area computation), effective reasoning also requires aligning these abstract rules with their correct visual counterparts (e.g., the shape of triangles).",
        "As illustrated in Fig.",
        "1 , triangles exhibit diverse visual configurations, and early attempts may contain both logical and visual errors.",
        "Through feedback, the model refines its logical memory for question-appropriate theorem application and its visual memory to avoid perceptual traps, attending to task-relevant regions.",
        "This progressive learning mirrors the human cognitive system, where semantic memory maintains multimodal representations that integrate visual experience with abstract reasoning [ jneuro2024multimodal ] .",
        "We thus introduce ViLoMem , a dual-stream memory framework that separately models visual distraction patterns and logical hallucination errors as structured schemas, coordinating them through unified retrieval.",
        "Following a grow-and-refine principle, ViLoMem avoids the detail erosion caused by iterative rewriting by filtering similar error patterns and using tailored add/skip and retrieval strategies to incrementally accumulate multimodal semantic knowledge.",
        "Specifically, we design custom retrieval strategies for visual and logical streams.",
        "For the visual stream, direct image-similarity search is insufficient; the key requirement is helping the model identify question-specific \u201cvisually trapped regions\u201d.",
        "To achieve question-aware attention, we generate cross-modal attention maps guided by keywords (previously observed visual mistakes), enabling the model to highlight regions associated with known error patterns relevant to the current question.",
        "For the logical stream, instead of directly retrieving query semantically similar logics, the model first analyzes the problem to identify its underlying subject and reasoning requirements\u2014supporting precise positioning of the task type and precise selection of the relevant logical schema.",
        "Overall, ViLoMem automatically attributes successes or failures to the visual or logical stream and updates the corresponding schemas without human supervision.",
        "It enables progressive mistake reduction and cross-domain knowledge transfer in multimodal tasks.",
        "Our contributions are summarized as follows:We propose ViLoMem , the first framework that explicitly separates visual distraction errors from logical hallucination errors , constructing a dual-stream memory inspired by multimodal semantic memory in the human cognitive system.",
        "ViLoMem employs a question-aware attention mask for visual images and a precise\u2010positioning \u2013 precise\u2010selection regime for logical retrieval, together with filtering-based memory update strategies to avoid detail erosion, enabling coordinated retrieval between visual cues and logical constraints.",
        "This directs attention to task-relevant regions while suppressing invalid logical inferences.",
        "Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy across diverse model scales, achieving substantial gains on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.48 on MathVision for GPT-4.1, +4.38 on MMMU for Qwen3-VL-8B).",

        "While the original Dynamic-Cheetsheet [ suzgun2025dynamic ] employs cumulative memory, its unbounded context growth is infeasible for our large-scale setting (approx.",
        "1,000 cases per benchmark), so we adopt the retrieval-based configuration from the open-source Dynamic-Cheetsheet codebase, which follows the similar methodology as ACE [ zhang2025ace ] .",
        "For a fair multimodal comparison, we replicate the official prompt structure and use the same MLLM for both memory generation and inference.",
        "In this setup, the retrieval module relies purely on text similarity without image-aware matching.",
        "Experimental results in Table 6 show that this direct adaptation of logical memory methods is suboptimal in multimodal settings and can even underperform the baseline, especially for smaller models.",
        "In practice, such text-only retrieval often surfaces visually dissimilar examples with similar questions, resurfacing prior misperceptions as salient \u201chints\u201d that misdirect attention away from the correct regions of the current problem.",
        "Qualitative inspection further reveals that Dynamic-Cheetsheet and ACE are tailored to code- or logic-centric schemas: even when driven by an MLLM, they mainly produce fine-grained corrections of specific visual details (digits, colors, marks) rather than robust guidance on how to inspect diagrams.",
        "These detail-level cues lack stable visual grounding and easily conflict with the actual image, inducing additional hallucinations that smaller models are particularly vulnerable to.",
        "This contrast highlights the need for ViLoMem \u2019s decoupled visual stream and question-aware retrieval, which explicitly organize and retrieve perception-oriented error patterns instead of repurposing logic-only memories.",
        "This section provides additional implementation details that complement the experimental setup.",
        "Model Deployment.",
        "For open-source models, we deploy most checkpoints using vLLM for efficient batched inference.",
        "Due to its scale, Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct is accessed via its official API instead of local deployment, and all proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 flash) are evaluated through their corresponding APIs.",
        "For API-based evaluations, certain images or prompts may be flagged as unsafe by the provider\u2019s safety filters and thus rejected, which introduces a small amount of noise into the reported scores.",
        "Decoding Hyperparameters.",
        "Unless otherwise specified, we use a temperature of 0.7 0.7 and a maximum generation length of 8 , 192 8{,}192 tokens for all models.",
        "Within our memory pipeline, the maximum generation length is set to 1 , 024 1{,}024 tokens for problem analysis and 2 , 048 2{,}048 tokens for memory generation to balance expressiveness and efficiency.",
        "Baseline evaluations directly feed benchmark questions to the models without additional prompts, whereas the Step configuration prepends a simple step-by-step system prompt; the full template is shown in Figure 6 .",
        "Attention Map Generation.",

        "We adopt VLMEvalKit [ vlmevalkit ] as the primary evaluation framework.",
        "When automatic matching fails or produces ambiguous results (e.g., due to formatting variations), we further apply Math-Verify and an LLM-as-a-judge protocol to reduce sensitivity to output formatting.",

Problem Formulation. Tasks and Datasets. We evaluate ViLoMem on three multimodal reasoning benchmarks that are particularly sensitive to cumulative visual\u2013logical errors:\n(1) Hallucination and real-world robustness , which emphasize language hallucination, visual illusion, and spatial grounding;\n(2) Multimodal mathematical reasoning , which couples logic reasoning with visual grounding; and\n(3) Vision-dependent knowledge , which requires expert-level visual understanding across multiple disciplines. We introduce ViLoMem , a dual-stream memory framework that separately models visual distraction patterns and logical hallucination errors for multimodal large language models. Inspired by human semantic memory systems, ViLoMem coordinates visual and logical memory streams through specialized retrieval strategies and grow-and-refine update mechanisms. To verify the flexibility of ViLoMem , we extend our evaluation beyond the main experiments to recent reasoning-enhanced models, including GLM-4.1v [ vteam2025glm45vglm41vthinkingversatilemultimodal ] , InternVL3-38B [ zhu2025internvl3 ] , and Gemini 2.5 [ comanici2025gemini ] . As shown in Table 5 , ViLoMem demonstrates robust adaptability across different architecture designs and inference regimes, consistently improving performance over both baseline and step-by-step configurations. This section provides additional implementation details that complement the experimental setup. Model Deployment. We provide the full prompt templates used in our framework, including the step-by-step reasoning prompt used in the Step configuration (Figure 6 ), the Problem Analysis Prompt (Figure 7 ), the Logical Memory Generation Prompt (Figure 8 ), and the Visual Memory Generation Prompt (Figure 9 ), together with the LLM-as-a-judge verification prompt (Figure 10 )."

        "paragraphs": "The focus in system dynamics (SD) is on understanding the dynamic behavior of systems from an endogenous or feedback perspective through the use of computer simulation of systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (Richardson, 2011). Understanding the dynamics of systems in SD emphasizes developing an explicit explanation of the structure-behavior relationship in a system, that is, understanding how the dynamics of a system are generated by a set of interacting nonlinear balancing and reinforcing feedback mechanisms. With advances in implementing formal methods of loop dominance analysis in recent years, this structure-behavior relationship can now be more systematically and rigorously studied by determining the patterns of dominance of feedback mechanisms, which opens up new areas for both theoretical and applied research in understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems.\nSystem dynamics has also gained interest among data scientists and engineers seeking to advance more responsible AI/ML applications. For example, Ruha Benjamin (2019) sees system dynamics as a potential way to mitigate the biases that appear in AI/ML applications due to incomplete causal knowledge of the societal context by engaging and involving communities in conceptualizing systems using participatory methods. Researchers at Google Research have also been exploring and motivating the application of system dynamics for better understanding societal context of AI/ML (Kuhlberg et al 2023; Martin & Moore, 2020). Most recently, for example, Martin and Kinney (2024) have focused on demonstrating how the inclusion of feedback loops can help reduce the epistemic uncertainty of AI/ML models. However, these efforts have largely focused on comparing the predictive performance of AI/ML models that include feedback loops as opposed to leveraging the deeper structure-behavior relationship of feedback mechanisms. From a system dynamics perspective, a particular concern has been the difficulty of effectively communicating nonlinear feedback effects involving accumulations to data scientists and statistically oriented fields. Some of the confusion stems from differences in the diagramming conventions, but also more fundamentally in not having a common mathematical framework for comparing methods. While this could be attributed to differences in the underlying assumptions, training, and practices as Donella Meadows described as the \u201cunavoidable a priori\u201d in her 1976 conference paper, the various methods are grounded in mathematics and hence can be resolved to create a bridge for better multi- and trans-disciplinary collaborations. To address this gap, Meadows called for more frequently revisiting our underlying assumptions and comparing methods.\nSuch situations are not unique nor new, and efforts to formalize the relationship between different approaches can yield interesting results and applications. For example, there was a long-standing dispute in statistics about the comparability of results between analysis of variance and multiple regression with the resolution eventually leading to the general linear models we rely on today. In another example, path analysis and partial regression analysis ultimately developed into the LISREL model that integrates latent causal modeling and measurement models to form the basis of modern structural equation modeling (Bollen, 1989).\nSystem dynamicists often shy away from learning and using advanced statistical methods such as structural equation modeling. This is unfortunate because methods such as SEM can help identify the longitudinal patterns that form the basis of reference modes, establish measures for intangible or \u201csoft\u201d variables, empirically inform some of the causal relationships in our models, and provide additional tools for empirically testing and building confidence in our models and simulation results. This has led to exclusion of intangible variables from models even when they are known to play a critical role in judgement and decision making, reference modes not being appropriately grounded in data, the use of partial regression estimates to inform causal structure, and a tendency to rely on statistical associations to inform model formulation instead of operational thinking skills.\nHowever, acquiring the statistical training to incorporate methods such as structural equation modeling is often outside the scope of most programs, and statistical courses usually begin with a fundamentally different set of assumption leaving it up to the novice student to figure out the underlying relationships. This is usually fraught with conceptual challenges where it may be difficult to distinguish what a novice does not yet know about a method from true conceptual differences. But, the barriers are not limited to the novice learner or student. Even among established experts, the very experience of looking at a system through dynamics and feedback loops or from the perspective of answering a research question given some data leads to deeply ingrained patterns of thought.\nWhile the mental habits may keep us locked in the \u201cunavoidable a priori\u201d, these methods are mathematical in their description and use. Mathematics is a powerful tool for exploring and translating ideas in ways that break us out of our patterns of thought. The similarity of these methods suggests that bridging these different views is more of a problem with mathematical description than some grand unifying theory or discovery. Hence, this paper is about developing and proposing a mathematical framework that covers both system dynamics and structural equation modeling.\nFor the field of system dynamics, a mathematical framework in common with related methods would help system dynamicists better integrate advanced statistical tools into system dynamics modeling. For data scientists and engineers, particularly those working to incorporate system dynamics into AI/ML applications, a common mathematical framework would help data scientists more appropriately and effecttively use results from system dynamics studies to advance statistical methods and applications. In this paper, we focus specifically on developing a mathematical framework bridging system dynamics and structural equation modeling (e.g., Bollen, 1989; Gunzler, Perzynksi, and Carle, 2021; Pearl, 2009; Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018).\nMore generally, causal modeling plays a central role in data science and AI/ML applications that inform the evidence-based interventions, practices, and policies that impact our world from medicine and education to economics and the environment. When the research that informs the development of new products and clinical interventions, for example, excludes theories of systemic causation (Bunge, 1997) as explanations, not only are we likely to misinterpret the effectiveness of interventions and attribute systemic causation (powell,2008) to statistical \u201cnuisance\u201d terms, but find ourselves caught in hopeless capability trap of not being able to understand our dynamically complex and changing world at a time when we have the greatest need to understand and apply systems science.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, the background provides a brief history of structural equation modeling as it relates to this paper, prior efforts to link SD and SEM, and efforts to develop a unified framework for simulation models. Next, we provide an overview of our approach to developing a general model, which begins by addressing some preliminary differences between SD and SEM. We then develop set of conventions and general mathematical framework to include SEM models. We then provides several examples of SD and SEM models using this general framework, and close with a discussion of some of the limitations, next steps, and implications.",

        "paragraphs": "In this section, we provide a brief history of SEM and relevant threads of prior work to develop a general framework for simulation modeling. We then discuss several conceptual barriers that have arguably contributed to the difficulties of bridging SD and SEM research and the unavoidable a prior.\nStructural equation modeling (SEM) brings together two main components, a structural latent causal model and a measurement model, from factor analysis and path analysis in statistics. Charles Spearman (1904) is credited with constructing the first factor model, which laid the foundations for measuring latent variables (Spearman, 1904; Tarka, 2018). In his work, he proposed a general ability factor, which he called g, that influences performance on disparate cognitive ability measures (Tarka, 2018). Sewell Wright (1918), a geneticist, was the originator of path analysis (Wright, 1921). In his work, he laid out an analytical strategy for imposing a causal structure to describing causal relationships between measures, and developed path diagrams to graphically depict the relationships between measures in these analyses (Tarka, 2018). Following these origins, SEM has grown due to social scientists and other academics looking to understand the structure of latent phenomena and relationships amongst latent and observed phenomena (Tarka, 2018). As latent variable models have become more complex, the advancement of latent variable software such as MPlus (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2012) has played a prominent role in the accessibility of SEM.\nPrior efforts to link system dynamics modeling involving systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with structural equation modeling work by Hovmand (2003) and Hovmand and Chalise (2015), however, these efforts were targeted to address more specific questions and limited to illustrative examples as opposed to a general framework. Related work outside system dynamics has mostly focused on trying to estimate parameters in ordinary differential equation models as dynamical systems using nonlinear regression (e.g., Archontoulis and Miguez, 2015) and structural equation modeling (e.g., Boker and Wenger, 2007). However, these methods largly focus on estimating parameters using the solution to a system of differential equations as opposed to the underlying causal structure. Levine et al\u2019s (1992) effort to trace the effects of perturbation through path analysis with feedback loops is an approach similar to the popular MITRE Corporation\u2019s Loopy (2021) online tool, however, both do this without accumulations which can lead to misleading inferences on the dynamic behavior of conserved systems.\nSchweppe\u2019s (1973) work on uncertain dynamic systems provides a general approach uncertain dynamic systems including both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives, static and dynamic systems, discrete and continuous time systems, and linear and nonlinear systems. Schweppe\u2019s mathematical framework considers these as a Bayesian linear model with 16 extensions and special cases. However, Schweppe\u2019s focus is more on the general estimation problem in uncertain dynamic systems as opposed to seeking to build a bridge between system dynamics and structural equation modeling as methods for representing causal systems.\nThere have also been efforts to unify approaches to computer simulation modeling. For example, Zeigler (1976) presented a general mathematical framework for different types of computer simulation modeling, e.g., discrete event simulation, continuous time simulation, etc. And, several software packages integrate different modeling paradigms, the most notable effort in system dynamics being AnyLogic which support system dynamics simulation modeling, discrete event simulation, and agent based modeling within the same integrated platform. These efforts focus mostly on the implementation of computer simulation as an applied mathematics or computer science problem and make contributions to the development of simulation software, but do not provide the general mathematical framework for understanding systems using system dynamics or structural equation modeling. That is, these efforts help address some of the divisions between approaches to computational modeling, but not the larger divide between computational modeling and statistical modeling.\nOur approach is to develop a common mathematical framework for bridging system dynamics (SD) modeling as a method with structural equation modeling (SEM). To do this, we first deal with conceptual barriers in interdisciplinary collaborations between SD and SEM. Table 1 provides a summary of conceptual differences between SD and SEM features, which will elaborated on in the next section as preliminary concepts before presenting our general framework. These differences are issues we will need to address in developing our general framework.\nTable 1. Summary of conceptual differences between SD and SEM\nIt is important to note, first, that the way we resolve these is to develop a common mathematical framework as opposed to the most parsimonious way of describing either method alone. Second, we focus on a common framework that generally covers the usual models from SD and SEM as opposed to a creative way that a method can be embedded within another. For example, system dynamics simulation software can be used to simulate a discrete set of observations and generate results that appear similar to the observed covariance matrices that form the basis of structural equation modeling. While such tricks may satisfy a specific application, they do not provide a general mathematical framework nor lead to a better understanding of how the two approaches are related.\nIn SD, the primary goal is to develop an explanation for a dynamic behavior pattern of interest that is usually represented as a behavior over time graph and often referred to as the reference mode. In contrast, the primary goal of SEM is to estimate the effects and predict an observed covariance matrix from the implied covariance matrix of a causal model.\nDifferences between the goals of the two methods arguably sit within a broader context of concerns about scientific methods, especially as this applies to social systems where the ontology of socially constructed systems (Berger and Luckmann, 1966) requires a scientific strategy that places a greater emphasis on theory appraisal before committing to statistical tests of propositions (Lakatos, 1970; Meehl, 1990).\nSD is essentially about solving the inverse problem of finding a plausible system of feedback mechanisms that can generate the dynamic behavior pattern being studied and the associated parameters of a model whereas SEM is primarily about solving the forward problem of predicting the effects from a given model.\nThe distinction between solving the forward problem versus the inverse problem is nontrivial. In the forward problem, the goal is to predict a response variable based on a model of predictor variables. For example, in y = a + b \u22c5 x y=a+b\\cdot x , y y is the response variable, and x x is the predictor variable with a a and b b constants. This can be simplified into a functional description as y = f \u200b ( x , a , b ) y=f(x,a,b) . When focused on inverse problems, the goal is fundamentally different where we want to find the function f f where y = f \u200b ( x , a , b ) y=f(x,a,b) . That is, we are less concerned with how well our identified function f f that maps ( x , a , b ) (x,a,b) onto y y fits, and more interested in which functions, if any, could do this.\nConfusion often arises in interdisciplinary conversations trying to understand SD results when people ask how the parameters or strength of the effects in causal relationships are determined. From the perspective of SD, there are lots of ways to assign a value to a parameter or causal relationship in a system dynamics model including grounding parameters empirically using a range of mixed methods. (i.e., from Delphi methods with experts to numerical estimates derived from meta-analysis) and stating Bayesian priors. However, the question is often misplaced because SD is focused on solving the inverse problem of finding plausible systems of differential equations and parameters that could explain the dynamics of the reference mode, not the forward problem of estimating the parameters and the effects of a model, which is often the primary concern in areas such epidemiology and biostatistics.\nWhat we ultimately want to do is show these two methods of solving the inverse problem and forward problem are complementary, not an either/or, and understanding this is essential for gaining a better grasp of the complexity of social systems for developing and sustaining a strong progressive program of research (Lakatos, 1970).\nSystem dynamics is essentially about finding a set of causal feedback relationships that can generate a given behavior pattern of interest, that is, solving the inverse problem as opposed to the forward problem of predicting what will happen given a set of causal relationships. System dynamics models are typically represented as either a causal loop diagram or a stock and flow diagram (Figures 1a and 1b) whereas structural equation models use path diagrams (Figure 1c). Although appearing similar, the conventions differ. For example, system dynamics models focus on identifying the set of balancing and reinforcing loops with loop labels using a B prefix for balancing loops and R prefix for reinforcing loops, whereas structural equation models generally do not even include explicit labels for feedback when they appear as cycles or non-recursive relationships as shown in Figure 1c.\nMore significant is the fact that structural equation models make an explicit distinction between (1) latent or unobserved variables as circles or ovals and (2) indicators or observed variables as rectangles (Figure 1c). In system dynamics, the main distinction is between stocks and flows, as shown in a stock and flow diagram (Figure 1b) where rectangles represent accumulations or stocks, and circles represent converters that include rates of change or flows (shown in Figure 1b with a value), endogenous variables, and exogenous variables and constant parameters. Causal loop diagrams generally do not make a visual distinction between stocks and flows and therefore drop the use of circles and rectangles altogether.\nSystem dynamics explicitly call out exogenous parameters in a model, e.g., \u03b2 \u200b 1 \\beta 1 and \u03b2 \u200b 2 \\beta 2 in Figures 1a and 1b, however, structural equation models generally do not because these are to be estimated by fitting the specified model to data. Meanwhile, standard structural equation models will generally include not only the indicators ( X \u200b 1 X1 , X \u200b 2 X2 , X \u200b 3 X3 , and X \u200b 4 X4 ) and their corresponding error terms in the measurement model ( \u03b5 \u200b 1 \\varepsilon 1 , \u03b5 \u200b 2 \\varepsilon 2 , \u03b5 \u200b 3 \\varepsilon 3 , and \u03b5 \u200b 4 \\varepsilon 4 ) (Figure 1c). 1 1 1 Note that extensions of the standard SEM model allow for error terms to be correlated.\nAdding to the confusion is that the relationship between causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and stock and flow diagrams (SFDs) in system dynamics is often ambiguous when going from a CLD to an SFD, but exact when going from an SFD to a CLD because CLDs are often conceptualized without explicitly identifying the accumulations and their corresponding flows. Figure 1a comes from drawing the CLD based on the SFD shown in Figure 1b. However, there are often numerous ways to translate a CLD into a SFD (Figure 1a being an exception by explicitly identifying the rate of change as d \u200b X dX for the variable X X which would imply that X X is an accumulation or stock variable).\nThe ambiguity of CLDs concerning their translation into SFDs leads some to caution against their use in system dynamics because they contribute to errors in conceptualizing systems and interpreting the behavior of systems (Richardson, 1997). Nonetheless, CLDs remain a popular choice in systems thinking because the diagramming conventions are often seen as easier to learn and use, especially when the goal is not to develop a formal system dynamics computer simulation model. Moreover, their similarity to the causal structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and latent causal structures in path diagrams have encouraged statisticians and more recently data scientists to view CLDs as an extension of DAGs, usually without recognizing some of their limitations and appreciating the significance of accumulations in feedback systems.\nWe will need to address these differences in formulating a general SD-SEM framework by defining a set of diagramming conventions that highlight the homomorphism of symbols between the two approaches. To do this, we will ultimately show an SD and SEM version of each system for each of the subsequent examples in hopes that this will enable readers trained in one approach to follow the argument and see the connection to the other approach.\nSystem dynamics and structural equation modeling deal with two entirely different sets of equations. System dynamics builds on a framework of nonlinear differential equations, which have an causal system represented by a system of differential equations, and an analytic or numerically approximated solution using computer simulation. Structural equation modeling uses a system of linear equations to represent the causal system and measurement model, which can be generalized to include nonlinear interaction terms, and an implied covariance matrix. Confusions arise between structural equation modeling and system dynamics modeling because people tend to either (1) associate the causal system of differential equations in SD with the linear equations representing the latent causal structure in SEM, or (2) associate the solution to the system of differential equations in SD with implied covariance matrix in SEM. The next two subsections aim to make this distinction more explicit.\nSD models consist of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are specified as a set of integral equations representing causal relationships in the system: 2 2 2 The symbol \u222b t 0 t \\int_{t_{0}}^{t} is the integral from t 0 t_{0} to time t t . To avoid confusion between the time t t that we are integrating to and the time we are integrating over between t 0 t_{0} to time t t , we follow the convention of u u and d \u200b u du as dummy variables for t t .\nwhere \ud835\udc99 \u200b ( \ud835\udc95 ) \\bm{x(t)} is a vector of state variables or stocks, \ud835\udc99 \u200b ( \ud835\udc95 ) = ( x 1 \u200b ( t ) , \u2026 , x k \u200b ( t ) ) \\bm{x(t)}=(x_{1}(t),...,x_{k}(t)) at time t t , where we use lowercase Roman bold font for vectors. The function f f is a vector of rates of change or flows in the system, which is a function of the vector of stock variables, \ud835\udc99 \u200b ( \ud835\udc95 ) \\bm{x(t)} , and a vector of constants \ud835\udc84 = ( c 1 , \u2026 , c j ) \\bm{c}=(c_{1},...,c_{j}) . The initial values of the stocks at t 0 t_{0} are defined by the vector \ud835\udc99 \ud835\udc95 \ud835\udfce = ( x 1 \u200b ( t 0 ) , \u2026 , x k \u200b ( t 0 ) ) \\bm{x_{t_{0}}}=(x_{1}(t_{0}),...,x_{k}(t_{0})) .\nWhen a system of integral equations is used to describe a causal system and its behavior, there are essentially two different sets of equations involved: (a) the system of differential equations representing the causal system as rate equations, and (b) the solution to the system of integral equations as shown below.\nFor linear systems of ordinary differential equations, we can generally find a solution to a given system. For example, in a population model where births, b \u200b i \u200b r \u200b t \u200b h \u200b s \u200b ( t ) births(t) are proportional to the size of the population, p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) pop(t) , we have, b \u200b i \u200b r \u200b t \u200b h \u200b s \u200b ( t ) = c \u22c5 p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) births(t)=c\\cdot pop(t) where c c represents a constant, i.e., fractional birth rate. This is the causal system for this simple linear model, which has the following solution:\nHence,\nEquation (1) is the causal system relating population size to birth rate, and equation (2) is the solution to (1) where population, p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) pop(t) , is the behavior of the system over time t t and a function of the constant c c and initial population p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t 0 ) pop(t_{0}) at t 0 t_{0} . If we can analytically solve (1) to find (2), then we can use data to estimate the parameter c c with a nonlinear regression and draw inferences about how a change in c c or the initial value p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t 0 ) pop(t_{0}) affects the behavior over time of p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) pop(t) .\nHowever, methods for finding analytic solutions of the form (2) are generally only available for systems of linear ordinary differential equations and special cases of nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. System dynamics is primarily concerned with systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations where a common approach is to solve the system of equations through numerical. integration methods. That is, in system dynamics, we find a numerical approximation of the solution (2) by simulating equation (1) over time. On the occassions when an analytic solution is available, we can compare the analytic solution (2), which is exact, against our numerically approximated solution from simulation to evaluate the performance of the numerical approximation.\nThis distinction becomes important when considering the differences because there are approaches in SEM to modeling dynamical systems that rely on estimating coefficients of an underlying causal system from data for where the analytic solutions are already known. This usually entails assuming a simple mathematical causal description of a system based on known mathematical models from biology or physics, e.g., population growth, oscillating pendulum, and seeking find mechanisms in the real system of interest that correspond to simple biological or physical mechanisms. There can be many situations where this is convenient and makes sense scientifically, but it is fundamentally different from the exercise in system dynamics of building up a causal system based on operational knowledge of the system and other known or hypothesized mechanisms (e.g., from scientific literature, interviews, group model building).\nStuctural equation modeling builds on the idea of representing a system as a set of relationships between a vector endogenous latent variables \ud835\udf3c = ( \u03b7 1 , \u2026 , \u03b7 m ) \\bm{\\eta}=(\\eta_{1},...,\\eta_{m}) measured by a vector observed variables \ud835\udc9a = ( y 1 , \u2026 , y p ) \\bm{y}=(y_{1},...,y_{p}) ,, and a vector of exogenous latent variables \ud835\udf43 = ( \u03be 1 , \u2026 , \u03be n ) \\bm{\\xi}=(\\xi_{1},...,\\xi_{n}) measured by a vector of observed variables \ud835\udc99 = ( x 1 , \u2026 , x q ) \\bm{x}=(x_{1},...,x_{q}) (Gunzler, Perzynksi, Carle, 2021). The relationships are described in the LISREL matrix form as structural model and measurement model .\nThe latent causal model is defined as,\nwhere \u03b1 \u03b7 = ( \u03b1 1 , \u2026 , \u03b1 m ) \\mathbf{\\alpha}_{\\eta}=(\\alpha_{1},...,\\alpha_{m}) , B \\mathrm{B} is a m \u00d7 m m\\times m matrix of slopes relating the endogenous latent variables, and \u0393 \\Gamma is a m \u00d7 n m\\times n matrix of slopes related endogenous to exogenous latent variables, and \u03b6 \\mathbf{\\zeta} is a vector of random error terms, \u03b6 = ( \u03b6 1 , \u2026 , \u03b6 m ) \\mathbf{\\zeta}=(\\zeta_{1},...,\\zeta_{m}) .\nThe measurement model is then defined as,\nwhere \ud835\udf42 y \\bm{\\nu}_{y} and \ud835\udf42 x \\bm{\\nu}_{x} are vectors representing intercepts for \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} and \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} respectively, \ud835\udeb2 y \\bm{\\Lambda}_{y} and \ud835\udeb2 x \\bm{\\Lambda}_{x} represent matrices of slopes or factor loadings for \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} and \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} respectively, and \u03f5 \\bm{\\epsilon} and \ud835\udf39 \\bm{\\delta} are vectors representing measurement errors for \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} and \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} respectively.\nMatrix equations (3) and (4) form the basis for calculating an implied covariance matrix \u2211 ( \ud835\udc7a ) \\bm{\\sum(S)} from parameters \ud835\udc7a \\bm{S} that can be compared against the observed covariance matrix \u2211 \\bm{\\sum} . Restrictions arise in SEM from the assumptions required to calculate the implied covariance matrix from (3) and (4). Extensions to (3) and (4) allow for the inclusion of nonlinear terms such as a polynomials and interactions between two latent variables.\nThe term \u2018dynamic\u2019 takes on different meanings in system dynamics and structural equation modeling. In structural equation modeling, particularly dynamic structural equation modeling, the term \u2018dynamic\u2019 means change over time, e.g., in longitudinal and time series patterns. However, in system dynamics, the term \u2018dynamic\u2019 refers not specifically to the behavior of a system changing over time, but the formal mathematical distinction between a static versus a dynamic system (see, for example, Palm 1983). In a static system , the output of a system y \u200b ( t ) y(t) is strictly a function of the input x \u200b ( t ) x(t) , i.e., y \u200b ( t ) = f \u200b ( x \u200b ( t ) ) y(t)=f(x(t)) . In a dynamic system , the output is a function of both the input and the state of the system, i.e., y \u200b ( t ) = f \u200b ( x \u200b ( t ) , y \u200b ( t ) ) y(t)=f(x(t),y(t)) . That is, what differentiates a static and dynamic system is not whether the output is changing over time, but whether how the output changes with the input. Consider an example of turning a light on and off, one and off. As soon as the input stabilizes, the output is stable (the light is either on or off). The light switch and light in this example represent a static system.\nThat is not true in a dynamic system. Consider an example of central heating and cooling in a building where one increases the desired temperature relative to some outside temperature with the expectation that the indoor temperature will rise to match the desired temperature. Once the desired temperature is set and assuming the outdoor temperature also remains constant, the indoor temperature will continue to change toward the desired temperature even though the inputs are stable.\nThe distinction between static and dynamic systems is something we will leverage in formulating our general SD-SEM framework and use to show how the general SEM framework maps into the static portion of a system dynamics model.\nBoth system dynamics and structural equation modeling generally assume that the underlying variables of the causal system are continuous, although there are ways to extend both to allow for discrete values. However, system dynamics and structural equation modeling differ in how variables are viewed over time.\nStructural equation modeling builds on a set of finite observations, which are discrete. System dynamics models simulate a continuous system over time, which is in contrast to discrete event simulation and agent based modeling, which simulate a system in discrete events. The continuous time perspective often gets confused with the discrete time approximation of a continuous system, so that people often make the mistake of assuming that the discrete time-step ( D \u200b T DT or \u0394 \u200b T \\Delta T ) of numerical integration used to calculate an approximate solution to the continuous time system should be the same as the observation times. That is, if there 10 observations of the real system, then the system dynamics model should be simulated in 10 time steps.\nThis confusion gets compounded when longitudinal observations are recorded and analyzed by their position in a longitudinal sequence (i.e., y 1 , y 2 , \u2026 , y k y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{k} ) as opposed to their actual time of data collection (i.e., y \u200b ( t 1 ) , y \u200b ( t 2 ) , \u2026 , y \u200b ( t k ) y(t_{1}),y(t_{2}),...,y(t_{k}) ). Varying differences between the actual time of observation, i.e., t 2 \u2212 t 1 , t 3 \u2212 t 2 , \u2026 , t k \u2212 t k \u2212 1 t_{2}-t_{1},t_{3}-t_{2},...,t_{k}-t_{k-1} , can lead to distortions in the shape or behavior modes of a curve, especially when the sampling period is large relative to the time constants in a system dynamics model.\nThis has implications for how we handle measurement error in developing a general framework because we need to consider both the measurement error associated with the value and time when bringing discrete observations into a measurement model for system dynamics.\nApproaches to measures of fit between models and observations differ considerably between system dynamics and structural equation modeling both in their respective practices and development. Whereas structural equation modeling has placed a strong emphasis on developing and critically using both global and local measures of fit along with standard reporting guidelines that emphasize multiple measures versus relying on a single measure, system dynamics has not. For example, despite an insistence by Sterman (2000) to provide an assessment of fit and decompose the error using Theil inequality statistics, most published system dynamics models still do not report as a matter of standard practice their fit with observed reference modes.\nWhile this might be attributed to differences between the underlying goal of modeling in system dynamics and structural equation modeling and greater reliance on measures of fit in structural equation modeling for selecting and refining models, there is essentially no excuse in system dynamics for not providing model assessments of fit even if these are known to be weak confidence building tests.\nWe will return to measures in fit as the general model we propose allows for drawing on work in structural equation modeling and specifically, ways to leverage the newer methods in system dynamics for predicting link and loop scores as a basis for formulating structural equation models that solve the forward problem of prediction.\nSD models are inherently under-determined, meaning that no set of observations will uniquely identify the system dynamics model and parameters. There is, in fact, an infinite set of models and parameters to consider. However, SD does not rely on numeric data alone to identify a model and recognizes that in social systems, people are also actors and observers of systems and hence have subjective qualitative knowledge about the structure of the system and decision rules within the bounded rationality of experience (e.g., Forrester, 1980; Sterman, 2000). SD models in this sense are not uniquely identified in the numeric sense, but given that the goal is to solve the inverse problem, that is also not critical.\nThe focus on solving the forward problem in SEM means the model needs to be identifiable, and hence models in SEM need to be identifiable in their specification, which emphasizes developing and using heuristics such as the minimum number of indicators per latent variables and concerns about the number of observations where models in SEM may be uniquely determined or overdetermined.",

Charles Spearman (1904) is credited with constructing the first factor model, which laid the foundations for measuring latent variables (Spearman, 1904; Tarka, 2018). In his work, he proposed a general ability factor, which he called g, that influences performance on disparate cognitive ability measures (Tarka, 2018). Sewell Wright (1918), a geneticist, was the originator of path analysis (Wright, 1921). In his work, he laid out an analytical strategy for imposing a causal structure to describing causal relationships between measures, and developed path diagrams to graphically depict the relationships between measures in these analyses (Tarka, 2018). Following these origins, SEM has grown due to social scientists and other academics looking to understand the structure of latent phenomena and relationships amongst latent and observed phenomena (Tarka, 2018). As latent variable models have become more complex, the advancement of latent variable software such as MPlus (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2012) has played a prominent role in the accessibility of SEM.",

Related work outside system dynamics has mostly focused on trying to estimate parameters in ordinary differential equation models as dynamical systems using nonlinear regression (e.g., Archontoulis and Miguez, 2015) and structural equation modeling (e.g., Boker and Wenger, 2007).

            "title": "2.4 Differences between SD and SEM",
            "paragraphs": "Our approach is to develop a common mathematical framework for bridging system dynamics (SD) modeling as a method with structural equation modeling (SEM). To do this, we first deal with conceptual barriers in interdisciplinary collaborations between SD and SEM. Table 1 provides a summary of conceptual differences between SD and SEM features, which will elaborated on in the next section as preliminary concepts before presenting our general framework. These differences are issues we will need to address in developing our general framework.\nTable 1. Summary of conceptual differences between SD and SEM\nIt is important to note, first, that the way we resolve these is to develop a common mathematical framework as opposed to the most parsimonious way of describing either method alone. Second, we focus on a common framework that generally covers the usual models from SD and SEM as opposed to a creative way that a method can be embedded within another. For example, system dynamics simulation software can be used to simulate a discrete set of observations and generate results that appear similar to the observed covariance matrices that form the basis of structural equation modeling. While such tricks may satisfy a specific application, they do not provide a general mathematical framework nor lead to a better understanding of how the two approaches are related.\nIn SD, the primary goal is to develop an explanation for a dynamic behavior pattern of interest that is usually represented as a behavior over time graph and often referred to as the reference mode. In contrast, the primary goal of SEM is to estimate the effects and predict an observed covariance matrix from the implied covariance matrix of a causal model.\nDifferences between the goals of the two methods arguably sit within a broader context of concerns about scientific methods, especially as this applies to social systems where the ontology of socially constructed systems (Berger and Luckmann, 1966) requires a scientific strategy that places a greater emphasis on theory appraisal before committing to statistical tests of propositions (Lakatos, 1970; Meehl, 1990).\nSD is essentially about solving the inverse problem of finding a plausible system of feedback mechanisms that can generate the dynamic behavior pattern being studied and the associated parameters of a model whereas SEM is primarily about solving the forward problem of predicting the effects from a given model.\nThe distinction between solving the forward problem versus the inverse problem is nontrivial. In the forward problem, the goal is to predict a response variable based on a model of predictor variables. For example, in y = a + b \u22c5 x y=a+b\\cdot x , y y is the response variable, and x x is the predictor variable with a a and b b constants. This can be simplified into a functional description as y = f \u200b ( x , a , b ) y=f(x,a,b) . When focused on inverse problems, the goal is fundamentally different where we want to find the function f f where y = f \u200b ( x , a , b ) y=f(x,a,b) . That is, we are less concerned with how well our identified function f f that maps ( x , a , b ) (x,a,b) onto y y fits, and more interested in which functions, if any, could do this.\nConfusion often arises in interdisciplinary conversations trying to understand SD results when people ask how the parameters or strength of the effects in causal relationships are determined. From the perspective of SD, there are lots of ways to assign a value to a parameter or causal relationship in a system dynamics model including grounding parameters empirically using a range of mixed methods. (i.e., from Delphi methods with experts to numerical estimates derived from meta-analysis) and stating Bayesian priors. However, the question is often misplaced because SD is focused on solving the inverse problem of finding plausible systems of differential equations and parameters that could explain the dynamics of the reference mode, not the forward problem of estimating the parameters and the effects of a model, which is often the primary concern in areas such epidemiology and biostatistics.\nWhat we ultimately want to do is show these two methods of solving the inverse problem and forward problem are complementary, not an either/or, and understanding this is essential for gaining a better grasp of the complexity of social systems for developing and sustaining a strong progressive program of research (Lakatos, 1970).\nSystem dynamics is essentially about finding a set of causal feedback relationships that can generate a given behavior pattern of interest, that is, solving the inverse problem as opposed to the forward problem of predicting what will happen given a set of causal relationships. System dynamics models are typically represented as either a causal loop diagram or a stock and flow diagram (Figures 1a and 1b) whereas structural equation models use path diagrams (Figure 1c). Although appearing similar, the conventions differ. For example, system dynamics models focus on identifying the set of balancing and reinforcing loops with loop labels using a B prefix for balancing loops and R prefix for reinforcing loops, whereas structural equation models generally do not even include explicit labels for feedback when they appear as cycles or non-recursive relationships as shown in Figure 1c.\nMore significant is the fact that structural equation models make an explicit distinction between (1) latent or unobserved variables as circles or ovals and (2) indicators or observed variables as rectangles (Figure 1c). In system dynamics, the main distinction is between stocks and flows, as shown in a stock and flow diagram (Figure 1b) where rectangles represent accumulations or stocks, and circles represent converters that include rates of change or flows (shown in Figure 1b with a value), endogenous variables, and exogenous variables and constant parameters. Causal loop diagrams generally do not make a visual distinction between stocks and flows and therefore drop the use of circles and rectangles altogether.\nSystem dynamics explicitly call out exogenous parameters in a model, e.g., \u03b2 \u200b 1 \\beta 1 and \u03b2 \u200b 2 \\beta 2 in Figures 1a and 1b, however, structural equation models generally do not because these are to be estimated by fitting the specified model to data. Meanwhile, standard structural equation models will generally include not only the indicators ( X \u200b 1 X1 , X \u200b 2 X2 , X \u200b 3 X3 , and X \u200b 4 X4 ) and their corresponding error terms in the measurement model ( \u03b5 \u200b 1 \\varepsilon 1 , \u03b5 \u200b 2 \\varepsilon 2 , \u03b5 \u200b 3 \\varepsilon 3 , and \u03b5 \u200b 4 \\varepsilon 4 ) (Figure 1c). 1 1 1 Note that extensions of the standard SEM model allow for error terms to be correlated.\nAdding to the confusion is that the relationship between causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and stock and flow diagrams (SFDs) in system dynamics is often ambiguous when going from a CLD to an SFD, but exact when going from an SFD to a CLD because CLDs are often conceptualized without explicitly identifying the accumulations and their corresponding flows. Figure 1a comes from drawing the CLD based on the SFD shown in Figure 1b. However, there are often numerous ways to translate a CLD into a SFD (Figure 1a being an exception by explicitly identifying the rate of change as d \u200b X dX for the variable X X which would imply that X X is an accumulation or stock variable).\nThe ambiguity of CLDs concerning their translation into SFDs leads some to caution against their use in system dynamics because they contribute to errors in conceptualizing systems and interpreting the behavior of systems (Richardson, 1997). Nonetheless, CLDs remain a popular choice in systems thinking because the diagramming conventions are often seen as easier to learn and use, especially when the goal is not to develop a formal system dynamics computer simulation model. Moreover, their similarity to the causal structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and latent causal structures in path diagrams have encouraged statisticians and more recently data scientists to view CLDs as an extension of DAGs, usually without recognizing some of their limitations and appreciating the significance of accumulations in feedback systems.\nWe will need to address these differences in formulating a general SD-SEM framework by defining a set of diagramming conventions that highlight the homomorphism of symbols between the two approaches. To do this, we will ultimately show an SD and SEM version of each system for each of the subsequent examples in hopes that this will enable readers trained in one approach to follow the argument and see the connection to the other approach.\nSystem dynamics and structural equation modeling deal with two entirely different sets of equations. System dynamics builds on a framework of nonlinear differential equations, which have an causal system represented by a system of differential equations, and an analytic or numerically approximated solution using computer simulation. Structural equation modeling uses a system of linear equations to represent the causal system and measurement model, which can be generalized to include nonlinear interaction terms, and an implied covariance matrix. Confusions arise between structural equation modeling and system dynamics modeling because people tend to either (1) associate the causal system of differential equations in SD with the linear equations representing the latent causal structure in SEM, or (2) associate the solution to the system of differential equations in SD with implied covariance matrix in SEM. The next two subsections aim to make this distinction more explicit.\nSD models consist of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are specified as a set of integral equations representing causal relationships in the system: 2 2 2 The symbol \u222b t 0 t \\int_{t_{0}}^{t} is the integral from t 0 t_{0} to time t t . To avoid confusion between the time t t that we are integrating to and the time we are integrating over between t 0 t_{0} to time t t , we follow the convention of u u and d \u200b u du as dummy variables for t t .\nwhere \ud835\udc99 \u200b ( \ud835\udc95 ) \\bm{x(t)} is a vector of state variables or stocks, \ud835\udc99 \u200b ( \ud835\udc95 ) = ( x 1 \u200b ( t ) , \u2026 , x k \u200b ( t ) ) \\bm{x(t)}=(x_{1}(t),...,x_{k}(t)) at time t t , where we use lowercase Roman bold font for vectors. The function f f is a vector of rates of change or flows in the system, which is a function of the vector of stock variables, \ud835\udc99 \u200b ( \ud835\udc95 ) \\bm{x(t)} , and a vector of constants \ud835\udc84 = ( c 1 , \u2026 , c j ) \\bm{c}=(c_{1},...,c_{j}) . The initial values of the stocks at t 0 t_{0} are defined by the vector \ud835\udc99 \ud835\udc95 \ud835\udfce = ( x 1 \u200b ( t 0 ) , \u2026 , x k \u200b ( t 0 ) ) \\bm{x_{t_{0}}}=(x_{1}(t_{0}),...,x_{k}(t_{0})) .\nWhen a system of integral equations is used to describe a causal system and its behavior, there are essentially two different sets of equations involved: (a) the system of differential equations representing the causal system as rate equations, and (b) the solution to the system of integral equations as shown below.\nFor linear systems of ordinary differential equations, we can generally find a solution to a given system. For example, in a population model where births, b \u200b i \u200b r \u200b t \u200b h \u200b s \u200b ( t ) births(t) are proportional to the size of the population, p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) pop(t) , we have, b \u200b i \u200b r \u200b t \u200b h \u200b s \u200b ( t ) = c \u22c5 p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) births(t)=c\\cdot pop(t) where c c represents a constant, i.e., fractional birth rate. This is the causal system for this simple linear model, which has the following solution:\nHence,\nEquation (1) is the causal system relating population size to birth rate, and equation (2) is the solution to (1) where population, p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) pop(t) , is the behavior of the system over time t t and a function of the constant c c and initial population p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t 0 ) pop(t_{0}) at t 0 t_{0} . If we can analytically solve (1) to find (2), then we can use data to estimate the parameter c c with a nonlinear regression and draw inferences about how a change in c c or the initial value p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t 0 ) pop(t_{0}) affects the behavior over time of p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) pop(t) .\nHowever, methods for finding analytic solutions of the form (2) are generally only available for systems of linear ordinary differential equations and special cases of nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. System dynamics is primarily concerned with systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations where a common approach is to solve the system of equations through numerical. integration methods. That is, in system dynamics, we find a numerical approximation of the solution (2) by simulating equation (1) over time. On the occassions when an analytic solution is available, we can compare the analytic solution (2), which is exact, against our numerically approximated solution from simulation to evaluate the performance of the numerical approximation.\nThis distinction becomes important when considering the differences because there are approaches in SEM to modeling dynamical systems that rely on estimating coefficients of an underlying causal system from data for where the analytic solutions are already known. This usually entails assuming a simple mathematical causal description of a system based on known mathematical models from biology or physics, e.g., population growth, oscillating pendulum, and seeking find mechanisms in the real system of interest that correspond to simple biological or physical mechanisms. There can be many situations where this is convenient and makes sense scientifically, but it is fundamentally different from the exercise in system dynamics of building up a causal system based on operational knowledge of the system and other known or hypothesized mechanisms (e.g., from scientific literature, interviews, group model building).\nStuctural equation modeling builds on the idea of representing a system as a set of relationships between a vector endogenous latent variables \ud835\udf3c = ( \u03b7 1 , \u2026 , \u03b7 m ) \\bm{\\eta}=(\\eta_{1},...,\\eta_{m}) measured by a vector observed variables \ud835\udc9a = ( y 1 , \u2026 , y p ) \\bm{y}=(y_{1},...,y_{p}) ,, and a vector of exogenous latent variables \ud835\udf43 = ( \u03be 1 , \u2026 , \u03be n ) \\bm{\\xi}=(\\xi_{1},...,\\xi_{n}) measured by a vector of observed variables \ud835\udc99 = ( x 1 , \u2026 , x q ) \\bm{x}=(x_{1},...,x_{q}) (Gunzler, Perzynksi, Carle, 2021). The relationships are described in the LISREL matrix form as structural model and measurement model .\nThe latent causal model is defined as,\nwhere \u03b1 \u03b7 = ( \u03b1 1 , \u2026 , \u03b1 m ) \\mathbf{\\alpha}_{\\eta}=(\\alpha_{1},...,\\alpha_{m}) , B \\mathrm{B} is a m \u00d7 m m\\times m matrix of slopes relating the endogenous latent variables, and \u0393 \\Gamma is a m \u00d7 n m\\times n matrix of slopes related endogenous to exogenous latent variables, and \u03b6 \\mathbf{\\zeta} is a vector of random error terms, \u03b6 = ( \u03b6 1 , \u2026 , \u03b6 m ) \\mathbf{\\zeta}=(\\zeta_{1},...,\\zeta_{m}) .\nThe measurement model is then defined as,\nwhere \ud835\udf42 y \\bm{\\nu}_{y} and \ud835\udf42 x \\bm{\\nu}_{x} are vectors representing intercepts for \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} and \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} respectively, \ud835\udeb2 y \\bm{\\Lambda}_{y} and \ud835\udeb2 x \\bm{\\Lambda}_{x} represent matrices of slopes or factor loadings for \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} and \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} respectively, and \u03f5 \\bm{\\epsilon} and \ud835\udf39 \\bm{\\delta} are vectors representing measurement errors for \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} and \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} respectively.\nMatrix equations (3) and (4) form the basis for calculating an implied covariance matrix \u2211 ( \ud835\udc7a ) \\bm{\\sum(S)} from parameters \ud835\udc7a \\bm{S} that can be compared against the observed covariance matrix \u2211 \\bm{\\sum} . Restrictions arise in SEM from the assumptions required to calculate the implied covariance matrix from (3) and (4). Extensions to (3) and (4) allow for the inclusion of nonlinear terms such as a polynomials and interactions between two latent variables.\nThe term \u2018dynamic\u2019 takes on different meanings in system dynamics and structural equation modeling. In structural equation modeling, particularly dynamic structural equation modeling, the term \u2018dynamic\u2019 means change over time, e.g., in longitudinal and time series patterns. However, in system dynamics, the term \u2018dynamic\u2019 refers not specifically to the behavior of a system changing over time, but the formal mathematical distinction between a static versus a dynamic system (see, for example, Palm 1983). In a static system , the output of a system y \u200b ( t ) y(t) is strictly a function of the input x \u200b ( t ) x(t) , i.e., y \u200b ( t ) = f \u200b ( x \u200b ( t ) ) y(t)=f(x(t)) . In a dynamic system , the output is a function of both the input and the state of the system, i.e., y \u200b ( t ) = f \u200b ( x \u200b ( t ) , y \u200b ( t ) ) y(t)=f(x(t),y(t)) . That is, what differentiates a static and dynamic system is not whether the output is changing over time, but whether how the output changes with the input. Consider an example of turning a light on and off, one and off. As soon as the input stabilizes, the output is stable (the light is either on or off). The light switch and light in this example represent a static system.\nThat is not true in a dynamic system. Consider an example of central heating and cooling in a building where one increases the desired temperature relative to some outside temperature with the expectation that the indoor temperature will rise to match the desired temperature. Once the desired temperature is set and assuming the outdoor temperature also remains constant, the indoor temperature will continue to change toward the desired temperature even though the inputs are stable.\nThe distinction between static and dynamic systems is something we will leverage in formulating our general SD-SEM framework and use to show how the general SEM framework maps into the static portion of a system dynamics model.\nBoth system dynamics and structural equation modeling generally assume that the underlying variables of the causal system are continuous, although there are ways to extend both to allow for discrete values. However, system dynamics and structural equation modeling differ in how variables are viewed over time.\nStructural equation modeling builds on a set of finite observations, which are discrete. System dynamics models simulate a continuous system over time, which is in contrast to discrete event simulation and agent based modeling, which simulate a system in discrete events. The continuous time perspective often gets confused with the discrete time approximation of a continuous system, so that people often make the mistake of assuming that the discrete time-step ( D \u200b T DT or \u0394 \u200b T \\Delta T ) of numerical integration used to calculate an approximate solution to the continuous time system should be the same as the observation times. That is, if there 10 observations of the real system, then the system dynamics model should be simulated in 10 time steps.\nThis confusion gets compounded when longitudinal observations are recorded and analyzed by their position in a longitudinal sequence (i.e., y 1 , y 2 , \u2026 , y k y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{k} ) as opposed to their actual time of data collection (i.e., y \u200b ( t 1 ) , y \u200b ( t 2 ) , \u2026 , y \u200b ( t k ) y(t_{1}),y(t_{2}),...,y(t_{k}) ). Varying differences between the actual time of observation, i.e., t 2 \u2212 t 1 , t 3 \u2212 t 2 , \u2026 , t k \u2212 t k \u2212 1 t_{2}-t_{1},t_{3}-t_{2},...,t_{k}-t_{k-1} , can lead to distortions in the shape or behavior modes of a curve, especially when the sampling period is large relative to the time constants in a system dynamics model.\nThis has implications for how we handle measurement error in developing a general framework because we need to consider both the measurement error associated with the value and time when bringing discrete observations into a measurement model for system dynamics.\nApproaches to measures of fit between models and observations differ considerably between system dynamics and structural equation modeling both in their respective practices and development. Whereas structural equation modeling has placed a strong emphasis on developing and critically using both global and local measures of fit along with standard reporting guidelines that emphasize multiple measures versus relying on a single measure, system dynamics has not. For example, despite an insistence by Sterman (2000) to provide an assessment of fit and decompose the error using Theil inequality statistics, most published system dynamics models still do not report as a matter of standard practice their fit with observed reference modes.\nWhile this might be attributed to differences between the underlying goal of modeling in system dynamics and structural equation modeling and greater reliance on measures of fit in structural equation modeling for selecting and refining models, there is essentially no excuse in system dynamics for not providing model assessments of fit even if these are known to be weak confidence building tests.\nWe will return to measures in fit as the general model we propose allows for drawing on work in structural equation modeling and specifically, ways to leverage the newer methods in system dynamics for predicting link and loop scores as a basis for formulating structural equation models that solve the forward problem of prediction.\nSD models are inherently under-determined, meaning that no set of observations will uniquely identify the system dynamics model and parameters. There is, in fact, an infinite set of models and parameters to consider. However, SD does not rely on numeric data alone to identify a model and recognizes that in social systems, people are also actors and observers of systems and hence have subjective qualitative knowledge about the structure of the system and decision rules within the bounded rationality of experience (e.g., Forrester, 1980; Sterman, 2000). SD models in this sense are not uniquely identified in the numeric sense, but given that the goal is to solve the inverse problem, that is also not critical.\nThe focus on solving the forward problem in SEM means the model needs to be identifiable, and hence models in SEM need to be identifiable in their specification, which emphasizes developing and using heuristics such as the minimum number of indicators per latent variables and concerns about the number of observations where models in SEM may be uniquely determined or overdetermined.",

This can be simplified into a functional description as y = f \u200b ( x , a , b ) y=f(x,a,b) . When focused on inverse problems, the goal is fundamentally different where we want to find the function f f where y = f \u200b ( x , a , b ) y=f(x,a,b) . That is, we are less concerned with how well our identified function f f that maps ( x , a , b ) (x,a,b) onto y y fits, and more interested in which functions, if any, could do this.\nConfusion often arises in interdisciplinary conversations trying to understand SD results when people ask how the parameters or strength of the effects in causal relationships are determined. From the perspective of SD, there are lots of ways to assign a value to a parameter or causal relationship in a system dynamics model including grounding parameters empirically using a range of mixed methods. (i.e., from Delphi methods with experts to numerical estimates derived from meta-analysis) and stating Bayesian priors. However, the question is often misplaced because SD is focused on solving the inverse problem of finding plausible systems of differential equations and parameters that could explain the dynamics of the reference mode, not the forward problem of estimating the parameters and the effects of a model, which is often the primary concern in areas such epidemiology and biostatistics.\nWhat we ultimately want to do is show these two methods of solving the inverse problem and forward problem are complementary, not an either/or, and understanding this is essential for gaining a better grasp of the complexity of social systems for developing and sustaining a strong progressive program of research (Lakatos, 1970).",

                "paragraphs": "System dynamics is essentially about finding a set of causal feedback relationships that can generate a given behavior pattern of interest, that is, solving the inverse problem as opposed to the forward problem of predicting what will happen given a set of causal relationships. System dynamics models are typically represented as either a causal loop diagram or a stock and flow diagram (Figures 1a and 1b) whereas structural equation models use path diagrams (Figure 1c). Although appearing similar, the conventions differ. For example, system dynamics models focus on identifying the set of balancing and reinforcing loops with loop labels using a B prefix for balancing loops and R prefix for reinforcing loops, whereas structural equation models generally do not even include explicit labels for feedback when they appear as cycles or non-recursive relationships as shown in Figure 1c.\nMore significant is the fact that structural equation models make an explicit distinction between (1) latent or unobserved variables as circles or ovals and (2) indicators or observed variables as rectangles (Figure 1c). In system dynamics, the main distinction is between stocks and flows, as shown in a stock and flow diagram (Figure 1b) where rectangles represent accumulations or stocks, and circles represent converters that include rates of change or flows (shown in Figure 1b with a value), endogenous variables, and exogenous variables and constant parameters. Causal loop diagrams generally do not make a visual distinction between stocks and flows and therefore drop the use of circles and rectangles altogether.\nSystem dynamics explicitly call out exogenous parameters in a model, e.g., \u03b2 \u200b 1 \\beta 1 and \u03b2 \u200b 2 \\beta 2 in Figures 1a and 1b, however, structural equation models generally do not because these are to be estimated by fitting the specified model to data. Meanwhile, standard structural equation models will generally include not only the indicators ( X \u200b 1 X1 , X \u200b 2 X2 , X \u200b 3 X3 , and X \u200b 4 X4 ) and their corresponding error terms in the measurement model ( \u03b5 \u200b 1 \\varepsilon 1 , \u03b5 \u200b 2 \\varepsilon 2 , \u03b5 \u200b 3 \\varepsilon 3 , and \u03b5 \u200b 4 \\varepsilon 4 ) (Figure 1c). 1 1 1 Note that extensions of the standard SEM model allow for error terms to be correlated.\nAdding to the confusion is that the relationship between causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and stock and flow diagrams (SFDs) in system dynamics is often ambiguous when going from a CLD to an SFD, but exact when going from an SFD to a CLD because CLDs are often conceptualized without explicitly identifying the accumulations and their corresponding flows. Figure 1a comes from drawing the CLD based on the SFD shown in Figure 1b. However, there are often numerous ways to translate a CLD into a SFD (Figure 1a being an exception by explicitly identifying the rate of change as d \u200b X dX for the variable X X which would imply that X X is an accumulation or stock variable).\nThe ambiguity of CLDs concerning their translation into SFDs leads some to caution against their use in system dynamics because they contribute to errors in conceptualizing systems and interpreting the behavior of systems (Richardson, 1997). Nonetheless, CLDs remain a popular choice in systems thinking because the diagramming conventions are often seen as easier to learn and use, especially when the goal is not to develop a formal system dynamics computer simulation model. Moreover, their similarity to the causal structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and latent causal structures in path diagrams have encouraged statisticians and more recently data scientists to view CLDs as an extension of DAGs, usually without recognizing some of their limitations and appreciating the significance of accumulations in feedback systems.\nWe will need to address these differences in formulating a general SD-SEM framework by defining a set of diagramming conventions that highlight the homomorphism of symbols between the two approaches. To do this, we will ultimately show an SD and SEM version of each system for each of the subsequent examples in hopes that this will enable readers trained in one approach to follow the argument and see the connection to the other approach.",

System dynamics builds on a framework of nonlinear differential equations, which have an causal system represented by a system of differential equations, and an analytic or numerically approximated solution using computer simulation. Structural equation modeling uses a system of linear equations to represent the causal system and measurement model, which can be generalized to include nonlinear interaction terms, and an implied covariance matrix. Confusions arise between structural equation modeling and system dynamics modeling because people tend to either (1) associate the causal system of differential equations in SD with the linear equations representing the latent causal structure in SEM, or (2) associate the solution to the system of differential equations in SD with implied covariance matrix in SEM. The next two subsections aim to make this distinction more explicit.\nSD models consist of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are specified as a set of integral equations representing causal relationships in the system: 2 2 2 The symbol \u222b t 0 t \\int_{t_{0}}^{t} is the integral from t 0 t_{0} to time t t . To avoid confusion between the time t t that we are integrating to and the time we are integrating over between t 0 t_{0} to time t t , we follow the convention of u u and d \u200b u du as dummy variables for t t .\nwhere \ud835\udc99 \u200b ( \ud835\udc95 ) \\bm{x(t)} is a vector of state variables or stocks, \ud835\udc99 \u200b ( \ud835\udc95 ) = ( x 1 \u200b ( t ) , \u2026 , x k \u200b ( t ) ) \\bm{x(t)}=(x_{1}(t),...,x_{k}(t)) at time t t , where we use lowercase Roman bold font for vectors.

For example, in a population model where births, b \u200b i \u200b r \u200b t \u200b h \u200b s \u200b ( t ) births(t) are proportional to the size of the population, p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) pop(t) , we have, b \u200b i \u200b r \u200b t \u200b h \u200b s \u200b ( t ) = c \u22c5 p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) births(t)=c\\cdot pop(t) where c c represents a constant, i.e., fractional birth rate. This is the causal system for this simple linear model, which has the following solution:\nHence,\nEquation (1) is the causal system relating population size to birth rate, and equation (2) is the solution to (1) where population, p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) pop(t) , is the behavior of the system over time t t and a function of the constant c c and initial population p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t 0 ) pop(t_{0}) at t 0 t_{0} . If we can analytically solve (1) to find (2), then we can use data to estimate the parameter c c with a nonlinear regression and draw inferences about how a change in c c or the initial value p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t 0 ) pop(t_{0}) affects the behavior over time of p \u200b o \u200b p \u200b ( t ) pop(t) .\nHowever, methods for finding analytic solutions of the form (2) are generally only available for systems of linear ordinary differential equations and special cases of nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations.

In structural equation modeling, particularly dynamic structural equation modeling, the term \u2018dynamic\u2019 means change over time, e.g., in longitudinal and time series patterns. However, in system dynamics, the term \u2018dynamic\u2019 refers not specifically to the behavior of a system changing over time, but the formal mathematical distinction between a static versus a dynamic system (see, for example, Palm 1983). In a static system , the output of a system y \u200b ( t ) y(t) is strictly a function of the input x \u200b ( t ) x(t) , i.e., y \u200b ( t ) = f \u200b ( x \u200b ( t ) ) y(t)=f(x(t)) . In a dynamic system , the output is a function of both the input and the state of the system, i.e., y \u200b ( t ) = f \u200b ( x \u200b ( t ) , y \u200b ( t ) ) y(t)=f(x(t),y(t)) . That is, what differentiates a static and dynamic system is not whether the output is changing over time, but whether how the output changes with the input. Consider an example of turning a light on and off, one and off. As soon as the input stabilizes, the output is stable (the light is either on or off). The light switch and light in this example represent a static system.\nThat is not true in a dynamic system. Consider an example of central heating and cooling in a building where one increases the desired temperature relative to some outside temperature with the expectation that the indoor temperature will rise to match the desired temperature. Once the desired temperature is set and assuming the outdoor temperature also remains constant, the indoor temperature will continue to change toward the desired temperature even though the inputs are stable.\nThe distinction between static and dynamic systems is something we will leverage in formulating our general SD-SEM framework and use to show how the general SEM framework maps into the static portion of a system dynamics model.",

System dynamics models simulate a continuous system over time, which is in contrast to discrete event simulation and agent based modeling, which simulate a system in discrete events. The continuous time perspective often gets confused with the discrete time approximation of a continuous system, so that people often make the mistake of assuming that the discrete time-step ( D \u200b T DT or \u0394 \u200b T \\Delta T ) of numerical integration used to calculate an approximate solution to the continuous time system should be the same as the observation times.

For example, despite an insistence by Sterman (2000) to provide an assessment of fit and decompose the error using Theil inequality statistics, most published system dynamics models still do not report as a matter of standard practice their fit with observed reference modes.\nWhile this might be attributed to differences between the underlying goal of modeling in system dynamics and structural equation modeling and greater reliance on measures of fit in structural equation modeling for selecting and refining models, there is essentially no excuse in system dynamics for not providing model assessments of fit even if these are known to be weak confidence building tests.\nWe will return to measures in fit as the general model we propose allows for drawing on work in structural equation modeling and specifically, ways to leverage the newer methods in system dynamics for predicting link and loop scores as a basis for formulating structural equation models that solve the forward problem of prediction.",

There is, in fact, an infinite set of models and parameters to consider. However, SD does not rely on numeric data alone to identify a model and recognizes that in social systems, people are also actors and observers of systems and hence have subjective qualitative knowledge about the structure of the system and decision rules within the bounded rationality of experience (e.g., Forrester, 1980; Sterman, 2000). SD models in this sense are not uniquely identified in the numeric sense, but given that the goal is to solve the inverse problem, that is also not critical.\nThe focus on solving the forward problem in SEM means the model needs to be identifiable, and hence models in SEM need to be identifiable in their specification, which emphasizes developing and using heuristics such as the minimum number of indicators per latent variables and concerns about the number of observations where models in SEM may be uniquely determined or overdetermined.",

        "paragraphs": "This section presents the overall framework from the perspective of the system dynamics modeling process where we start with a reference mode, followed by the diagramming conventions we will use for our framework, and then the general mathematical form of the proposed SD-SEM framework with some examples.\nThe concept of a reference mode is unique to system dynamics and often misunderstood outside the field along with the significance of defining a reference mode for understanding systems. A reference mode is a formal statement of the focal dynamic problem or issue of interest which can be stated in words, but more typically as a graph of system behavior over time (e.g., Richardson and Pugh, 1986).\nReference modes can consist of one or more variables over time, but typically only a few variables at most as the goal is to focus the problem or issue down to a few variables. This effort to focus the problem on a few variables over a specific time horizon is a form of problem structuring, and something that distinguishes system dynamics from more general systems thinking and causal mapping that often involve many variables and feedback loops without consideration of a reference mode.\nHence, central to modeling a feedback system in defining a reference mode is the selection of the time horizon of the reference mode because this essentially limits which feedback loops and accumulations are going to be relevant for the investigation. In the real system, dynamic phenomena are occurring simultaneously at multiple scales from the smallest interval of time of 10 \u2212 43 10^{-43} seconds (i.e., Planck time) to billions of years (i.e., Eons). However, defining the time horizon in a reference mode gives us a temporal lens to view view the dynamics and relevant feedback loops and accumulations.\nIt is important to note that reference modes as problem structuring are idealized abstractions of the system behavior that is of interest and hence not identical with the longitudinal or time series data, nor restricted to what data are available. That said, reference modes should be empirically grounded. Building a model to solve a dynamic problem that is not supported by data risks solving fictional problems. There are too many real problems in the world to work on that can benefit from system dynamics insights to be chasing problems that are not grounded in reality.\nThe type of data that might be used to support a reference mode can range from qualitative graphs over time elicited through group model building workshops to longitudinal data and intensive time series numeric data. A key methodological decision in system dynamics is selecting the appropriate time horizon and variables for defining the reference mode, and hence questions arise about the implications of choosing a different time horizon or having more variables as part of the reference mode. Other issues arise as well in how we empirically ground a reference mode, especially when using subjective qualitative recalling trends over time or rely on a limited number observations over time with measurement error.\nIn our framework, we distinguish the observed data over time \ud835\udc1b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \\mathbf{b(t)} from our reference mode \ud835\udc2b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \\mathbf{r(t)} where the claim is that \ud835\udc2b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \u2248 \ud835\udc1b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \\mathbf{r(t)}\\approx\\mathbf{b(t)} . If we consider a hypothetical example of a problem focusing on new user adoption over a time horizon of h = 30 h=30 weeks from our initial time of t I = 0 t_{I}=0 to our final time of t F t_{F} , Figure 2 is observed behavior of the system b \u200b ( t ) b(t) and Figure 3 reference mode r \u200b ( t ) r(t) based on b \u200b ( t ) b(t) . Note that we could have alternative definitions of our dynamic problem even on this time scale, focusing on the overall trend instead of including the damped oscillation or focusing on only the oscillation as opposed to the declining trend. How we choose to define a problem is not visible to others for review, critique, and later communicating the insights to others unless we have made our reference mode explicit and distinguished this from the data we use to define the reference mode.\nFigure 4 shows the two diagramming conventions we will adopt for depicting the system of causal relationships and observed variables as SD and SEM diagrams that are equivalent in the sense that every symbol in one diagram has an exact correspondence in the other and vice versa . This should not be interpreted to imply the claim that SD and SEM are mathematically equivalent, i.e., that for every SD model there is a mathematically equivalent SEM model and for every SEM model there is a mathematically equivalent SD model. Instead, this diagrammatic equivalence is a precondition to any claims of mathematical equivalence between SD and SEM. That is, if SD and SEM are mathematically equivalent, then there would be at least one isomorphism between SD and SEM diagramming conventions. Our claim here is that this pair of diagramming conventions is sufficient to meet this precondition.\nFigure 4 a shows the SD conventions we will use. Circles will be used to represent converters or auxiliary variables. These variables we simulate over time. Loop labels (e.g., R1 and B1) refer to the strength of the loop, e.g., their normalized loop score. Boxes represent accumulations as stocks. The double lines (e.g., defining d \u200b x dx ) defines d \u200b x dx as a transition or flow into and out of the stock x x . A double line across a causal link indicates a delay. All variables in circles and boxes (converters, flows, and stocks) can in principle be measured or observed from a system dynamics perspective. We will use \u03b4 \\delta prefixes to represent exogenous disturbance terms (e.g., step functions, pulse functions, random noise) and \u03b2 \\beta prefixes to represent parameters (e.g., time constants, fractional rates, proportions).\nThe symbols \u03bb \\lambda , \u03b8 \\theta and \u03f5 \\epsilon take on special meaning as unknown parameters in our measurement model. They are included in our model and simulated, but are not variables that would be considered exogenous or endogenous in the system dynamics sense. More specifically, drawing on structural equation modeling, the true values of these parameters are always unknown. We may be able to estimate them once we have specified and identified our model, but we do not know their true value. Moreover, we can make assumptions about whether or not we will allow for these terms to be correlated by using the curved double arrow convention from SEM measurement models.\nFigure 4 a shows a measurement model with z \u200b 1 z1 , z \u200b 2 z2 , z \u200b 3 z3 and z \u200b 4 z4 being the observed indicators of x x with \u03bb \u200b 1 \\lambda 1 , \u03bb \u200b 2 \\lambda 2 , \u03bb \u200b 3 \\lambda 3 and \u03bb \u200b 4 \\lambda 4 representing the correlation between the indicators and x x , \u03b8 \u200b 1 \\theta 1 , \u03b8 \u200b 2 \\theta 2 , \u03b8 \u200b 3 \\theta 3 and \u03b8 \u200b 4 \\theta 4 the temporal lag or delay between indicators and x x , and \u03f5 \u200b 1 \\epsilon 1 , \u03f5 \u200b 2 \\epsilon 2 , \u03f5 \u200b 3 \\epsilon 3 and \u03f5 \u200b 4 \\epsilon 4 the measurement errors for each indicator where in the standard SEM model, the measurement errors are uncorrelated, i.e., they satisfy the assumption of being independent and identically distributed.\nFigure 4 b shows the equivalent SEM conventions that we will use. Circles represent latent variables and boxes represent observed variables or indicators. The terms \u03b2 \u200b 1 \\beta 1 , \u03b2 \u200b 2 \\beta 2 , and \u03b2 \u200b 3 \\beta 3 represent the parameters being estimated the define the strength of the hypothesized causal relationship between latent variables. The terms \u03b4 \u200b 1 \\delta 1 and \u03b4 \u200b 1 \\delta 1 represent exogenous disturbance terms. \u03bb \u200b 1 \\lambda 1 , \u03bb \u200b 2 \\lambda 2 , \u03bb \u200b 3 \\lambda 3 and \u03bb \u200b 4 \\lambda 4 are the correlations between the indicators and latent variable. We include \u03b8 \u200b 1 \\theta 1 , \u03b8 \u200b 2 \\theta 2 , \u03b8 \u200b 3 \\theta 3 and \u03b8 \u200b 4 \\theta 4 , which are not part of a standard measurement model, to represent the lags between the latent variable and indicators. \u03f5 \u200b 1 \\epsilon 1 , \u03f5 \u200b 2 \\epsilon 2 , \u03f5 \u200b 3 \\epsilon 3 and \u03f5 \u200b 4 \\epsilon 4 take their usual meaning in SEM as measurement error terms.\nSEM does not have a convention for representing causal relationships involving accumulations of rates of change, which has led to some confusion in trying to estimate causal effects that affect state variables as direct effects other than a rate of change. This stems from a long-standing confusion about the direction of causation in ordinary differential equations and their equivalent integral equations going back to at least to 1894 when Heinrich Hertz (2003) identified the issue in The Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form , a point that has been reiterated by Forrester in talks and papers including Principles of System Dynamics (1990) cautioning against the misinterpretation of direction of causality from taking a derivative.\nHowever, the nature of causation is that the rate of change is the direct effect that causes the state variable to change, not the other way around. This is a mathematical relationship, not a statistical relationship. The direct causes of the level of water in a bathtub are from the faucet(s) and drain(s). This is what rates of change \u201cdo\u201d mathematically, they directly change the stocks. This does not mean that the stock and other variables cannot affect the the rates or flows, but it is always indirectly through a rate of flow variable.\nWhat is missing from the SEM diagramming conventions is a way to convey a mathematical relationship of accumulations from rates of change or flows. In stating this is a mathematical relationship, we mean this is not a statistical relationship in the way that \u03b2 \u200b 1 \\beta 1 , \u03b2 \u200b 2 \\beta 2 , \u03b2 \u200b 3 \\beta 3 , or \u03b2 \u200b 4 \\beta 4 are estimated from data, but a mathematical relationship that follows from the accumulation or integration of a rate of change over time.\nTo address this, we use the SD convention of delay symbol or double line across a causal link to indicate accumulation. Hence, the causal link from d \u200b x dx to x x indicates that x x accumulates or integrates d \u200b x dx over time. There is no parameter to be estimated from this causal relationship because the causality of integration is mathematical, i.e., it follows from our statement of a derivative, rates of change, or flows with respect to a state variable or stock.\nOur approach for the general framework is to decompose the model of a system into three sets of equations or subsystems: the dynamic subsystem, the static subsystem, and the measurement subsystem. The dynamic subsystem describes the rate equations as a matrix of static variables. The static subsystem describes the static variables as a matrix of linear and interaction terms between the stocks or state variables and static variables. The measurement subsystem describes the indicators or observed variables as a matrix of linear combinations of dynamic and state variables of the model.\nIn our general framework, we consider a system over time t t from the start or initial time t I t_{I} to the end or final time t F t_{F} with a time horizon of t H = t F \u2212 t I t_{H}=t_{F}-t_{I} , and a model with m m latent state variables or stocks represented as a column vector \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} , n n latent static variables or auxiliaries as a column vector \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} , and p p indicators or observed variables as a column vector \ud835\udc9b \\bm{z} with q q observations over [ t I , t F ] [t_{I},t_{F}] in the observed data matrix or frame \ud835\udc76 \\bm{O} ,\nTable 2 provides an overview of the symbols that will be used in the framework along with their meaning.\nTable 2. Symbols and their meaning in the framework\nThe dynamic subsystem consists of expressions of how the state variables or stocks, \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} change over time, \ud835\udc85 \u200b \ud835\udc99 \u200b ( \ud835\udc95 ) / \ud835\udc85 \u200b \ud835\udc95 \\bm{dx(t)/dt} or \ud835\udc85 \u200b \ud835\udc99 \\bm{dx} for simplicity, along with the initial value of the stocks, \ud835\udc99 t 0 \\bm{x}_{t_{0}} . The rate of change \ud835\udc85 \u200b \ud835\udc99 \\bm{dx} is then defined as a column vector as a polynomial combination of coefficients, \u03b2 1 , i , j \u2208 B 1 \\beta_{1,i,j}\\in B_{1} and exponents \u03b3 1 , i , j \u2208 \u0393 1 \\gamma_{1,i,j}\\in\\Gamma_{1} of \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} :\nwhere \u03b2 i , j , \u03b3 i , j \u2208 \u211d \\beta_{i,j},\\gamma_{i,j}\\in\\mathbb{R} are constants, y i y_{i} is a static variable that is a combination of \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} and \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} , \ud835\udc69 \ud835\udfcf \\bm{B_{1}} and \ud835\udeaa \ud835\udfcf \\bm{\\Gamma_{1}} are defined as follows:\nWe can then define the function f f that maps static variables to the rate of change as,\n.\nThe initial conditions are defined as the column vector,\nwhere x i t I x_{i_{t_{I}}} is the initial value of the i i -th state variable or stock at time t I t_{I} . Note that while \ud835\udc99 \ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc70 \\bm{x_{t_{I}}} tends to be a vector of scalar values, it is not uncommon in system dynamics for \ud835\udc99 \ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc70 \\bm{x_{t_{I}}} to be defined by a set of equations that describe the initial values in terms of model parameters for under the condition when the initial rates of change of the system known, e.g., when a system is initially in a dynamic equilibrium.\nThe static subsystem \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} is the sum of three components, (a) the sum terms involving the state variables, \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} , (b) static components, \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} , and (c) two-way interactions, \ud835\udc9a \u2297 \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y}\\otimes\\bm{y} . 3 3 3 The \u2297 \\otimes symbol is the outer product of two vectors \ud835\udc99 = ( x 1 , x 2 , \u22ef , x m ) \\bm{x}=(x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{m}) and \ud835\udc9a = ( y 1 , y 2 , \u22ef , y n ) \\bm{y}=(y_{1},y_{2},\\cdots,y_{n}) where \ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc7b \\bm{y^{T}} is the transpose of \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} and, \ud835\udc99 \u2297 \ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc7b = ( x 1 \u200b y 1 x 1 \u200b y 2 \u22ef x 1 \u200b y n \u22ee \u22ee \u22ee x m \u200b y 1 x m \u200b y 2 \u22ef x m \u200b y n ) . \\bm{x}\\otimes\\bm{y^{T}}=\\begin{pmatrix}x_{1}y_{1}&x_{1}y_{2}&\\cdots&x_{1}y_{n}\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&&\\vdots\\\\\nx_{m}y_{1}&x_{m}y_{2}&\\cdots&x_{m}y_{n}\\end{pmatrix}.\nWe define \u03b2 2 , i , j \u2208 B 2 \\beta_{2,i,j}\\in B_{2} , \u03b2 3 , i , j \u2208 B 3 \\beta_{3,i,j}\\in B_{3} , and \u03b2 3 , i , j \u2208 B 4 \\beta_{3,i,j}\\in B_{4} as coefficients of \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} , \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} and two-way interactions \ud835\udc9a \u2297 \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y}\\otimes\\bm{y} , and \u03b3 2 , i , j \u2208 \u0393 2 \\gamma_{2,i,j}\\in\\Gamma_{2} , \u03b3 3 , i , j \u2208 \u0393 3 \\gamma_{3,i,j}\\in\\Gamma_{3} to be exponents of the latent variables \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} and \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} .\nWe define \u03b2 2 , i , j \u2208 B 2 \\beta_{2,i,j}\\in B_{2} , \u03b2 3 , i , j \u2208 B 3 \\beta_{3,i,j}\\in B_{3} , and \u03b2 3 , i , j \u2208 B 4 \\beta_{3,i,j}\\in B_{4} as coefficients and \u03b3 2 , i , j \u2208 \u0393 2 \\gamma_{2,i,j}\\in\\Gamma_{2} and \u03b3 3 , i , j \u2208 \u0393 3 \\gamma_{3,i,j}\\in\\Gamma_{3} to be exponents of the latent variables \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} and \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} . 4 4 4 We do not need to define exponents for the interaction terms because we can always define a static variable in terms of a power of another static variable :\nwhere, for simplicity, we restrict \u03b2 4 , i , j , j = 0 \\beta_{4,i,j,j}=0 since the interaction term y j \u200b y j y_{j}y_{j} is already included in \u03b2 3 , j , j \\beta_{3,j,j} with the exponent \u03b3 3 , j , j = 2 \\gamma_{3,j,j}=2 .\nIf we then define \ud835\udc69 \ud835\udfd0 \\bm{B_{2}} , \ud835\udc69 \ud835\udfd1 \\bm{B_{3}} ,and \ud835\udc69 \ud835\udfd2 \\bm{B_{4}} as\nfollows:\nAnd,\nwhere the function g g maps latent variable vectors \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} and \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} to \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} :\nThere are several things to note about the static subsystem. First, it is more general than the conventional system dynamics model by allowing for non-recursive or simultaneous relationships between static variables, e.g., situations where there exist i , j \u2208 [ 1 , n ] i,j\\in[1,n] such that \u03b2 3 , i , j \\beta_{3,i,j} and \u03b2 3 , j , i \\beta_{3,j,i} are nonzero as shown in Figure 5 . In general, system dynamics models exclude nonrecursive or simultaneous equations as part of the static subsystem. There are exceptions, for example, as Ventana Vensim includes a built-in function for estimating simultaneous equations, however the general principle in system dynamics is that every feedback loop contain at least one state variable.\nSecond, for system dynamics models, we will generally require \ud835\udc69 \ud835\udfd1 \\bm{B_{3}} and \ud835\udc69 \ud835\udfd2 \\bm{B_{4}} to be of lower triangular matrices with a zero diagonals since one of the basic principles of system dynamics is that every feedback loop must have at least one stock variable.

For simplicity, however, we assume that the measurement error \u03f5 i \\epsilon_{i} associated with each indicator z i z_{i} is constant for each indicator across time, \u03f5 i \u200b ( t j ) = \u03f5 i \u200b ( t k ) \\epsilon_{i}(t_{j})=\\epsilon_{i}(t_{k}) for all j , k \u2208 [ 1 , \u22ef , q ] j,k\\in[1,\\cdots,q] , which is a characteristic of good measurement. In future work, this assumption can be relaxed to consider the sensitivity of methods to measurement error that varies across time or correlated with other terms in a model.\nTo develop our measurement model, we start with t 1 t_{1} , extend this to the t 2 t_{2} and t 3 t_{3} cases, and then our general form with delays. For t 1 t_{1} we then have:\nFor t 2 t_{2} , the indicator variables can be influenced by both the present value of latent variables at t 2 t_{2} and the previous value at t 1 t_{1} , hence:\nFor t 3 t_{3} , the indicator variables can be influenced by both the present value of latent variables at t 3 t_{3} and the previous values at t 2 t_{2} and t 1 t_{1} , hence:\nWe can generalize this for t k t_{k} as the double sums,\nEquation 4 represents the relationship between the indicator z p z_{p} and latent variables x x and y y with lagged observations corresponding to the discrete observations from t 1 t_{1} to t q t_{q} consistent with an SEM measurement model organized around discrete observations. However, system dynamics models are continuous in time and the delays between observations and latent indicators are continuous, i.e., they are not restricted to incremental delays between discrete observations (and rarely are). To address this, we introduce the term \u03b8 \u2208 [ 0 , + \u221e ] \\theta\\in[0,+\\infty] to represent the delay between the observation z i z_{i} and value of the latent variable where the expression x j \u200b ( t k \u2212 \u03b8 i , j ) x_{j}(t_{k}-\\theta_{i,j}) means the value of x j x_{j} at t k t_{k} delayed by \u03b8 i , j \\theta_{i,j} for x j x_{j} . Similar to our assumption that measurement errors for an indicator are constant across time, we make the simplifying assumption that the delays \u03b8 i \\theta_{i} are also constant across time.\nWe thus arrive at our general expression for our indicator z p \u200b ( t k ) z_{p}(t_{k}) as,\nBringing this all together into a more general form, we can define,\nwhere the function h h maps our latent variables \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} and \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} to our observations or data matrix, \ud835\udc81 \\bm{Z} :\n.\nThe general model can then be described as a function f f , g g , and h h along with the initial conditions \ud835\udc31 \ud835\udc2d \ud835\udfce \\mathbf{x_{t_{0}}} over the time horizon or interval [ t I , t f ] [t_{I},t_{f}] as shown in Table 2.\nTable 2.

Specifying a model is then a matter of defining the matrices in Table 2. Although appearing complex on the surface, in the next section we illustrate how models in system dynamics and structural equation modeling can be specified using this general model using a relatively small set of expressions.",

            "paragraphs": "The concept of a reference mode is unique to system dynamics and often misunderstood outside the field along with the significance of defining a reference mode for understanding systems. A reference mode is a formal statement of the focal dynamic problem or issue of interest which can be stated in words, but more typically as a graph of system behavior over time (e.g., Richardson and Pugh, 1986).\nReference modes can consist of one or more variables over time, but typically only a few variables at most as the goal is to focus the problem or issue down to a few variables. This effort to focus the problem on a few variables over a specific time horizon is a form of problem structuring, and something that distinguishes system dynamics from more general systems thinking and causal mapping that often involve many variables and feedback loops without consideration of a reference mode.\nHence, central to modeling a feedback system in defining a reference mode is the selection of the time horizon of the reference mode because this essentially limits which feedback loops and accumulations are going to be relevant for the investigation. In the real system, dynamic phenomena are occurring simultaneously at multiple scales from the smallest interval of time of 10 \u2212 43 10^{-43} seconds (i.e., Planck time) to billions of years (i.e., Eons). However, defining the time horizon in a reference mode gives us a temporal lens to view view the dynamics and relevant feedback loops and accumulations.\nIt is important to note that reference modes as problem structuring are idealized abstractions of the system behavior that is of interest and hence not identical with the longitudinal or time series data, nor restricted to what data are available. That said, reference modes should be empirically grounded. Building a model to solve a dynamic problem that is not supported by data risks solving fictional problems. There are too many real problems in the world to work on that can benefit from system dynamics insights to be chasing problems that are not grounded in reality.\nThe type of data that might be used to support a reference mode can range from qualitative graphs over time elicited through group model building workshops to longitudinal data and intensive time series numeric data. A key methodological decision in system dynamics is selecting the appropriate time horizon and variables for defining the reference mode, and hence questions arise about the implications of choosing a different time horizon or having more variables as part of the reference mode. Other issues arise as well in how we empirically ground a reference mode, especially when using subjective qualitative recalling trends over time or rely on a limited number observations over time with measurement error.\nIn our framework, we distinguish the observed data over time \ud835\udc1b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \\mathbf{b(t)} from our reference mode \ud835\udc2b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \\mathbf{r(t)} where the claim is that \ud835\udc2b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \u2248 \ud835\udc1b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \\mathbf{r(t)}\\approx\\mathbf{b(t)} . If we consider a hypothetical example of a problem focusing on new user adoption over a time horizon of h = 30 h=30 weeks from our initial time of t I = 0 t_{I}=0 to our final time of t F t_{F} , Figure 2 is observed behavior of the system b \u200b ( t ) b(t) and Figure 3 reference mode r \u200b ( t ) r(t) based on b \u200b ( t ) b(t) . Note that we could have alternative definitions of our dynamic problem even on this time scale, focusing on the overall trend instead of including the damped oscillation or focusing on only the oscillation as opposed to the declining trend. How we choose to define a problem is not visible to others for review, critique, and later communicating the insights to others unless we have made our reference mode explicit and distinguished this from the data we use to define the reference mode.",

            "paragraphs": "Figure 4 shows the two diagramming conventions we will adopt for depicting the system of causal relationships and observed variables as SD and SEM diagrams that are equivalent in the sense that every symbol in one diagram has an exact correspondence in the other and vice versa . This should not be interpreted to imply the claim that SD and SEM are mathematically equivalent, i.e., that for every SD model there is a mathematically equivalent SEM model and for every SEM model there is a mathematically equivalent SD model. Instead, this diagrammatic equivalence is a precondition to any claims of mathematical equivalence between SD and SEM. That is, if SD and SEM are mathematically equivalent, then there would be at least one isomorphism between SD and SEM diagramming conventions. Our claim here is that this pair of diagramming conventions is sufficient to meet this precondition.\nFigure 4 a shows the SD conventions we will use. Circles will be used to represent converters or auxiliary variables. These variables we simulate over time. Loop labels (e.g., R1 and B1) refer to the strength of the loop, e.g., their normalized loop score. Boxes represent accumulations as stocks. The double lines (e.g., defining d \u200b x dx ) defines d \u200b x dx as a transition or flow into and out of the stock x x . A double line across a causal link indicates a delay. All variables in circles and boxes (converters, flows, and stocks) can in principle be measured or observed from a system dynamics perspective. We will use \u03b4 \\delta prefixes to represent exogenous disturbance terms (e.g., step functions, pulse functions, random noise) and \u03b2 \\beta prefixes to represent parameters (e.g., time constants, fractional rates, proportions).\nThe symbols \u03bb \\lambda , \u03b8 \\theta and \u03f5 \\epsilon take on special meaning as unknown parameters in our measurement model. They are included in our model and simulated, but are not variables that would be considered exogenous or endogenous in the system dynamics sense. More specifically, drawing on structural equation modeling, the true values of these parameters are always unknown. We may be able to estimate them once we have specified and identified our model, but we do not know their true value. Moreover, we can make assumptions about whether or not we will allow for these terms to be correlated by using the curved double arrow convention from SEM measurement models.\nFigure 4 a shows a measurement model with z \u200b 1 z1 , z \u200b 2 z2 , z \u200b 3 z3 and z \u200b 4 z4 being the observed indicators of x x with \u03bb \u200b 1 \\lambda 1 , \u03bb \u200b 2 \\lambda 2 , \u03bb \u200b 3 \\lambda 3 and \u03bb \u200b 4 \\lambda 4 representing the correlation between the indicators and x x , \u03b8 \u200b 1 \\theta 1 , \u03b8 \u200b 2 \\theta 2 , \u03b8 \u200b 3 \\theta 3 and \u03b8 \u200b 4 \\theta 4 the temporal lag or delay between indicators and x x , and \u03f5 \u200b 1 \\epsilon 1 , \u03f5 \u200b 2 \\epsilon 2 , \u03f5 \u200b 3 \\epsilon 3 and \u03f5 \u200b 4 \\epsilon 4 the measurement errors for each indicator where in the standard SEM model, the measurement errors are uncorrelated, i.e., they satisfy the assumption of being independent and identically distributed.\nFigure 4 b shows the equivalent SEM conventions that we will use.

This stems from a long-standing confusion about the direction of causation in ordinary differential equations and their equivalent integral equations going back to at least to 1894 when Heinrich Hertz (2003) identified the issue in The Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form , a point that has been reiterated by Forrester in talks and papers including Principles of System Dynamics (1990) cautioning against the misinterpretation of direction of causality from taking a derivative.\nHowever, the nature of causation is that the rate of change is the direct effect that causes the state variable to change, not the other way around. This is a mathematical relationship, not a statistical relationship. The direct causes of the level of water in a bathtub are from the faucet(s) and drain(s). This is what rates of change \u201cdo\u201d mathematically, they directly change the stocks. This does not mean that the stock and other variables cannot affect the the rates or flows, but it is always indirectly through a rate of flow variable.\nWhat is missing from the SEM diagramming conventions is a way to convey a mathematical relationship of accumulations from rates of change or flows. In stating this is a mathematical relationship, we mean this is not a statistical relationship in the way that \u03b2 \u200b 1 \\beta 1 , \u03b2 \u200b 2 \\beta 2 , \u03b2 \u200b 3 \\beta 3 , or \u03b2 \u200b 4 \\beta 4 are estimated from data, but a mathematical relationship that follows from the accumulation or integration of a rate of change over time.\nTo address this, we use the SD convention of delay symbol or double line across a causal link to indicate accumulation. Hence, the causal link from d \u200b x dx to x x indicates that x x accumulates or integrates d \u200b x dx over time. There is no parameter to be estimated from this causal relationship because the causality of integration is mathematical, i.e., it follows from our statement of a derivative, rates of change, or flows with respect to a state variable or stock.",

The dynamic subsystem describes the rate equations as a matrix of static variables. The static subsystem describes the static variables as a matrix of linear and interaction terms between the stocks or state variables and static variables. The measurement subsystem describes the indicators or observed variables as a matrix of linear combinations of dynamic and state variables of the model.\nIn our general framework, we consider a system over time t t from the start or initial time t I t_{I} to the end or final time t F t_{F} with a time horizon of t H = t F \u2212 t I t_{H}=t_{F}-t_{I} , and a model with m m latent state variables or stocks represented as a column vector \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} , n n latent static variables or auxiliaries as a column vector \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} , and p p indicators or observed variables as a column vector \ud835\udc9b \\bm{z} with q q observations over [ t I , t F ] [t_{I},t_{F}] in the observed data matrix or frame \ud835\udc76 \\bm{O} ,\nTable 2 provides an overview of the symbols that will be used in the framework along with their meaning.\nTable 2.

First, it is more general than the conventional system dynamics model by allowing for non-recursive or simultaneous relationships between static variables, e.g., situations where there exist i , j \u2208 [ 1 , n ] i,j\\in[1,n] such that \u03b2 3 , i , j \\beta_{3,i,j} and \u03b2 3 , j , i \\beta_{3,j,i} are nonzero as shown in Figure 5 . In general, system dynamics models exclude nonrecursive or simultaneous equations as part of the static subsystem.

For simplicity, however, we assume that the measurement error \u03f5 i \\epsilon_{i} associated with each indicator z i z_{i} is constant for each indicator across time, \u03f5 i \u200b ( t j ) = \u03f5 i \u200b ( t k ) \\epsilon_{i}(t_{j})=\\epsilon_{i}(t_{k}) for all j , k \u2208 [ 1 , \u22ef , q ] j,k\\in[1,\\cdots,q] , which is a characteristic of good measurement. In future work, this assumption can be relaxed to consider the sensitivity of methods to measurement error that varies across time or correlated with other terms in a model.\nTo develop our measurement model, we start with t 1 t_{1} , extend this to the t 2 t_{2} and t 3 t_{3} cases, and then our general form with delays.

However, system dynamics models are continuous in time and the delays between observations and latent indicators are continuous, i.e., they are not restricted to incremental delays between discrete observations (and rarely are). To address this, we introduce the term \u03b8 \u2208 [ 0 , + \u221e ] \\theta\\in[0,+\\infty] to represent the delay between the observation z i z_{i} and value of the latent variable where the expression x j \u200b ( t k \u2212 \u03b8 i , j ) x_{j}(t_{k}-\\theta_{i,j}) means the value of x j x_{j} at t k t_{k} delayed by \u03b8 i , j \\theta_{i,j} for x j x_{j} . Similar to our assumption that measurement errors for an indicator are constant across time, we make the simplifying assumption that the delays \u03b8 i \\theta_{i} are also constant across time.\nWe thus arrive at our general expression for our indicator z p \u200b ( t k ) z_{p}(t_{k}) as,\nBringing this all together into a more general form, we can define,\nwhere the function h h maps our latent variables \ud835\udc99 \\bm{x} and \ud835\udc9a \\bm{y} to our observations or data matrix, \ud835\udc81 \\bm{Z} :\n.\nThe general model can then be described as a function f f , g g , and h h along with the initial conditions \ud835\udc31 \ud835\udc2d \ud835\udfce \\mathbf{x_{t_{0}}} over the time horizon or interval [ t I , t f ] [t_{I},t_{f}] as shown in Table 2.\nTable 2.

        "paragraphs": "In this paper, we have highlighted the differences between structural equation modeling and system dynamics, and then sought to develop a general framework in an effort to bridge the \u201cunavoidable a priori\u201d between two different approaches to causal modeling. The general model (Table 2) defines a set of functions that maps a model specification into a data frame or matrix of observed variables over time.\nThe generality of the approach means that various models from system dynamics and structural equation modeling can be mapped into the same general model. We illustrate this by showing how two standard models, one from system dynamics and another from structural equation modeling, can be represented in this general model. From this, one can represent a wide range of both system dynamics and structural equation models including hybrid models that bring the two approaches together in more interesting ways.\nThe main contribution is not, however, to suggest a parsimonious synthesis of the two approaches, but rather, to define a mathematical space that can be used to systematically generate and compare methods for causal modeling over well-defined distributions of systems. That a mathematical space is complicated shouldn\u2019t be surprising, but that it can be characterized at all within a relatively finite and small set of dimensions that we suspect can cover most of the usual cases in both methods is interesting. Complicated, yes, but not a bridge between two methods that is impossible to build.\nDefining the mathematical space for bridging these two methods provides a means to generate systems in a systematic way and conduct simulation studies to explore the implications of various assumptions on causal inferences from modeling and data. This becomes even more critical today when we consider the implications of implementing AI/ML models in systems that impact society because, more than ever before, we need to understand how the assumptions we make and hence our biases might translate into a algorithmic biases. Presently, we have ideas about how we might be able to mitigate some of these biases and arrive at more accurate and ethical models using causal maps and system dynamics in particular, but without a solid understanding of how methods relate, we are at risk of blindly letting the unavoidable a priori be an excuse for the \u201cunintended\u201d consequences of harm caused by poorly designed AI/ML.\nIf one of the main contributions of system dynamics is to help us think better about the dynamically complex systems we are in and trying to manage, and our method is grounded in a deep mathematical understanding of our natural and social world as dynamic, it behooves us as a discipline to seek out and mathematically reconcile differences with other methods. We do this because there is an underlying principle in system dynamics about how we reconcile competing claims through mathematical models that capture the logic of our views on the world and data. We do this because we care about a fundamental idea of Truth.",

        "The focus in system dynamics (SD) is on understanding the dynamic behavior of systems from an endogenous or feedback perspective through the use of computer simulation of systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (Richardson, 2011).",
        "Understanding the dynamics of systems in SD emphasizes developing an explicit explanation of the structure-behavior relationship in a system, that is, understanding how the dynamics of a system are generated by a set of interacting nonlinear balancing and reinforcing feedback mechanisms.",
        "With advances in implementing formal methods of loop dominance analysis in recent years, this structure-behavior relationship can now be more systematically and rigorously studied by determining the patterns of dominance of feedback mechanisms, which opens up new areas for both theoretical and applied research in understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems.",
        "System dynamics has also gained interest among data scientists and engineers seeking to advance more responsible AI/ML applications.",
        "For example, Ruha Benjamin (2019) sees system dynamics as a potential way to mitigate the biases that appear in AI/ML applications due to incomplete causal knowledge of the societal context by engaging and involving communities in conceptualizing systems using participatory methods.",
        "Researchers at Google Research have also been exploring and motivating the application of system dynamics for better understanding societal context of AI/ML (Kuhlberg et al 2023; Martin & Moore, 2020).",
        "Most recently, for example, Martin and Kinney (2024) have focused on demonstrating how the inclusion of feedback loops can help reduce the epistemic uncertainty of AI/ML models.",
        "However, these efforts have largely focused on comparing the predictive performance of AI/ML models that include feedback loops as opposed to leveraging the deeper structure-behavior relationship of feedback mechanisms.",
        "From a system dynamics perspective, a particular concern has been the difficulty of effectively communicating nonlinear feedback effects involving accumulations to data scientists and statistically oriented fields.",
        "Some of the confusion stems from differences in the diagramming conventions, but also more fundamentally in not having a common mathematical framework for comparing methods.",
        "While this could be attributed to differences in the underlying assumptions, training, and practices as Donella Meadows described as the \u201cunavoidable a priori\u201d in her 1976 conference paper, the various methods are grounded in mathematics and hence can be resolved to create a bridge for better multi- and trans-disciplinary collaborations.",
        "To address this gap, Meadows called for more frequently revisiting our underlying assumptions and comparing methods.",
        "Such situations are not unique nor new, and efforts to formalize the relationship between different approaches can yield interesting results and applications.",
        "For example, there was a long-standing dispute in statistics about the comparability of results between analysis of variance and multiple regression with the resolution eventually leading to the general linear models we rely on today.",
        "In another example, path analysis and partial regression analysis ultimately developed into the LISREL model that integrates latent causal modeling and measurement models to form the basis of modern structural equation modeling (Bollen, 1989).",
        "System dynamicists often shy away from learning and using advanced statistical methods such as structural equation modeling.",
        "This is unfortunate because methods such as SEM can help identify the longitudinal patterns that form the basis of reference modes, establish measures for intangible or \u201csoft\u201d variables, empirically inform some of the causal relationships in our models, and provide additional tools for empirically testing and building confidence in our models and simulation results.",
        "This has led to exclusion of intangible variables from models even when they are known to play a critical role in judgement and decision making, reference modes not being appropriately grounded in data, the use of partial regression estimates to inform causal structure, and a tendency to rely on statistical associations to inform model formulation instead of operational thinking skills.",
        "However, acquiring the statistical training to incorporate methods such as structural equation modeling is often outside the scope of most programs, and statistical courses usually begin with a fundamentally different set of assumption leaving it up to the novice student to figure out the underlying relationships.",
        "This is usually fraught with conceptual challenges where it may be difficult to distinguish what a novice does not yet know about a method from true conceptual differences.",
        "But, the barriers are not limited to the novice learner or student.",
        "Even among established experts, the very experience of looking at a system through dynamics and feedback loops or from the perspective of answering a research question given some data leads to deeply ingrained patterns of thought.",
        "While the mental habits may keep us locked in the \u201cunavoidable a priori\u201d, these methods are mathematical in their description and use.",
        "Mathematics is a powerful tool for exploring and translating ideas in ways that break us out of our patterns of thought.",
        "The similarity of these methods suggests that bridging these different views is more of a problem with mathematical description than some grand unifying theory or discovery.",
        "Hence, this paper is about developing and proposing a mathematical framework that covers both system dynamics and structural equation modeling.",
        "For the field of system dynamics, a mathematical framework in common with related methods would help system dynamicists better integrate advanced statistical tools into system dynamics modeling.",
        "For data scientists and engineers, particularly those working to incorporate system dynamics into AI/ML applications, a common mathematical framework would help data scientists more appropriately and effecttively use results from system dynamics studies to advance statistical methods and applications.",
        "In this paper, we focus specifically on developing a mathematical framework bridging system dynamics and structural equation modeling (e.g., Bollen, 1989; Gunzler, Perzynksi, and Carle, 2021; Pearl, 2009; Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018).",
        "More generally, causal modeling plays a central role in data science and AI/ML applications that inform the evidence-based interventions, practices, and policies that impact our world from medicine and education to economics and the environment.",
        "When the research that informs the development of new products and clinical interventions, for example, excludes theories of systemic causation (Bunge, 1997) as explanations, not only are we likely to misinterpret the effectiveness of interventions and attribute systemic causation (powell,2008) to statistical \u201cnuisance\u201d terms, but find ourselves caught in hopeless capability trap of not being able to understand our dynamically complex and changing world at a time when we have the greatest need to understand and apply systems science.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, the background provides a brief history of structural equation modeling as it relates to this paper, prior efforts to link SD and SEM, and efforts to develop a unified framework for simulation models.",
        "Next, we provide an overview of our approach to developing a general model, which begins by addressing some preliminary differences between SD and SEM.",
        "We then develop set of conventions and general mathematical framework to include SEM models.",
        "We then provides several examples of SD and SEM models using this general framework, and close with a discussion of some of the limitations, next steps, and implications.",
        "In this section, we provide a brief history of SEM and relevant threads of prior work to develop a general framework for simulation modeling.",
        "We then discuss several conceptual barriers that have arguably contributed to the difficulties of bridging SD and SEM research and the unavoidable a prior.",
        "Structural equation modeling (SEM) brings together two main components, a structural latent causal model and a measurement model, from factor analysis and path analysis in statistics.",
        "Charles Spearman (1904) is credited with constructing the first factor model, which laid the foundations for measuring latent variables (Spearman, 1904; Tarka, 2018).",
        "In his work, he proposed a general ability factor, which he called g, that influences performance on disparate cognitive ability measures (Tarka, 2018).",
        "Sewell Wright (1918), a geneticist, was the originator of path analysis (Wright, 1921).",
        "In his work, he laid out an analytical strategy for imposing a causal structure to describing causal relationships between measures, and developed path diagrams to graphically depict the relationships between measures in these analyses (Tarka, 2018).",
        "Following these origins, SEM has grown due to social scientists and other academics looking to understand the structure of latent phenomena and relationships amongst latent and observed phenomena (Tarka, 2018).",
        "As latent variable models have become more complex, the advancement of latent variable software such as MPlus (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2012) has played a prominent role in the accessibility of SEM.",
        "Prior efforts to link system dynamics modeling involving systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations with structural equation modeling work by Hovmand (2003) and Hovmand and Chalise (2015), however, these efforts were targeted to address more specific questions and limited to illustrative examples as opposed to a general framework.",
        "Related work outside system dynamics has mostly focused on trying to estimate parameters in ordinary differential equation models as dynamical systems using nonlinear regression (e.g., Archontoulis and Miguez, 2015) and structural equation modeling (e.g., Boker and Wenger, 2007).",
        "However, these methods largly focus on estimating parameters using the solution to a system of differential equations as opposed to the underlying causal structure.",
        "Levine et al\u2019s (1992) effort to trace the effects of perturbation through path analysis with feedback loops is an approach similar to the popular MITRE Corporation\u2019s Loopy (2021) online tool, however, both do this without accumulations which can lead to misleading inferences on the dynamic behavior of conserved systems.",
        "Schweppe\u2019s (1973) work on uncertain dynamic systems provides a general approach uncertain dynamic systems including both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives, static and dynamic systems, discrete and continuous time systems, and linear and nonlinear systems.",
        "Schweppe\u2019s mathematical framework considers these as a Bayesian linear model with 16 extensions and special cases.",
        "However, Schweppe\u2019s focus is more on the general estimation problem in uncertain dynamic systems as opposed to seeking to build a bridge between system dynamics and structural equation modeling as methods for representing causal systems.",
        "There have also been efforts to unify approaches to computer simulation modeling.",
        "For example, Zeigler (1976) presented a general mathematical framework for different types of computer simulation modeling, e.g., discrete event simulation, continuous time simulation, etc.",
        "And, several software packages integrate different modeling paradigms, the most notable effort in system dynamics being AnyLogic which support system dynamics simulation modeling, discrete event simulation, and agent based modeling within the same integrated platform.",
        "These efforts focus mostly on the implementation of computer simulation as an applied mathematics or computer science problem and make contributions to the development of simulation software, but do not provide the general mathematical framework for understanding systems using system dynamics or structural equation modeling.",
        "That is, these efforts help address some of the divisions between approaches to computational modeling, but not the larger divide between computational modeling and statistical modeling.",
        "Our approach is to develop a common mathematical framework for bridging system dynamics (SD) modeling as a method with structural equation modeling (SEM).",
        "To do this, we first deal with conceptual barriers in interdisciplinary collaborations between SD and SEM.",
        "Table 1 provides a summary of conceptual differences between SD and SEM features, which will elaborated on in the next section as preliminary concepts before presenting our general framework.",
        "These differences are issues we will need to address in developing our general framework.",
        "Table 1.",
        "Summary of conceptual differences between SD and SEMIt is important to note, first, that the way we resolve these is to develop a common mathematical framework as opposed to the most parsimonious way of describing either method alone.",
        "Second, we focus on a common framework that generally covers the usual models from SD and SEM as opposed to a creative way that a method can be embedded within another.",
        "For example, system dynamics simulation software can be used to simulate a discrete set of observations and generate results that appear similar to the observed covariance matrices that form the basis of structural equation modeling.",
        "While such tricks may satisfy a specific application, they do not provide a general mathematical framework nor lead to a better understanding of how the two approaches are related.",
        "In SD, the primary goal is to develop an explanation for a dynamic behavior pattern of interest that is usually represented as a behavior over time graph and often referred to as the reference mode.",
        "In contrast, the primary goal of SEM is to estimate the effects and predict an observed covariance matrix from the implied covariance matrix of a causal model.",
        "Differences between the goals of the two methods arguably sit within a broader context of concerns about scientific methods, especially as this applies to social systems where the ontology of socially constructed systems (Berger and Luckmann, 1966) requires a scientific strategy that places a greater emphasis on theory appraisal before committing to statistical tests of propositions (Lakatos, 1970; Meehl, 1990).",
        "SD is essentially about solving the inverse problem of finding a plausible system of feedback mechanisms that can generate the dynamic behavior pattern being studied and the associated parameters of a model whereas SEM is primarily about solving the forward problem of predicting the effects from a given model.",
        "The distinction between solving the forward problem versus the inverse problem is nontrivial.",
        "In the forward problem, the goal is to predict a response variable based on a model of predictor variables.",
        "For example, in y = a + b \u22c5 x y=a+b\\cdot x , y y is the response variable, and x x is the predictor variable with a a and b b constants.",
        "This can be simplified into a functional description as y = f \u200b ( x , a , b ) y=f(x,a,b) .",
        "When focused on inverse problems, the goal is fundamentally different where we want to find the function f f where y = f \u200b ( x , a , b ) y=f(x,a,b) .",
        "That is, we are less concerned with how well our identified function f f that maps ( x , a , b ) (x,a,b) onto y y fits, and more interested in which functions, if any, could do this.",
        "Confusion often arises in interdisciplinary conversations trying to understand SD results when people ask how the parameters or strength of the effects in causal relationships are determined.",
        "From the perspective of SD, there are lots of ways to assign a value to a parameter or causal relationship in a system dynamics model including grounding parameters empirically using a range of mixed methods.",
        "(i.e., from Delphi methods with experts to numerical estimates derived from meta-analysis) and stating Bayesian priors.",
        "However, the question is often misplaced because SD is focused on solving the inverse problem of finding plausible systems of differential equations and parameters that could explain the dynamics of the reference mode, not the forward problem of estimating the parameters and the effects of a model, which is often the primary concern in areas such epidemiology and biostatistics.",
        "What we ultimately want to do is show these two methods of solving the inverse problem and forward problem are complementary, not an either/or, and understanding this is essential for gaining a better grasp of the complexity of social systems for developing and sustaining a strong progressive program of research (Lakatos, 1970).",
        "System dynamics is essentially about finding a set of causal feedback relationships that can generate a given behavior pattern of interest, that is, solving the inverse problem as opposed to the forward problem of predicting what will happen given a set of causal relationships.",
        "System dynamics models are typically represented as either a causal loop diagram or a stock and flow diagram (Figures 1a and 1b) whereas structural equation models use path diagrams (Figure 1c).",
        "Although appearing similar, the conventions differ.",
        "For example, system dynamics models focus on identifying the set of balancing and reinforcing loops with loop labels using a B prefix for balancing loops and R prefix for reinforcing loops, whereas structural equation models generally do not even include explicit labels for feedback when they appear as cycles or non-recursive relationships as shown in Figure 1c.",
        "More significant is the fact that structural equation models make an explicit distinction between (1) latent or unobserved variables as circles or ovals and (2) indicators or observed variables as rectangles (Figure 1c).",
        "In system dynamics, the main distinction is between stocks and flows, as shown in a stock and flow diagram (Figure 1b) where rectangles represent accumulations or stocks, and circles represent converters that include rates of change or flows (shown in Figure 1b with a value), endogenous variables, and exogenous variables and constant parameters.",
        "Causal loop diagrams generally do not make a visual distinction between stocks and flows and therefore drop the use of circles and rectangles altogether.",
        "System dynamics explicitly call out exogenous parameters in a model, e.g., \u03b2 \u200b 1 \\beta 1 and \u03b2 \u200b 2 \\beta 2 in Figures 1a and 1b, however, structural equation models generally do not because these are to be estimated by fitting the specified model to data.",
        "Meanwhile, standard structural equation models will generally include not only the indicators ( X \u200b 1 X1 , X \u200b 2 X2 , X \u200b 3 X3 , and X \u200b 4 X4 ) and their corresponding error terms in the measurement model ( \u03b5 \u200b 1 \\varepsilon 1 , \u03b5 \u200b 2 \\varepsilon 2 , \u03b5 \u200b 3 \\varepsilon 3 , and \u03b5 \u200b 4 \\varepsilon 4 ) (Figure 1c).",
        "1 1 1 Note that extensions of the standard SEM model allow for error terms to be correlated.",
        "Adding to the confusion is that the relationship between causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and stock and flow diagrams (SFDs) in system dynamics is often ambiguous when going from a CLD to an SFD, but exact when going from an SFD to a CLD because CLDs are often conceptualized without explicitly identifying the accumulations and their corresponding flows.",
        "Figure 1a comes from drawing the CLD based on the SFD shown in Figure 1b.",
        "However, there are often numerous ways to translate a CLD into a SFD (Figure 1a being an exception by explicitly identifying the rate of change as d \u200b X dX for the variable X X which would imply that X X is an accumulation or stock variable).",
        "The ambiguity of CLDs concerning their translation into SFDs leads some to caution against their use in system dynamics because they contribute to errors in conceptualizing systems and interpreting the behavior of systems (Richardson, 1997).",
        "Nonetheless, CLDs remain a popular choice in systems thinking because the diagramming conventions are often seen as easier to learn and use, especially when the goal is not to develop a formal system dynamics computer simulation model.",
        "Moreover, their similarity to the causal structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and latent causal structures in path diagrams have encouraged statisticians and more recently data scientists to view CLDs as an extension of DAGs, usually without recognizing some of their limitations and appreciating the significance of accumulations in feedback systems.",
        "We will need to address these differences in formulating a general SD-SEM framework by defining a set of diagramming conventions that highlight the homomorphism of symbols between the two approaches.",
        "To do this, we will ultimately show an SD and SEM version of each system for each of the subsequent examples in hopes that this will enable readers trained in one approach to follow the argument and see the connection to the other approach.",
        "System dynamics and structural equation modeling deal with two entirely different sets of equations.",
        "System dynamics builds on a framework of nonlinear differential equations, which have an causal system represented by a system of differential equations, and an analytic or numerically approximated solution using computer simulation.",
        "Structural equation modeling uses a system of linear equations to represent the causal system and measurement model, which can be generalized to include nonlinear interaction terms, and an implied covariance matrix.",
        "Confusions arise between structural equation modeling and system dynamics modeling because people tend to either (1) associate the causal system of differential equations in SD with the linear equations representing the latent causal structure in SEM, or (2) associate the solution to the system of differential equations in SD with implied covariance matrix in SEM.",

        "This confusion gets compounded when longitudinal observations are recorded and analyzed by their position in a longitudinal sequence (i.e., y 1 , y 2 , \u2026 , y k y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{k} ) as opposed to their actual time of data collection (i.e., y \u200b ( t 1 ) , y \u200b ( t 2 ) , \u2026 , y \u200b ( t k ) y(t_{1}),y(t_{2}),...,y(t_{k}) ).",

        "This has implications for how we handle measurement error in developing a general framework because we need to consider both the measurement error associated with the value and time when bringing discrete observations into a measurement model for system dynamics.",
        "Approaches to measures of fit between models and observations differ considerably between system dynamics and structural equation modeling both in their respective practices and development.",
        "Whereas structural equation modeling has placed a strong emphasis on developing and critically using both global and local measures of fit along with standard reporting guidelines that emphasize multiple measures versus relying on a single measure, system dynamics has not.",
        "For example, despite an insistence by Sterman (2000) to provide an assessment of fit and decompose the error using Theil inequality statistics, most published system dynamics models still do not report as a matter of standard practice their fit with observed reference modes.",
        "While this might be attributed to differences between the underlying goal of modeling in system dynamics and structural equation modeling and greater reliance on measures of fit in structural equation modeling for selecting and refining models, there is essentially no excuse in system dynamics for not providing model assessments of fit even if these are known to be weak confidence building tests.",
        "We will return to measures in fit as the general model we propose allows for drawing on work in structural equation modeling and specifically, ways to leverage the newer methods in system dynamics for predicting link and loop scores as a basis for formulating structural equation models that solve the forward problem of prediction.",
        "SD models are inherently under-determined, meaning that no set of observations will uniquely identify the system dynamics model and parameters.",
        "There is, in fact, an infinite set of models and parameters to consider.",
        "However, SD does not rely on numeric data alone to identify a model and recognizes that in social systems, people are also actors and observers of systems and hence have subjective qualitative knowledge about the structure of the system and decision rules within the bounded rationality of experience (e.g., Forrester, 1980; Sterman, 2000).",
        "SD models in this sense are not uniquely identified in the numeric sense, but given that the goal is to solve the inverse problem, that is also not critical.",
        "The focus on solving the forward problem in SEM means the model needs to be identifiable, and hence models in SEM need to be identifiable in their specification, which emphasizes developing and using heuristics such as the minimum number of indicators per latent variables and concerns about the number of observations where models in SEM may be uniquely determined or overdetermined.",
        "This section presents the overall framework from the perspective of the system dynamics modeling process where we start with a reference mode, followed by the diagramming conventions we will use for our framework, and then the general mathematical form of the proposed SD-SEM framework with some examples.",
        "The concept of a reference mode is unique to system dynamics and often misunderstood outside the field along with the significance of defining a reference mode for understanding systems.",
        "A reference mode is a formal statement of the focal dynamic problem or issue of interest which can be stated in words, but more typically as a graph of system behavior over time (e.g., Richardson and Pugh, 1986).",
        "Reference modes can consist of one or more variables over time, but typically only a few variables at most as the goal is to focus the problem or issue down to a few variables.",
        "This effort to focus the problem on a few variables over a specific time horizon is a form of problem structuring, and something that distinguishes system dynamics from more general systems thinking and causal mapping that often involve many variables and feedback loops without consideration of a reference mode.",
        "Hence, central to modeling a feedback system in defining a reference mode is the selection of the time horizon of the reference mode because this essentially limits which feedback loops and accumulations are going to be relevant for the investigation.",
        "In the real system, dynamic phenomena are occurring simultaneously at multiple scales from the smallest interval of time of 10 \u2212 43 10^{-43} seconds (i.e., Planck time) to billions of years (i.e., Eons).",
        "However, defining the time horizon in a reference mode gives us a temporal lens to view view the dynamics and relevant feedback loops and accumulations.",
        "It is important to note that reference modes as problem structuring are idealized abstractions of the system behavior that is of interest and hence not identical with the longitudinal or time series data, nor restricted to what data are available.",
        "That said, reference modes should be empirically grounded.",
        "Building a model to solve a dynamic problem that is not supported by data risks solving fictional problems.",
        "There are too many real problems in the world to work on that can benefit from system dynamics insights to be chasing problems that are not grounded in reality.",
        "The type of data that might be used to support a reference mode can range from qualitative graphs over time elicited through group model building workshops to longitudinal data and intensive time series numeric data.",
        "A key methodological decision in system dynamics is selecting the appropriate time horizon and variables for defining the reference mode, and hence questions arise about the implications of choosing a different time horizon or having more variables as part of the reference mode.",
        "Other issues arise as well in how we empirically ground a reference mode, especially when using subjective qualitative recalling trends over time or rely on a limited number observations over time with measurement error.",
        "In our framework, we distinguish the observed data over time \ud835\udc1b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \\mathbf{b(t)} from our reference mode \ud835\udc2b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \\mathbf{r(t)} where the claim is that \ud835\udc2b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \u2248 \ud835\udc1b \u200b ( \ud835\udc2d ) \\mathbf{r(t)}\\approx\\mathbf{b(t)} .",

        "Note that we could have alternative definitions of our dynamic problem even on this time scale, focusing on the overall trend instead of including the damped oscillation or focusing on only the oscillation as opposed to the declining trend.",

        "However, system dynamics models are continuous in time and the delays between observations and latent indicators are continuous, i.e., they are not restricted to incremental delays between discrete observations (and rarely are).",
        "To address this, we introduce the term \u03b8 \u2208 [ 0 , + \u221e ] \\theta\\in[0,+\\infty] to represent the delay between the observation z i z_{i} and value of the latent variable where the expression x j \u200b ( t k \u2212 \u03b8 i , j ) x_{j}(t_{k}-\\theta_{i,j}) means the value of x j x_{j} at t k t_{k} delayed by \u03b8 i , j \\theta_{i,j} for x j x_{j} .",
        "Similar to our assumption that measurement errors for an indicator are constant across time, we make the simplifying assumption that the delays \u03b8 i \\theta_{i} are also constant across time.",

        "The general model (Table 2) defines a set of functions that maps a model specification into a data frame or matrix of observed variables over time.",
        "The generality of the approach means that various models from system dynamics and structural equation modeling can be mapped into the same general model.",
        "We illustrate this by showing how two standard models, one from system dynamics and another from structural equation modeling, can be represented in this general model.",
        "From this, one can represent a wide range of both system dynamics and structural equation models including hybrid models that bring the two approaches together in more interesting ways.",
        "The main contribution is not, however, to suggest a parsimonious synthesis of the two approaches, but rather, to define a mathematical space that can be used to systematically generate and compare methods for causal modeling over well-defined distributions of systems.",
        "That a mathematical space is complicated shouldn\u2019t be surprising, but that it can be characterized at all within a relatively finite and small set of dimensions that we suspect can cover most of the usual cases in both methods is interesting.",
        "Complicated, yes, but not a bridge between two methods that is impossible to build.",
        "Defining the mathematical space for bridging these two methods provides a means to generate systems in a systematic way and conduct simulation studies to explore the implications of various assumptions on causal inferences from modeling and data.",
        "This becomes even more critical today when we consider the implications of implementing AI/ML models in systems that impact society because, more than ever before, we need to understand how the assumptions we make and hence our biases might translate into a algorithmic biases.",
        "Presently, we have ideas about how we might be able to mitigate some of these biases and arrive at more accurate and ethical models using causal maps and system dynamics in particular, but without a solid understanding of how methods relate, we are at risk of blindly letting the unavoidable a priori be an excuse for the \u201cunintended\u201d consequences of harm caused by poorly designed AI/ML.",
        "If one of the main contributions of system dynamics is to help us think better about the dynamically complex systems we are in and trying to manage, and our method is grounded in a deep mathematical understanding of our natural and social world as dynamic, it behooves us as a discipline to seek out and mathematically reconcile differences with other methods.",

Understanding the dynamics of systems in SD emphasizes developing an explicit explanation of the structure-behavior relationship in a system, that is, understanding how the dynamics of a system are generated by a set of interacting nonlinear balancing and reinforcing feedback mechanisms. In this section, we provide a brief history of SEM and relevant threads of prior work to develop a general framework for simulation modeling. We then discuss several conceptual barriers that have arguably contributed to the difficulties of bridging SD and SEM research and the unavoidable a prior. This section presents the overall framework from the perspective of the system dynamics modeling process where we start with a reference mode, followed by the diagramming conventions we will use for our framework, and then the general mathematical form of the proposed SD-SEM framework with some examples. The concept of a reference mode is unique to system dynamics and often misunderstood outside the field along with the significance of defining a reference mode for understanding systems. In this section, we provide a few illustrative examples of how to specify various models using our proposed general model. The first illustrates the \u201cLimits to Growth\u201d system dynamics model and the second the \u201cIndustrialization and Political Democracy\u201d structural equation model. In this paper, we have highlighted the differences between structural equation modeling and system dynamics, and then sought to develop a general framework in an effort to bridge the \u201cunavoidable a priori\u201d between two different approaches to causal modeling. The general model (Table 2) defines a set of functions that maps a model specification into a data frame or matrix of observed variables over time.

        "paragraphs": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on an expanding range of tasks. Successive models exhibit increasingly sophisticated capabilities [ openai_gpt5_syscard_web_2025 , gemini2025 ] , yet their evaluation still centers largely on mathematics and code generation benchmarks [ Hendrycks2020MMLU , balunovic2025matharena , Jimenez2023SWEBench ] . This narrow focus leaves the dynamic, multi-step processes of reasoning and planning under-examined. When these abilities are studied directly, progress is often far less convincing than in other domains [ Valmeekam2025ASystematicEvaluationofthePlanning , chollet2025arcprize , nezhurina2025aliceinwonder ] . These limitations hinder the deployment of LLMs in complex, real-world applications that demand robust planning and state tracking, such as autonomous agents [ Liu2023AgentBench ] .\nAlthough LLMs can often solve such problems by writing or calling basic search code, our goal here is to isolate their intrinsic planning and state-tracking abilities without such tools. We therefore ask a concrete question: how well can LLMs plan and reason over an evolving state when they cannot rely on code execution or other external tools? To answer this, we use the standard 8-puzzle and ask models to solve random configurations of the game. The 8-puzzle requires models to maintain an accurate representation of the board, obey strict move validity constraints, and choose moves that eventually reach a goal state. We measure not only whether a puzzle is solved but also how and why runs terminate when they fail, to understand the limits of model performance on this type of task.\nWe investigate the performance of four models\u2014GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Pro, GPT-5-mini, and Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct\u2014on 8-puzzle instances with varying optimal solution lengths, using three common prompting strategies: Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought [ wei2022cot , yu2023bettercot ] , and Algorithm-of-Thought [ sel2024aot ] . Under each prompting strategy, each model receives a single attempt per puzzle. We then further assist the models on puzzles they initially fail to solve by allowing three additional attempts per level of feedback (repeat, specific, and suggestive). Within each feedback level, we save progress between calls. With these additional attempts, we observe more success under some conditions for particular models (GPT-5-Thinking with AoT and suggestive feedback). However, no single approach performs best across models, and the improvements are slow and costly. The final intervention we investigate is an external move validator that offloads the burden of determining move validity. The models no longer have to decide which moves are valid and which are not; we provide them with a list of all valid moves and ask them to return the best one. We then apply the move, update the board state and list, and reprompt the model. Despite this assistance, no model solves any puzzles.\nAcross models and conditions, two dominant deficits emerge: fallible representations of the board state, leading to invalid moves, and weak heuristic planning, leading to loops or moves that do not advance the puzzle toward the goal state. This work moves beyond aggregate performance metrics to offer a granular, qualitative analysis of why LLMs struggle with such tasks and how different interventions modulate these failures. Our contributions can be summarized as:\nA tool-free 8-puzzle evaluation across four LLMs under Zero-Shot, CoT and AoT prompting and tiered feedback, with a common protocol that isolates the effects of prompting versus feedback.\nA fine-grained failure-mode analysis with per-condition breakdowns, revealing how and why models terminate instead of only reporting success rates.\nAn external move validator condition that eliminates the need to determine which moves are valid, isolating planning capabilities and quantifying each model\u2019s ability to work toward a goal when state tracking is no longer the bottleneck.",

        "title": "3 Methods",
        "paragraphs": "The 8-puzzle is a simple and widely used search problem in AI [ russell2020aima , complete8puzzle ] . The puzzle consists of a 3-by-3 grid with eight numbered, sliding tiles (1\u20138) and a single blank space (represented as 0). Tiles directly adjacent to the space can slide into it to change the board configuration. From a random starting configuration, the goal is to slide tiles until the board reads 1\u20138 from left to right, top to bottom, with the blank in the bottom-right corner. The 8-puzzle is particularly well-suited to our investigation because it is a well-studied problem in AI [ russell2020aima ] , it provides a controllable and predictable environment in which the model must track the board state and obey strict rules, and it demands non-trivial long-term planning because solutions are unlikely to be found through local or random actions alone. Thus, it combines state tracking and planning in a single, compact domain, with easily verifiable solutions and unambiguous instructions.\nThe problem space consists of 181,440 unique solvable configurations, with the shortest optimal solution requiring zero moves and the longest optimal solution requiring 31 moves [ complete8puzzle ] . To ensure fair representation of puzzles with varying difficulty, we divided them into difficulty bins based on their optimal solution lengths. Each bin represents roughly 20% of the solvable puzzles and contains 10 sampled puzzles (see Fig. 3 for the bin definition). We generated the puzzles for each bin by creating a flattened list of integers from 0 to 8, shuffling them with Python\u2019s random.shuffle , and reshaping them into 3-by-3 arrays. For each bin, we repeatedly sampled random boards and used only those that were solvable according to the standard parity test. Given the large number of possible puzzles and their random generation, we minimize the likelihood of data contamination.\nWe tested four models in our experiments: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Pro, GPT-5-mini and Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct. To ensure uniformity and fairness between models, we used the same parameters and prompts for all four models: a token limit of 64,000, a time limit of 1,800 seconds per response, a temperature of 1.0, and identical system prompts. We set the temperature to 1.0 because the GPT-5 models do not allow variation from this value. Furthermore, a temperature of 1.0 is consistent with previous work [ shojaee2025illusion ] , and even when variation is allowed, temperatures of 0.0 are not always deterministic with OpenAI models [ Valmeekam2025ASystematicEvaluationofthePlanning ] . To control API costs, especially for the larger models, we evaluated all models on the same set of 50 puzzles, consistent with prior work [ shojaee2025illusion ] .\nWe study three prompting regimes under a common setup: Zero-Shot (no examples or reasoning cues), CoT (three worked examples encouraging stepwise reasoning), and AoT (three examples implementing a simple Manhattan-style search). The CoT and AoT prompts use the same three example boards, differing only in the reasoning styles they demonstrate. These three approaches serve as our base conditions , on which we build all subsequent attempts with and without feedback.\nOur Zero-Shot prompt provides only the 8-puzzle rules, goal state, and output format, without examples or reasoning cues like \"think step-by-step\" [ kojima2022zeroshotcot ] . This setup isolates the model\u2019s baseline reasoning and planning abilities and serves as a control to benchmark unguided performance against CoT and AoT interventions. We illustrate this setup in Fig. 1 .\nCoT is a prompting approach that often enhances LLM problem-solving by instructing the model to generate intermediate steps [ wei2022cot , yu2023bettercot , wang2023understandingcot ] . We provided additional assistance using the few-shot paradigm, designing a 3-shot CoT prompt that gives the model a diverse set of worked examples. We chose three examples to limit prompt length and because prior work suggests that performance gains tend to diminish beyond a few examples [ wei2022cot , kojima2022zeroshotcot ] . Our selected examples feature diverse board configurations and, critically, showcase complete solutions of varying lengths\u20143, 5, and 6 moves\u2014and slightly different strategies to teach the model flexible and adaptive reasoning. The full prompt is available in Appendix A.2 .\nAlgorithm-of-Thought works by guiding a language model to follow explicit algorithmic reasoning steps\u2014often structured like pseudocode or formal rules\u2014so that its outputs mimic systematic, step-by-step problem solving rather than free-form reasoning [ sel2024aot ] . The original work reports improvements across many tasks and shows that AoT can outperform other prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [ wei2022cot ] and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [ yao2023treeofthoughts , sel2024aot ] . For our work, we specify a simple Manhattan-style search\u2014similar to A*\u2014and again provide the same three example boards to stay consistent with the CoT prompt and ensure a fair comparison between approaches. For further details on the AoT prompt, see Appendix A.3 .\nFor each puzzle that a model failed to solve on its first attempt under any condition (Zero-Shot, CoT, or AoT), we ran three independent feedback trials: a repeat control, a trial with specific feedback, and one with suggestive feedback, as shown in Fig. 2 . All three feedback trials start from the same failure state and have up to three additional attempts to solve the puzzle. That is, within a given trial, the attempt k + 1 k{+}1 resumes from the furthest valid state reached in the attempt k k . Concretely, if model M M failed puzzle i i under AoT (even if it passed under Zero-Shot or CoT), we re-prompted M M with the AoT system prompt for up to three attempts under each feedback condition: repeat (no feedback), specific feedback, and suggestive feedback.\nBy furthest valid state we mean the last board configuration before failure: for invalid_move , where the model moves a tile off the board or one that is not adjacent to the space, or loop_detected , where the model repeats a board configuration, we resume from the state immediately before the offending move. If the model fails due to an early_stop , where it makes only valid moves but stops before reaching the goal state, we resume from the state after the last move. We reset the visited-state set at the start of each attempt. Attempts stop early upon success; otherwise, they terminate due to a timeout, token limit, early stop, loop, invalid move, or graceful failure, in which the model either refuses to solve the problem or asks for clarification on how to do so. We cap retries at three per feedback condition (repeat, specific, and suggestive) to align with prior work on iterative LLM correction [ madaan2023selfrefine ] and to limit API costs. Across feedback conditions, we keep the system prompt and hyperparameters fixed.\nAs a control condition, we re-prompt the model from the furthest valid state of its last failed attempt without providing any feedback. The prompt presents this state as a new, standalone puzzle. This trial serves as a baseline to measure performance gains arising purely from model stochasticity and from an additional attempt, thereby isolating the effects of the feedback provided under other conditions.\nSpecific feedback also resumes from the furthest valid state, but provides precise details on the previous failed attempt. If the model makes an invalid move, we inform it of the error and identify the specific tile involved. If it exceeds the time limit, we specify the exact duration allowed. We designed this level to help the model avoid immediately repeating the same mistake and to highlight where it went wrong so it can correct its behaviour. For example, highlighting that the model made an invalid move should encourage it to focus more on tracking the state space.\nSuggestive feedback includes all elements of Specific feedback, plus a scalar hint: the optimal solution length for the current board. We computed this value exactly using Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) with the admissible Manhattan-distance heuristic. Because the Manhattan heuristic is admissible (and consistent) for the 8-puzzle, the returned length equals the true optimum. We reveal only the length x x \u2014never the action sequence\u2014and append: \u201cHint: The optimal solution has x x moves. Your solution may be longer, but try to find an efficient path.\u201d The hint provides a progress signal while still leaving planning to the model, aiming to prevent it from undertaking an unnecessarily long search. We illustrate this level of feedback in Fig. 2 .\nIn our final intervention, we offload part of the state-tracking burden from the model. The model receives the current puzzle state along with two lists: one containing all valid moves from the current position and another containing the previous move to help it avoid loops (e.g., immediately reversing the last action). This setup removes the need for the model to determine which moves are valid; it only has to examine the puzzle and select the best next move from the list. We instruct the model to return a single move, which we then apply to the puzzle. After applying the move, we update the puzzle state and move lists and re-query the model. Since the longest optimal solution for any 8-puzzle instance is 31 moves and roughly 94% of puzzles require 26 or fewer moves, we allow the models to take up to 50 moves per puzzle, providing ample opportunity to solve it while avoiding excessively long, run-on trajectories.",

            "paragraphs": "The 8-puzzle is a simple and widely used search problem in AI [ russell2020aima , complete8puzzle ] . The puzzle consists of a 3-by-3 grid with eight numbered, sliding tiles (1\u20138) and a single blank space (represented as 0). Tiles directly adjacent to the space can slide into it to change the board configuration. From a random starting configuration, the goal is to slide tiles until the board reads 1\u20138 from left to right, top to bottom, with the blank in the bottom-right corner. The 8-puzzle is particularly well-suited to our investigation because it is a well-studied problem in AI [ russell2020aima ] , it provides a controllable and predictable environment in which the model must track the board state and obey strict rules, and it demands non-trivial long-term planning because solutions are unlikely to be found through local or random actions alone. Thus, it combines state tracking and planning in a single, compact domain, with easily verifiable solutions and unambiguous instructions.\nThe problem space consists of 181,440 unique solvable configurations, with the shortest optimal solution requiring zero moves and the longest optimal solution requiring 31 moves [ complete8puzzle ] . To ensure fair representation of puzzles with varying difficulty, we divided them into difficulty bins based on their optimal solution lengths. Each bin represents roughly 20% of the solvable puzzles and contains 10 sampled puzzles (see Fig. 3 for the bin definition). We generated the puzzles for each bin by creating a flattened list of integers from 0 to 8, shuffling them with Python\u2019s random.shuffle , and reshaping them into 3-by-3 arrays. For each bin, we repeatedly sampled random boards and used only those that were solvable according to the standard parity test. Given the large number of possible puzzles and their random generation, we minimize the likelihood of data contamination.",

            "paragraphs": "For each puzzle that a model failed to solve on its first attempt under any condition (Zero-Shot, CoT, or AoT), we ran three independent feedback trials: a repeat control, a trial with specific feedback, and one with suggestive feedback, as shown in Fig. 2 . All three feedback trials start from the same failure state and have up to three additional attempts to solve the puzzle. That is, within a given trial, the attempt k + 1 k{+}1 resumes from the furthest valid state reached in the attempt k k . Concretely, if model M M failed puzzle i i under AoT (even if it passed under Zero-Shot or CoT), we re-prompted M M with the AoT system prompt for up to three attempts under each feedback condition: repeat (no feedback), specific feedback, and suggestive feedback.\nBy furthest valid state we mean the last board configuration before failure: for invalid_move , where the model moves a tile off the board or one that is not adjacent to the space, or loop_detected , where the model repeats a board configuration, we resume from the state immediately before the offending move. If the model fails due to an early_stop , where it makes only valid moves but stops before reaching the goal state, we resume from the state after the last move. We reset the visited-state set at the start of each attempt. Attempts stop early upon success; otherwise, they terminate due to a timeout, token limit, early stop, loop, invalid move, or graceful failure, in which the model either refuses to solve the problem or asks for clarification on how to do so. We cap retries at three per feedback condition (repeat, specific, and suggestive) to align with prior work on iterative LLM correction [ madaan2023selfrefine ] and to limit API costs. Across feedback conditions, we keep the system prompt and hyperparameters fixed.\nAs a control condition, we re-prompt the model from the furthest valid state of its last failed attempt without providing any feedback. The prompt presents this state as a new, standalone puzzle. This trial serves as a baseline to measure performance gains arising purely from model stochasticity and from an additional attempt, thereby isolating the effects of the feedback provided under other conditions.\nSpecific feedback also resumes from the furthest valid state, but provides precise details on the previous failed attempt. If the model makes an invalid move, we inform it of the error and identify the specific tile involved. If it exceeds the time limit, we specify the exact duration allowed. We designed this level to help the model avoid immediately repeating the same mistake and to highlight where it went wrong so it can correct its behaviour. For example, highlighting that the model made an invalid move should encourage it to focus more on tracking the state space.\nSuggestive feedback includes all elements of Specific feedback, plus a scalar hint: the optimal solution length for the current board. We computed this value exactly using Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) with the admissible Manhattan-distance heuristic. Because the Manhattan heuristic is admissible (and consistent) for the 8-puzzle, the returned length equals the true optimum.

        "paragraphs": "Initial experiments established a performance baseline across all four models using Zero-Shot, CoT, and AoT prompting. The results, summarized in Fig. 4 , reveal that successful puzzle completion was rare for most models. GPT-5-Thinking was the only model to achieve a modest success rate, with 30% of puzzles solved under the AoT condition. This result represents the highest performance recorded in this phase, outperforming the next-best attempt (its own CoT performance) by eight percentage points.\nIn contrast to GPT-5-Thinking, the other models struggled significantly. Gemini-2.5-Pro and Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct were almost entirely unsuccessful, with Gemini solving only a single puzzle under the Zero-Shot condition and Llama solving none. The primary failure mode of these models is invalid moves across all prompting strategies, except Llama with CoT, which had a spike in parse errors because there was no list to extract from its answers. Interestingly, GPT-5-mini outperformed Gemini-2.5-Pro by solving more puzzles overall and at least one puzzle under each condition. GPT-5-mini also demonstrated a notable divergence from GPT-5-Thinking; its Zero-Shot performance was comparable to GPT-5-Thinking\u2019s at an 8% success rate. However, unlike its more capable counterpart, introducing more complex CoT and AoT prompts did not improve performance, as its success rate dropped under both approaches. With GPT-5-mini, we also see, in both CoT and AoT, a sharp increase in graceful failure, where the model refuses to continue or requests clarification.\nReviewing success rates by difficulty, as shown in Fig. 3 , we observe that success does not decrease monotonically with optimal solution length. Although all models struggle with the longest puzzles, some achieve or match their best performance in the moderate-length bins. For example, GPT-5-Thinking with AoT matches its lower bin performance in two of the moderate bins. Similarly, GPT-5-mini, with its CoT prompt, solves no puzzles in the two shortest bins, then jumps up to 10% in the middle one. This pattern points to planning and state-tracking issues, rather than puzzle difficulty alone, as the main determinants of success rates.\nAs shown in Fig. 5 , providing feedback, additional attempts, and saving progress yielded performance gains across all models and prompting strategies, except for Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct. GPT-5-Thinking showed the most significant improvement, with AoT prompting and suggestive feedback yielding a 68% success rate, the best performance for any model. As the level of feedback increased, GPT-5-Thinking\u2019s performance improved with AoT and Zero-Shot, but the opposite occurred with CoT: its performance steadily decreased. We observe the same trend for GPT-5-mini under CoT. These results suggest that more informative feedback may not always be desirable for these models.\nThe other models, excluding Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct, also showed steady gains. Both Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-mini achieved a peak success rate of 18%. Notably, both models achieved this peak under the \"Repeat\" condition (Gemini-2.5-Pro with Zero-Shot and GPT-5-mini with CoT), suggesting that the primary benefit came from saving progress and re-prompting rather than from the feedback content itself. Gemini-2.5-Pro, however, matched this 18% performance when using the combination of AoT prompting and suggestive feedback. GPT-5-mini with CoT, similar to GPT-5-Thinking with CoT, shows a steady decline in performance as the level of feedback increases, again highlighting that more informative feedback is not always beneficial. Finally, at the lowest end of the performance spectrum, Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct failed to solve any puzzles even with feedback, underscoring a significant capability gap on this task.\nIn the final experiment, we aimed to isolate planning abilities by offloading part of the state tracking responsibilities. The results, shown in Fig. 6 , reveal a critical failure in heuristic planning: none of the models solved any puzzles. The dominant failure mode for the models shifts to looping, in which they repeat a move and return to an already visited board configuration. GPT-5-Thinking looped in 100% of trials, with Gemini-2.5-Pro and Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct looping 92% and 86% of the time, respectively. These results suggest that even when presented only with valid moves and the previous move to help track progress, these models struggle to formulate a goal-oriented path.\nGPT-5-mini showed a different kind of limitation: it did not solve any puzzles, but its primary outcome was early termination (68%), meaning it consistently made valid moves until it reached the 50-move limit. Therefore, GPT-5-mini exhibits a different kind of planning deficit: it can make valid moves and track the state space\u2014contrasting with its earlier single-prompt results in Fig. 4 \u2014but lacks a coherent long-term strategy, effectively wandering the state space without direction.",

        "paragraphs": "Our experiments reveal that a diverse range of LLMs, differing in producer and size, continue to struggle with simple planning and search-based tasks such as the 8-puzzle, even SOTA models like GPT-5-Thinking, which has been described as possessing PhD-level intelligence [ openai_introducing_gpt5_2025 ] . Models consistently fail due to two primary deficits: brittle internal state representations that lead to invalid moves and weak heuristic planning that results in loops. These deficits indicate that models often fail to maintain accurate board state representations or to devise effective long-term strategies. This finding underscores a key limitation: while LLMs increasingly excel on academic benchmarks, they remain challenged by sequential tasks that demand sustained planning and state awareness.\nThe prevalence of loop failures is especially revealing because the system prompt explicitly instructs models to avoid repeating moves. Despite this explicit constraint, all models frequently violated the instruction, suggesting a fundamental difficulty in adhering to constraints. This deficit is most apparent in the external move validator experiment: even when given a list of valid moves, an explicit instruction not to repeat moves, and their previous move, the models continued to loop. One might argue that the model\u2019s internal heuristic changes between calls, but even then, it could simply select a different valid move when its preferred choice violates the constraints. Instead, it repeats moves, indicating that the planning process relies not only on weak heuristics but also fails to integrate the prompt\u2019s explicit rules.\nOur experiments suggest that the utility of advanced prompting strategies is model-dependent, as illustrated in Fig. 4 . While Algorithm-of-Thought (AoT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) improved performance for GPT-5-Thinking, they degraded performance for GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Pro. These findings demonstrate that, for this task, the efficacy of a prompting technique is contingent on the model, with no single approach proving universally superior.\nThe effects of prompting extended beyond success rates, causing significant shifts in termination modes (Fig. 4 ). For instance, Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct under the CoT condition exhibited an increase in parse errors, indicating a failure to adhere to the specified output format. Concurrently, GPT-5-mini showed a dramatic increase in graceful failure with both CoT and AoT, in which the model refuses to provide a solution or requests clarification. These outcomes suggest that, for some models, introducing complex prompts creates confusion, hindering their ability to follow instructions rather than aiding their reasoning.\nGPT-5-Thinking saw the most significant performance increase with the addition of feedback and saved progress between calls. Its success rate increased from 30% to 68%, but this comes at a substantial cost. As Table 1 shows, the model needs, on average, two attempts, 24 minutes, over twice as many moves and 75,000 tokens to solve a puzzle. These averages are all higher when we include the puzzles that the models failed to solve. Furthermore, we obtain these results under carefully engineered prompts designed to be as helpful as possible for this task. Thus, while performance may increase, the compute and human resources required to provide these gains are substantial and problem-dependent. Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-mini both have similar issues with resource usage. While their average time, tokens and moves needed are lower overall, they require more attempts and have a substantially lower success rate of 18%.\nIn our final experiment with the external move validator, no model solved a single puzzle. As shown in Fig. 6 , this intervention hurt performance, lowering the success rates of all models and shifting the dominant failure mode to looping in most models and early termination in GPT-5-mini. Fig. 7 further illustrates the planning deficit, showing that the models made minimal progress toward the goal state despite making numerous valid moves. For instance, GPT-5-mini made, on average, nearly forty-seven valid moves to achieve only about six moves of progress based on a Manhattan-distance heuristic. GPT-5-Thinking and Gemini were more efficient in that they made better progress in fewer moves, but this matters little, as they often began to repeat moves, completely stagnating progress. This finding highlights that, even when given only valid moves, models either rely on heuristics so weak that solving a typical puzzle could require well over 100 moves, or they begin repeating moves and cycling through already visited states.\nOur findings, though derived from a single domain, carry significant implications for LLM deployment. We observe that all models struggle with this simple task, and while engineered prompts with feedback and saved-state progression show improvement, they are costly. These interventions also fail to make any model reliable, as none achieves a success rate over 70%. The nature of these failures is also concerning, with the primary deficits not just weak heuristic planning that leads to loops, but also a persistent difficulty in maintaining an accurate representation of the board state, leading to \"hallucinated\" or invalid moves. These errors lead to a critical issue: models frequently output solutions as if they have correctly solved the puzzle, without detecting the mistakes made earlier in the sequence. This kind of false confidence undermines trust, because a model\u2019s final output may rest on undetected errors earlier in the sequence.\nThese findings challenge the vision of deploying LLMs as autonomous agents in complex, real-world applications. If an LLM cannot reliably track its own state in a simple, deterministic puzzle, it may have similar issues in high-stakes, dynamic environments. In domains such as autonomous robotics, financial trading, or logistics management, an agent that proceeds with high confidence after an internal error can be unreliable and potentially dangerous. It risks costly or harmful outcomes by acting on a flawed premise.\nOne might ask why we do not simply allow the models to use code interpreters for this task\u2014after all, using tools is itself a form of reasoning. However, allowing the model to write and execute code changes the nature of the problem: the evaluation then focuses on whether the model can produce valid code, a capability already well studied by existing benchmarks. Moreover, code-based search largely masks planning and state tracking, since an external algorithm can solve the puzzle without the model needing to devise or maintain a long-term strategy. Therefore, in our experiments, we exclude code interpreters because they would mask the abilities we seek to examine.",

            "paragraphs": "Our experiments reveal that a diverse range of LLMs, differing in producer and size, continue to struggle with simple planning and search-based tasks such as the 8-puzzle, even SOTA models like GPT-5-Thinking, which has been described as possessing PhD-level intelligence [ openai_introducing_gpt5_2025 ] . Models consistently fail due to two primary deficits: brittle internal state representations that lead to invalid moves and weak heuristic planning that results in loops. These deficits indicate that models often fail to maintain accurate board state representations or to devise effective long-term strategies. This finding underscores a key limitation: while LLMs increasingly excel on academic benchmarks, they remain challenged by sequential tasks that demand sustained planning and state awareness.\nThe prevalence of loop failures is especially revealing because the system prompt explicitly instructs models to avoid repeating moves. Despite this explicit constraint, all models frequently violated the instruction, suggesting a fundamental difficulty in adhering to constraints. This deficit is most apparent in the external move validator experiment: even when given a list of valid moves, an explicit instruction not to repeat moves, and their previous move, the models continued to loop. One might argue that the model\u2019s internal heuristic changes between calls, but even then, it could simply select a different valid move when its preferred choice violates the constraints. Instead, it repeats moves, indicating that the planning process relies not only on weak heuristics but also fails to integrate the prompt\u2019s explicit rules.",

While Algorithm-of-Thought (AoT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) improved performance for GPT-5-Thinking, they degraded performance for GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Pro. These findings demonstrate that, for this task, the efficacy of a prompting technique is contingent on the model, with no single approach proving universally superior.\nThe effects of prompting extended beyond success rates, causing significant shifts in termination modes (Fig. 4 ). For instance, Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct under the CoT condition exhibited an increase in parse errors, indicating a failure to adhere to the specified output format. Concurrently, GPT-5-mini showed a dramatic increase in graceful failure with both CoT and AoT, in which the model refuses to provide a solution or requests clarification. These outcomes suggest that, for some models, introducing complex prompts creates confusion, hindering their ability to follow instructions rather than aiding their reasoning.",

As Table 1 shows, the model needs, on average, two attempts, 24 minutes, over twice as many moves and 75,000 tokens to solve a puzzle. These averages are all higher when we include the puzzles that the models failed to solve. Furthermore, we obtain these results under carefully engineered prompts designed to be as helpful as possible for this task. Thus, while performance may increase, the compute and human resources required to provide these gains are substantial and problem-dependent. Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-mini both have similar issues with resource usage. While their average time, tokens and moves needed are lower overall, they require more attempts and have a substantially lower success rate of 18%.",

Our findings show that both SOTA and small models still struggle significantly with this seemingly simple task, with failures indicating critical deficits in state tracking and heuristic planning. While feedback and prompt engineering offer some help, they are costly and do not provide the gains needed to make these models reliable. Furthermore, even when offloading some of the burden by providing the model with valid moves and its last move, no model solves any puzzles. The tendency for models to be unaware of their mistakes and to proceed with high confidence after undetected errors poses a substantial risk in real-world settings. These poor success rates underscore a fundamental gap between current LLM capabilities and the reliable, stateful reasoning required for genuine autonomy.",

        "These limitations hinder the deployment of LLMs in complex, real-world applications that demand robust planning and state tracking, such as autonomous agents [ Liu2023AgentBench ] .",
        "Although LLMs can often solve such problems by writing or calling basic search code, our goal here is to isolate their intrinsic planning and state-tracking abilities without such tools.",
        "We therefore ask a concrete question: how well can LLMs plan and reason over an evolving state when they cannot rely on code execution or other external tools?",
        "To answer this, we use the standard 8-puzzle and ask models to solve random configurations of the game.",
        "The 8-puzzle requires models to maintain an accurate representation of the board, obey strict move validity constraints, and choose moves that eventually reach a goal state.",
        "We measure not only whether a puzzle is solved but also how and why runs terminate when they fail, to understand the limits of model performance on this type of task.",
        "We investigate the performance of four models\u2014GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Pro, GPT-5-mini, and Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct\u2014on 8-puzzle instances with varying optimal solution lengths, using three common prompting strategies: Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought [ wei2022cot , yu2023bettercot ] , and Algorithm-of-Thought [ sel2024aot ] .",
        "Under each prompting strategy, each model receives a single attempt per puzzle.",
        "We then further assist the models on puzzles they initially fail to solve by allowing three additional attempts per level of feedback (repeat, specific, and suggestive).",
        "Within each feedback level, we save progress between calls.",
        "With these additional attempts, we observe more success under some conditions for particular models (GPT-5-Thinking with AoT and suggestive feedback).",
        "However, no single approach performs best across models, and the improvements are slow and costly.",
        "The final intervention we investigate is an external move validator that offloads the burden of determining move validity.",
        "The models no longer have to decide which moves are valid and which are not; we provide them with a list of all valid moves and ask them to return the best one.",
        "We then apply the move, update the board state and list, and reprompt the model.",
        "Despite this assistance, no model solves any puzzles.",
        "Across models and conditions, two dominant deficits emerge: fallible representations of the board state, leading to invalid moves, and weak heuristic planning, leading to loops or moves that do not advance the puzzle toward the goal state.",
        "This work moves beyond aggregate performance metrics to offer a granular, qualitative analysis of why LLMs struggle with such tasks and how different interventions modulate these failures.",
        "Our contributions can be summarized as:A tool-free 8-puzzle evaluation across four LLMs under Zero-Shot, CoT and AoT prompting and tiered feedback, with a common protocol that isolates the effects of prompting versus feedback.",

        "A common approach that consistently shows improvement is prompt engineering, where one uses the system prompt to specify how the model should approach a problem.",
        "Chain-of-Thought [ wei2022cot , wang2023understandingcot ] is a familiar example, and it often asks the model to work step-by-step through a task.",
        "Algorithm-of-Thought [ sel2024aot ] is another approach that instructs the model to think like a search algorithm.",
        "Other works seek to decompose the problem [ bi2025forestofthought , yao2023treeofthoughts ] , allowing the model to explore several reasoning branches and then proceed with the most promising one based on a heuristic such as self-critique.",
        "Notably, even with guidance on how models should approach the problem, these methods still rely on the models\u2019 own capabilities to complete the task.",
        "However, other work has offloaded some of the burden from the models when solving problems.",
        "For example, some works improve LLM performance by using tools such as code interpreters, which offload part of the computation to a separate program [ gao2023pal , chen2023pot ] .",
        "Additional work improves model performance by enabling models to access the internet and consult resources such as Wikipedia [ schick2023toolformer , yao2023react ] .",
        "With these extra tools, the models often outperform prompt-only methods.",
        "However, their performance can no longer be attributed solely to the models themselves, as it now depends on external information and computation.",

        "These benchmarks often rely on arithmetic or knowledge-based questions, where success is determined by recalling facts or using similar examples from the training data to solve the problems presented.",
        "However, many studies have examined the possibility of data contamination [ balunovic2025matharena , xu2024bdc , liang2025swebenchillusion ] , raising concerns about the validity of the improvements we observe across models.",
        "Furthermore, these tasks offer less insight into the models\u2019 planning abilities because they rarely require a long-term strategy.",
        "Work that focuses on LLM planning often reports low success rates and provides high-level analyses of why models fail\u2014for example, prompt-sensitive pattern-matching and the need for planner-based repair [ Valmeekam2023OnThePlanningAbilitiesLLMs ] .",
        "Other recent evaluations include cost/efficiency comparisons with some failure-mode breakdowns [ Valmeekam2025ASystematicEvaluationofthePlanning , shojaee2025illusion ] , but they do not typically emphasize fine-grained analyses of how failures unfold.",
        "Furthermore, few studies examine variable levels of feedback, and we are aware of none that systematically combine modern prompting techniques with feedback on a planning task like the 8-puzzle to analyze how these factors modulate performance and failure types, leaving the effects of prompting and feedback on such tasks under-examined.",
        "The 8-puzzle is a simple and widely used search problem in AI [ russell2020aima , complete8puzzle ] .",
        "The puzzle consists of a 3-by-3 grid with eight numbered, sliding tiles (1\u20138) and a single blank space (represented as 0).",
        "Tiles directly adjacent to the space can slide into it to change the board configuration.",
        "From a random starting configuration, the goal is to slide tiles until the board reads 1\u20138 from left to right, top to bottom, with the blank in the bottom-right corner.",
        "The 8-puzzle is particularly well-suited to our investigation because it is a well-studied problem in AI [ russell2020aima ] , it provides a controllable and predictable environment in which the model must track the board state and obey strict rules, and it demands non-trivial long-term planning because solutions are unlikely to be found through local or random actions alone.",
        "Thus, it combines state tracking and planning in a single, compact domain, with easily verifiable solutions and unambiguous instructions.",
        "The problem space consists of 181,440 unique solvable configurations, with the shortest optimal solution requiring zero moves and the longest optimal solution requiring 31 moves [ complete8puzzle ] .",
        "To ensure fair representation of puzzles with varying difficulty, we divided them into difficulty bins based on their optimal solution lengths.",
        "Each bin represents roughly 20% of the solvable puzzles and contains 10 sampled puzzles (see Fig.",
        "3 for the bin definition).",

        "To ensure uniformity and fairness between models, we used the same parameters and prompts for all four models: a token limit of 64,000, a time limit of 1,800 seconds per response, a temperature of 1.0, and identical system prompts.",
        "We set the temperature to 1.0 because the GPT-5 models do not allow variation from this value.",
        "Furthermore, a temperature of 1.0 is consistent with previous work [ shojaee2025illusion ] , and even when variation is allowed, temperatures of 0.0 are not always deterministic with OpenAI models [ Valmeekam2025ASystematicEvaluationofthePlanning ] .",
        "To control API costs, especially for the larger models, we evaluated all models on the same set of 50 puzzles, consistent with prior work [ shojaee2025illusion ] .",
        "We study three prompting regimes under a common setup: Zero-Shot (no examples or reasoning cues), CoT (three worked examples encouraging stepwise reasoning), and AoT (three examples implementing a simple Manhattan-style search).",
        "The CoT and AoT prompts use the same three example boards, differing only in the reasoning styles they demonstrate.",
        "These three approaches serve as our base conditions , on which we build all subsequent attempts with and without feedback.",

        "The full prompt is available in Appendix A.2 .",
        "Algorithm-of-Thought works by guiding a language model to follow explicit algorithmic reasoning steps\u2014often structured like pseudocode or formal rules\u2014so that its outputs mimic systematic, step-by-step problem solving rather than free-form reasoning [ sel2024aot ] .",
        "The original work reports improvements across many tasks and shows that AoT can outperform other prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [ wei2022cot ] and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [ yao2023treeofthoughts , sel2024aot ] .",
        "For our work, we specify a simple Manhattan-style search\u2014similar to A*\u2014and again provide the same three example boards to stay consistent with the CoT prompt and ensure a fair comparison between approaches.",
        "For further details on the AoT prompt, see Appendix A.3 .",
        "For each puzzle that a model failed to solve on its first attempt under any condition (Zero-Shot, CoT, or AoT), we ran three independent feedback trials: a repeat control, a trial with specific feedback, and one with suggestive feedback, as shown in Fig.",
        "All three feedback trials start from the same failure state and have up to three additional attempts to solve the puzzle.",
        "That is, within a given trial, the attempt k + 1 k{+}1 resumes from the furthest valid state reached in the attempt k k .",
        "Concretely, if model M M failed puzzle i i under AoT (even if it passed under Zero-Shot or CoT), we re-prompted M M with the AoT system prompt for up to three attempts under each feedback condition: repeat (no feedback), specific feedback, and suggestive feedback.",
        "By furthest valid state we mean the last board configuration before failure: for invalid_move , where the model moves a tile off the board or one that is not adjacent to the space, or loop_detected , where the model repeats a board configuration, we resume from the state immediately before the offending move.",
        "If the model fails due to an early_stop , where it makes only valid moves but stops before reaching the goal state, we resume from the state after the last move.",
        "We reset the visited-state set at the start of each attempt.",
        "Attempts stop early upon success; otherwise, they terminate due to a timeout, token limit, early stop, loop, invalid move, or graceful failure, in which the model either refuses to solve the problem or asks for clarification on how to do so.",
        "We cap retries at three per feedback condition (repeat, specific, and suggestive) to align with prior work on iterative LLM correction [ madaan2023selfrefine ] and to limit API costs.",
        "Across feedback conditions, we keep the system prompt and hyperparameters fixed.",
        "As a control condition, we re-prompt the model from the furthest valid state of its last failed attempt without providing any feedback.",
        "The prompt presents this state as a new, standalone puzzle.",
        "This trial serves as a baseline to measure performance gains arising purely from model stochasticity and from an additional attempt, thereby isolating the effects of the feedback provided under other conditions.",
        "Specific feedback also resumes from the furthest valid state, but provides precise details on the previous failed attempt.",
        "If the model makes an invalid move, we inform it of the error and identify the specific tile involved.",
        "If it exceeds the time limit, we specify the exact duration allowed.",
        "We designed this level to help the model avoid immediately repeating the same mistake and to highlight where it went wrong so it can correct its behaviour.",
        "For example, highlighting that the model made an invalid move should encourage it to focus more on tracking the state space.",
        "Suggestive feedback includes all elements of Specific feedback, plus a scalar hint: the optimal solution length for the current board.",
        "We computed this value exactly using Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) with the admissible Manhattan-distance heuristic.",
        "Because the Manhattan heuristic is admissible (and consistent) for the 8-puzzle, the returned length equals the true optimum.",
        "We reveal only the length x x \u2014never the action sequence\u2014and append: \u201cHint: The optimal solution has x x moves.",
        "Your solution may be longer, but try to find an efficient path.\u201d The hint provides a progress signal while still leaving planning to the model, aiming to prevent it from undertaking an unnecessarily long search.",
        "We illustrate this level of feedback in Fig.",
        "In our final intervention, we offload part of the state-tracking burden from the model.",
        "The model receives the current puzzle state along with two lists: one containing all valid moves from the current position and another containing the previous move to help it avoid loops (e.g., immediately reversing the last action).",
        "This setup removes the need for the model to determine which moves are valid; it only has to examine the puzzle and select the best next move from the list.",
        "We instruct the model to return a single move, which we then apply to the puzzle.",
        "After applying the move, we update the puzzle state and move lists and re-query the model.",
        "Since the longest optimal solution for any 8-puzzle instance is 31 moves and roughly 94% of puzzles require 26 or fewer moves, we allow the models to take up to 50 moves per puzzle, providing ample opportunity to solve it while avoiding excessively long, run-on trajectories.",
        "Initial experiments established a performance baseline across all four models using Zero-Shot, CoT, and AoT prompting.",
        "The results, summarized in Fig.",
        "4 , reveal that successful puzzle completion was rare for most models.",
        "GPT-5-Thinking was the only model to achieve a modest success rate, with 30% of puzzles solved under the AoT condition.",
        "This result represents the highest performance recorded in this phase, outperforming the next-best attempt (its own CoT performance) by eight percentage points.",
        "In contrast to GPT-5-Thinking, the other models struggled significantly.",
        "Gemini-2.5-Pro and Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct were almost entirely unsuccessful, with Gemini solving only a single puzzle under the Zero-Shot condition and Llama solving none.",
        "The primary failure mode of these models is invalid moves across all prompting strategies, except Llama with CoT, which had a spike in parse errors because there was no list to extract from its answers.",
        "Interestingly, GPT-5-mini outperformed Gemini-2.5-Pro by solving more puzzles overall and at least one puzzle under each condition.",
        "GPT-5-mini also demonstrated a notable divergence from GPT-5-Thinking; its Zero-Shot performance was comparable to GPT-5-Thinking\u2019s at an 8% success rate.",
        "However, unlike its more capable counterpart, introducing more complex CoT and AoT prompts did not improve performance, as its success rate dropped under both approaches.",
        "With GPT-5-mini, we also see, in both CoT and AoT, a sharp increase in graceful failure, where the model refuses to continue or requests clarification.",
        "Reviewing success rates by difficulty, as shown in Fig.",
        "3 , we observe that success does not decrease monotonically with optimal solution length.",
        "Although all models struggle with the longest puzzles, some achieve or match their best performance in the moderate-length bins.",
        "For example, GPT-5-Thinking with AoT matches its lower bin performance in two of the moderate bins.",
        "Similarly, GPT-5-mini, with its CoT prompt, solves no puzzles in the two shortest bins, then jumps up to 10% in the middle one.",
        "This pattern points to planning and state-tracking issues, rather than puzzle difficulty alone, as the main determinants of success rates.",
        "As shown in Fig.",
        "5 , providing feedback, additional attempts, and saving progress yielded performance gains across all models and prompting strategies, except for Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct.",
        "GPT-5-Thinking showed the most significant improvement, with AoT prompting and suggestive feedback yielding a 68% success rate, the best performance for any model.",
        "As the level of feedback increased, GPT-5-Thinking\u2019s performance improved with AoT and Zero-Shot, but the opposite occurred with CoT: its performance steadily decreased.",
        "We observe the same trend for GPT-5-mini under CoT.",
        "These results suggest that more informative feedback may not always be desirable for these models.",
        "The other models, excluding Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct, also showed steady gains.",
        "Both Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-mini achieved a peak success rate of 18%.",
        "Notably, both models achieved this peak under the \"Repeat\" condition (Gemini-2.5-Pro with Zero-Shot and GPT-5-mini with CoT), suggesting that the primary benefit came from saving progress and re-prompting rather than from the feedback content itself.",
        "Gemini-2.5-Pro, however, matched this 18% performance when using the combination of AoT prompting and suggestive feedback.",
        "GPT-5-mini with CoT, similar to GPT-5-Thinking with CoT, shows a steady decline in performance as the level of feedback increases, again highlighting that more informative feedback is not always beneficial.",
        "Finally, at the lowest end of the performance spectrum, Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct failed to solve any puzzles even with feedback, underscoring a significant capability gap on this task.",
        "In the final experiment, we aimed to isolate planning abilities by offloading part of the state tracking responsibilities.",
        "The results, shown in Fig.",
        "6 , reveal a critical failure in heuristic planning: none of the models solved any puzzles.",
        "The dominant failure mode for the models shifts to looping, in which they repeat a move and return to an already visited board configuration.",
        "GPT-5-Thinking looped in 100% of trials, with Gemini-2.5-Pro and Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct looping 92% and 86% of the time, respectively.",
        "These results suggest that even when presented only with valid moves and the previous move to help track progress, these models struggle to formulate a goal-oriented path.",
        "GPT-5-mini showed a different kind of limitation: it did not solve any puzzles, but its primary outcome was early termination (68%), meaning it consistently made valid moves until it reached the 50-move limit.",
        "Therefore, GPT-5-mini exhibits a different kind of planning deficit: it can make valid moves and track the state space\u2014contrasting with its earlier single-prompt results in Fig.",
        "4 \u2014but lacks a coherent long-term strategy, effectively wandering the state space without direction.",
        "Our experiments reveal that a diverse range of LLMs, differing in producer and size, continue to struggle with simple planning and search-based tasks such as the 8-puzzle, even SOTA models like GPT-5-Thinking, which has been described as possessing PhD-level intelligence [ openai_introducing_gpt5_2025 ] .",
        "Models consistently fail due to two primary deficits: brittle internal state representations that lead to invalid moves and weak heuristic planning that results in loops.",
        "These deficits indicate that models often fail to maintain accurate board state representations or to devise effective long-term strategies.",
        "This finding underscores a key limitation: while LLMs increasingly excel on academic benchmarks, they remain challenged by sequential tasks that demand sustained planning and state awareness.",
        "The prevalence of loop failures is especially revealing because the system prompt explicitly instructs models to avoid repeating moves.",
        "Despite this explicit constraint, all models frequently violated the instruction, suggesting a fundamental difficulty in adhering to constraints.",
        "This deficit is most apparent in the external move validator experiment: even when given a list of valid moves, an explicit instruction not to repeat moves, and their previous move, the models continued to loop.",
        "One might argue that the model\u2019s internal heuristic changes between calls, but even then, it could simply select a different valid move when its preferred choice violates the constraints.",
        "Instead, it repeats moves, indicating that the planning process relies not only on weak heuristics but also fails to integrate the prompt\u2019s explicit rules.",
        "Our experiments suggest that the utility of advanced prompting strategies is model-dependent, as illustrated in Fig.",
        "While Algorithm-of-Thought (AoT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) improved performance for GPT-5-Thinking, they degraded performance for GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Pro.",
        "These findings demonstrate that, for this task, the efficacy of a prompting technique is contingent on the model, with no single approach proving universally superior.",
        "The effects of prompting extended beyond success rates, causing significant shifts in termination modes (Fig.",
        "For instance, Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct under the CoT condition exhibited an increase in parse errors, indicating a failure to adhere to the specified output format.",
        "Concurrently, GPT-5-mini showed a dramatic increase in graceful failure with both CoT and AoT, in which the model refuses to provide a solution or requests clarification.",
        "These outcomes suggest that, for some models, introducing complex prompts creates confusion, hindering their ability to follow instructions rather than aiding their reasoning.",
        "GPT-5-Thinking saw the most significant performance increase with the addition of feedback and saved progress between calls.",
        "Its success rate increased from 30% to 68%, but this comes at a substantial cost.",
        "As Table 1 shows, the model needs, on average, two attempts, 24 minutes, over twice as many moves and 75,000 tokens to solve a puzzle.",
        "These averages are all higher when we include the puzzles that the models failed to solve.",
        "Furthermore, we obtain these results under carefully engineered prompts designed to be as helpful as possible for this task.",
        "Thus, while performance may increase, the compute and human resources required to provide these gains are substantial and problem-dependent.",
        "Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-mini both have similar issues with resource usage.",
        "While their average time, tokens and moves needed are lower overall, they require more attempts and have a substantially lower success rate of 18%.",
        "In our final experiment with the external move validator, no model solved a single puzzle.",
        "As shown in Fig.",
        "6 , this intervention hurt performance, lowering the success rates of all models and shifting the dominant failure mode to looping in most models and early termination in GPT-5-mini.",
        "Fig.",
        "7 further illustrates the planning deficit, showing that the models made minimal progress toward the goal state despite making numerous valid moves.",
        "For instance, GPT-5-mini made, on average, nearly forty-seven valid moves to achieve only about six moves of progress based on a Manhattan-distance heuristic.",
        "GPT-5-Thinking and Gemini were more efficient in that they made better progress in fewer moves, but this matters little, as they often began to repeat moves, completely stagnating progress.",
        "This finding highlights that, even when given only valid moves, models either rely on heuristics so weak that solving a typical puzzle could require well over 100 moves, or they begin repeating moves and cycling through already visited states.",
        "Our findings, though derived from a single domain, carry significant implications for LLM deployment.",
        "We observe that all models struggle with this simple task, and while engineered prompts with feedback and saved-state progression show improvement, they are costly.",
        "These interventions also fail to make any model reliable, as none achieves a success rate over 70%.",
        "The nature of these failures is also concerning, with the primary deficits not just weak heuristic planning that leads to loops, but also a persistent difficulty in maintaining an accurate representation of the board state, leading to \"hallucinated\" or invalid moves.",
        "These errors lead to a critical issue: models frequently output solutions as if they have correctly solved the puzzle, without detecting the mistakes made earlier in the sequence.",
        "This kind of false confidence undermines trust, because a model\u2019s final output may rest on undetected errors earlier in the sequence.",
        "These findings challenge the vision of deploying LLMs as autonomous agents in complex, real-world applications.",
        "If an LLM cannot reliably track its own state in a simple, deterministic puzzle, it may have similar issues in high-stakes, dynamic environments.",
        "In domains such as autonomous robotics, financial trading, or logistics management, an agent that proceeds with high confidence after an internal error can be unreliable and potentially dangerous.",
        "It risks costly or harmful outcomes by acting on a flawed premise.",
        "One might ask why we do not simply allow the models to use code interpreters for this task\u2014after all, using tools is itself a form of reasoning.",
        "However, allowing the model to write and execute code changes the nature of the problem: the evaluation then focuses on whether the model can produce valid code, a capability already well studied by existing benchmarks.",
        "Moreover, code-based search largely masks planning and state tracking, since an external algorithm can solve the puzzle without the model needing to devise or maintain a long-term strategy.",
        "Therefore, in our experiments, we exclude code interpreters because they would mask the abilities we seek to examine.",
        "In this work, we examined a range of LLMs using the 8-puzzle to probe their planning and stateful reasoning capabilities.",
        "Our findings show that both SOTA and small models still struggle significantly with this seemingly simple task, with failures indicating critical deficits in state tracking and heuristic planning.",
        "While feedback and prompt engineering offer some help, they are costly and do not provide the gains needed to make these models reliable.",
        "Furthermore, even when offloading some of the burden by providing the model with valid moves and its last move, no model solves any puzzles.",
        "The tendency for models to be unaware of their mistakes and to proceed with high confidence after undetected errors poses a substantial risk in real-world settings.",
        "These poor success rates underscore a fundamental gap between current LLM capabilities and the reliable, stateful reasoning required for genuine autonomy.",
        "Our work has several limitations.",
        "First, we examine only a single domain.",
        "While the 8-puzzle is informative for tracking a model\u2019s progress and may be representative of more challenging sequential planning tasks, it remains a single task, which limits our ability to draw broad conclusions about model performance in other settings.",
        "Second, we evaluate the models on only 50 puzzles, which is a relatively small dataset.",
        "Finally, although we generated puzzles at random to reduce the risk of training-data contamination, we cannot entirely rule it out.",
        "As outlined in our Methods section, we designed the Zero-Shot prompt to provide an overview of the problem and the rules the model must follow.",
        "We provide no additional assistance to the model.",
        "This format serves as our control condition, showing how strong each model is on its own, without prompting-based guidance.",
        "We designed the few-shot CoT prompt to show the model several worked examples of how to solve different puzzles.",
        "The solutions vary in length but are kept relatively short to keep the prompt manageable.",
        "In each example, we explicitly track the state by repeating the current board after each move.",
        "This explicit state tracking is intended to encourage the model to follow a similar procedure and to minimize the number of invalid moves.",
        "The few-shot AoT prompt is our longest system prompt.",
        "It contains the same three examples used in the CoT prompt, but the search-based procedure we demonstrate makes the prompt much longer in practice.",
        "It provides an explicit heuristic for the model to follow, and, as in the CoT prompt, we also illustrate state tracking step by step in each example.",
        "The external move validator prompt is similar to the Zero-Shot prompt; however, we now provide a list of valid moves from the current state and the previous move to prevent the model from immediately repeating a move.",
        "Aside from the variation in state, valid moves, and the previous move, we pass the same prompt to the model on each call.",
        "With specific feedback we tell the model exactly why it failed.",
        "We provide specific limits on time and tokens.",
        "We also tell it the exact move it made that caused it to fail in the case of invalid moves, early stops and loops.",
        "Suggestive feedback uses the same prompts as specific feedback; the only modification is that we append a hint to the end of the feedback.",
        "This hint specifies the length of the optimal solution from current state."

Successive models exhibit increasingly sophisticated capabilities [ openai_gpt5_syscard_web_2025 , gemini2025 ] , yet their evaluation still centers largely on mathematics and code generation benchmarks [ Hendrycks2020MMLU , balunovic2025matharena , Jimenez2023SWEBench ] . Many studies have investigated how to improve LLM reasoning without fine-tuning models [ wei2022cot , wang2023selfconsistency , yao2023treeofthoughts , sel2024aot ] . A common approach that consistently shows improvement is prompt engineering, where one uses the system prompt to specify how the model should approach a problem. The 8-puzzle is a simple and widely used search problem in AI [ russell2020aima , complete8puzzle ] . The puzzle consists of a 3-by-3 grid with eight numbered, sliding tiles (1\u20138) and a single blank space (represented as 0). Initial experiments established a performance baseline across all four models using Zero-Shot, CoT, and AoT prompting. The results, summarized in Fig. Our experiments reveal that a diverse range of LLMs, differing in producer and size, continue to struggle with simple planning and search-based tasks such as the 8-puzzle, even SOTA models like GPT-5-Thinking, which has been described as possessing PhD-level intelligence [ openai_introducing_gpt5_2025 ] . Models consistently fail due to two primary deficits: brittle internal state representations that lead to invalid moves and weak heuristic planning that results in loops. In this work, we examined a range of LLMs using the 8-puzzle to probe their planning and stateful reasoning capabilities. Our findings show that both SOTA and small models still struggle significantly with this seemingly simple task, with failures indicating critical deficits in state tracking and heuristic planning. Our work has several limitations. First, we examine only a single domain. As outlined in our Methods section, we designed the Zero-Shot prompt to provide an overview of the problem and the rules the model must follow. We provide no additional assistance to the model. With specific feedback we tell the model exactly why it failed. We provide specific limits on time and tokens. "

        "paragraphs": "Policymaking is inherently forward-looking. Governments must craft strategies that anticipate and mitigate future risks while seizing emerging opportunities. However, this process is not simply about labeling futures as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d Rather, the critical question is whether we leave enough room to shape the future [ van2019toward ] . Predictions often limit this potential by presenting a fixed future, leaving little space for hope or innovation. As adam2007future argue, \u201cthe future is open, but not empty.\u201d Predictions close off the future rather than opening it up to possibilities and new initiatives. In contrast, responsible foresight [ van2019toward ] recognizes that while certain challenges of tomorrow\u2014such as climate change or disruptive technologies\u2014may seem daunting, there is still room to shape outcomes through thoughtful, ethical action today.\nAs technological advancements\u2014particularly in artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014open new possibilities for forecasting and decision-making, speculation grows over whether AI could one day be used as supportive tools for human policymakers. This question gains urgency as AI tools, like large language models (LLMs), appear increasingly capable of performing sophisticated language-based tasks. These models can draft contracts, compose poetry, suggest travel itineraries, and even assist in generating text for government policy documents. For example, the UK\u2019s AI tool \"Redbox\" has been used to streamline ministerial workflows. Around the world, governments are exploring whether AI could support policymaking; a 2024 report [ AIingov2024 ] revealed that over a third (37%) of UK government departments actively use AI, with another 37% either piloting (25%) or planning (11%) AI initiatives.\nThis interest is largely driven by the complex, interconnected global challenges policymakers face\u2014challenges that are often difficult to address without relevant datasets, scientific insights, and scenario-analysis tools. Climate change, for instance, is an area where policymakers depend on computer simulations to predict future scenarios and shape policy, as evidenced by two decades of climate forecasting from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Such simulations involve complex calculations that surpass human cognitive abilities, similar to those used during the COVID-19 pandemic to model the virus\u2019s exponential growth and inform public health policies. These computational tools augment human understanding, helping us envision the consequences of our choices and responsibly shape the future.\nWhile simulations have historically been designed by scientists, AI is now expanding these capabilities and introducing new applications to the policy cycle [ lv2022artificial ] . AI can analyze vast amounts of social media data to capture public sentiment 1 1 1 https://radio.unglobalpulse.net/uganda/ , simulate policy instruments and their potential impacts [ rudd2024crafting ] , identify valuable research [ susnjak2024automating ] , optimize urban planning [ son2023algorithmic ] , and even evaluate policies in real-time [ wirjo2002artificial ] .\nHowever, policymaking necessitates more than simulations or accurate predictions based on past data [ van2019bias ] . While prediction\u2014e.g. using AI to foresee probable scenarios based on historical trends\u2014plays a role, it cannot address the full spectrum of policy challenges.\nPolicymakers instead must engage in responsible foresight, exploring a range of possible futures, including those that are unexpected, unintended and desirable. Responsible foresight [ uruena2021foresight ] will thus require technical tools like AI to close the decision loop, but also a deep understanding of the interconnected social, economic, and environmental systems that influence future outcomes, alongside a commitment to ethical and sustainable decision-making.\nThis paper examines the role of human-centric AI in supporting responsible foresight in policymaking. We call this field responsible computational foresight . We argue that while AI can be instrumental in helping policymakers anticipate risks and seize opportunities, it should not replace, but rather augment, the ethical, social, and creative dimensions of human judgment. AI should be viewed as a tool to enhance policymakers\u2019 and societies\u2019 capacity for thoughtful future design, empowering them to navigate uncertainty and create strategies that are effective, sustainable, and ethically sound. Our goal is to foster an informed dialogue around the opportunities and risks associated with AI in policymaking. By doing so, we aim to contribute to the development of a dynamic, evolving framework that addresses the complex socio-technical dilemmas and ethical challenges inherent in algorithmic decision-making for public governance. This approach will help policymakers navigate the intricacies of these tools, ultimately aiming to enhance public welfare while safeguarding trust and accountability.",

        "paragraphs": "In an era of rapid technological advancements, global interconnectivity, and complex societal challenges, governments must increasingly anticipate future trends and uncertainties to craft effective, sustainable policies. This is where the practice of foresight becomes essential. Foresight refers to the systematic exploration of possible futures [ martin1995foresight ] , enabling policymakers, futurists and foresighters to proactively shape strategies instead of merely reacting to emerging issues [ van2019bias ] . However, the process of foresight must also be conducted responsibly to ensure that the actions we take today align with ethical principles and sustainability goals for future generations.\nResponsible foresight can be defined as a structured and ethically-driven approach to exploring and shaping possible futures, grounded in methodological rigor that leverages high-quality data, scientifically sound analyses, and flexibility. But also, importantly, incorporating core values like sustainability, equity, and inclusivity, helping policymakers anticipate risks, assess multiple scenarios, and make proactive, accountable decisions. This approach prioritizes empowering society to navigate uncertainty, fostering the creation of resilient and ethically-informed futures.\nResponsible foresight goes beyond simply predicting or preparing for the future [ van2019toward ] ; it integrates values such as equity, environmental stewardship, and social justice into long-term thinking [ fuller2024responsible , bierwisch2024futures ] , treating the future as an open space that we can actively shape through present choices. This approach enables policymakers, strategists, and leaders to not only anticipate opportunities and challenges but also to consider a broader range of outcomes and consequences that may be nonlinear or unexpected. By exploring multiple potential futures, responsible foresight supports better policymaking, allowing for more informed, flexible, and adaptive governance.\nRather than attempting to predict one definitive future, responsible foresight encourages the exploration of diverse scenarios, helping policymakers identify actions that can shape a preferable future. It serves as a guide for present decisions and actions, emphasizing proactive steps to prevent potential problems from arising in areas such as technology, social policy, and ethics.\nA responsible approach to foresight is not about accurate predictions but about empowering society to make responsible choices today. By presenting a range of potential futures, foresight enables innovation and emphasizes the ethical implications of decisions, ensuring that policies are crafted with both immediate and long-term goals in mind. This approach also values adaptability, recognizing the need for policies to evolve in response to shifting circumstances.\nLong-term thinking through responsible foresight is essential for addressing complex global challenges like climate change, technological disruption, and socioeconomic inequality. While the future remains uncertain, responsible foresight provides a roadmap to navigate these complexities, equipping policymakers to build more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient futures.\nIn our work, we have identified several principles that are key to responsible foresight, which extend beyond general foresight practices to include fundamental aspects such as scientific rigor and data integrity. These principles are essential to ensuring that any computational tools used in responsible foresight uphold high standards and contribute to effective, reliable decision-making. Below are some of the core principles that are key to responsible foresight:\nSustainability and justice\nSustainability : Foresight should prioritize long-term environmental and societal sustainability to ensure future generations inherit a resilient and livable world.\nEquity and intergenerational justice : Responsible foresight should consider fairness not only among current populations but also between present and future generations. Policies should aim to prevent inequalities and ensure that future generations are not burdened by today\u2019s decisions, balancing current needs with long-term impacts.\nPrecautionary principle : Minimize risks and prevent harm by carefully evaluating potential dangers, particularly in the face of uncertainty and emerging technologies.\nEthics, inclusion and transparency\nEthical considerations : Evaluate the moral implications of future scenarios to ensure decisions avoid harming vulnerable populations or promoting unjust practices.\nInclusivity and participation : Actively involve diverse stakeholders in shaping visions of the future, including marginalized groups. This mitigates bias and ensures that decisions are grounded in a broad range of perspectives.\nEmpowerment and capacity-building : Enable citizens and organizations to engage proactively with foresight, fostering resilience and adaptability amid uncertainty.\nAccountability and transparency : Governments must remain accountable for the future they help shape, ensuring that foresight processes are transparent and open to public scrutiny.\nIntegrated systems and resilience\nSystems thinking : Consider the interdependence of economic, environmental, technological, and social systems to understand the ripple effects of decisions.\nAdaptability and responsiveness : Responsible foresight requires policies to be designed with the flexibility to respond to unforeseen developments. Given the dynamic nature of global challenges, policies must be adaptable to changing data, emerging trends, and unanticipated risks, allowing for iterative improvements based on new information.\nIterative and exploratory practices\nExploration of multiple futures : Rather than fixing on a singular, predicted future, responsible foresight explores multiple potential futures. This approach provides insight into how present-day actions could lead to various outcomes, empowering decision-makers with more nuanced options.\nContinuous monitoring and feedback loops : As conditions evolve, foresight practices should include regular monitoring and feedback mechanisms to assess the impact of decisions and adjust course when necessary. This principle supports accountability by ensuring that foresight is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that responds to new data and changing conditions.\nScientific rigor and data integrity\nScientific rigor : Foresight must be underpinned by scientifically sound methodologies, ensuring that predictions and scenario analyses are based on reliable, validated approaches. This involves using rigorous models, transparent assumptions, and systematic methods to produce credible and robust insights.\nData integrity : The accuracy, quality, and transparency of the data used in foresight processes are paramount. Foresight tools should prioritize high-quality, unbiased data sources, ensuring that information is accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date. Ensuring data integrity helps prevent the distortion of outcomes and maintains trust in foresight results.",

        "title": "3 Computational modelling for responsible foresight",
        "paragraphs": "While the future remains uncertain, modern civilization is structured around efforts to anticipate what lies ahead and much of that work is done through modelling approaches, whether in the short term (e.g. weather forecasts and traffic predictions) or over decades (such as climate projections and demographic trends). These forecasts help societies prepare for what may come, and as the pace and complexity of change seem to accelerate, so too has the need for effective anticipation.\nIncorporating responsible foresight into policymaking increasingly will involve the use of algorithms to analyze complex data, predict potential outcomes, and offer insight into a range of possible futures. However, algorithms must be carefully designed to align with the key principles of responsible foresight listed before, ensuring they are not only scientifically rigorous but also ethically grounded, adaptable, and inclusive. By embedding these principles into algorithmic design and deployment, policymakers can leverage computational tools to support long-term, sustainable, and equitable decision-making.\nPublic policymaking is inherently a cyclical and iterative process, encompassing stages such as the identification of societal needs, formulation of agendas and policy alternatives, adoption of policy measures, real-world implementation, and finally, evaluation of outcomes, followed by refinements and improvements [ jann2017theories ] . This cycle, as illustrated in Figure 1 , represents a structured pathway that allows for continuous learning and adaptation. Yet, in practice, policymakers are also subject to external influences beyond this structured cycle, including budget constraints, public opinion, the interests of civil society, ideological stances, media narratives, economic conditions, and ongoing scientific research\u2014all of which shape and constrain policy decisions in significant ways.\nWhen analyzing each step of the policymaking cycle, it becomes clear that algorithmic and computational tools have the potential to enhance decision-making at every phase. Numerous prototypes and small-scale proofs of concept already demonstrate how AI and algorithmic methods can support critical policymaking functions. For example, at the initial stage of identifying needs, AI applications have proven instrumental in rapidly synthesizing large datasets and detecting emerging patterns in real time, enabling more agile responses. This capability is particularly crucial in the context of today\u2019s \"infodemic\", where over 90% of online data has been generated in recent years, with approximately 80% of this data being unstructured and thus challenging to process without sophisticated tools.\nIn this sense, the Victoria State Government in Australia implemented a \u201csyndromic surveillance\u201d program, which monitors reported symptoms and patient characteristics across hospitals. Within just four months, this tool allowed policymakers to identify and address six distinct public health issues. Similarly, the United Nations Global Pulse initiative in Uganda utilized a radio content analysis tool to capture public concerns, which informed the planning and prioritization of development projects. These examples highlight AI\u2019s potential to aggregate and analyze complex data, providing actionable insights that can guide policy decisions at scale and speed previously unattainable.\nDespite this potential, the far-reaching impact of policy decisions mandates careful scrutiny of these technologies, as they bring inherent risks and ethical concerns alongside their benefits. The public\u2019s trust in government is closely tied to transparency, fairness, and accountability in decision-making. Accordingly, any deployment of AI in policymaking must be underpinned by robust frameworks that ensure these technologies are used responsibly. Principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability must be integral from the outset, ensuring that AI-driven decisions are scientifically valid and ethically sound. Before policymakers commit to these technological tools, it is essential to establish a foundation that prioritizes these principles.\nOur efforts to glimpse the future fall into two primary approaches: prediction and foresight. Prediction is grounded in understanding a system\u2019s components and how they interact, allowing us to estimate how the system\u2019s state might evolve in response to various changes. With certain systems, we can make reasonable predictions that yield one likely outcome. However, in most cases, futures research recognizes that the future cannot be predicted with complete accuracy. Instead, it\u2019s a matter of probabilistic thinking. Often, a range of distinct outcomes is possible, requiring us to rely on foresight [ mcmaster1996foresight ] . Foresight combines methods for gathering and assessing information relevant to multiple potential outcomes, evaluating their implications, and discussing which scenarios may be most desirable. For issues like climate change, geopolitical shifts, or evolving lifestyle patterns, foresight emphasizes exploring the full range of possible and sometimes unexpected futures, not merely those that seem probable. This process may be organized from the top down (as in strategic foresight [ brandtner2021artificial ] ) or through participatory approaches [ van2019bias ] , involving diverse voices and perspectives.\nWe review now a series of tools aimed at responsible foresight (some of the tools taking inspiration from the ones listed in [ GESDA2024 ] ), and discuss the role of computational modeling in each of those, presenting recent and novel examples from the literature.\nWhile anticipating the future is challenging, it is possible to achieve valuable insights, as demonstrated by approaches like superforecasting and prediction markets. These methods synthesize various data sources to produce meaningful forecasts. Superforecasting [ tetlock2016superforecasting ] , a skill typically honed by individuals (but extendable also to computational methods/agents) known for their consistent accuracy in making probabilistic predictions, demonstrates that certain methods and cognitive strategies can enhance the ability to forecast uncertain events (e.g. disciplined reasoning, openness to updating beliefs, and careful consideration of probabilities). Prediction markets [ wolfers2004prediction ] , on the other hand, harness the collective intelligence of groups, allowing individuals to buy and sell shares in future outcomes. These markets aggregate diverse perspectives, synthesizing information in a way that often produces highly accurate forecasts. Both superforecasting and prediction markets represent powerful tools for approaching future uncertainties, particularly in complex environments where multiple factors intersect.\nForecasting specifically has seen significant advances through AI, which has excelled for over a decade in well-defined tasks like weather prediction. Recently, however, new advanced generative models geared toward superforecasting complex, world-changing events\u2014across domains like society, economy, politics, and science\u2014are emerging as new tools [ zou2022forecasting , karger2024forecastbench , pratt2024can ] . Specifically, large language models (LLMs) trained on past human forecasts are beginning to achieve performance levels that approach, though do not yet surpass, human forecasters. In fact, \u201ccrowds\u201d of LLMs have sometimes reached the accuracy of human superforecasters [ schoenegger2024wisdom ] .\nA seemingly promising development is the use of LLMs as forecasting assistants: recent studies show that human superforecasting accuracy improves by 23% when LLMs are used as supportive tools, without diminishing forecast diversity [ schoenegger2024ai ] . These models are also beneficial in refining prediction market data by aggregating and weighing various predictions to produce more accurate forecasts [ gruen2023machine ] . However, some studies suggest more conservative expectations [ abolghasemi2024humans ] , highlighting the need for caution when deploying these as assistants. Ultimately, advanced models such as LLMs are starting to show potential in enhancing human forecasting capabilities and as a tool for refining collective predictions in complex domains.\nThere is however a critical risk that the use of superforecasting may inadvertently act as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Predictions generated or amplified by this tool of foresight could influence decision-makers, markets, or public sentiment, thereby increasing the likelihood of the forecasted outcomes occurring simply because they were predicted. This underscores the importance of the rest of the tools presented in this section, which aim to empower humans to imagine and design the future, using predictions not as fixed outcomes but as guides to inform the actions needed to shape more desirable and equitable possibilities.\nBeyond probabilistic forecasting tools, some researchers and practitioners have been working toward a more holistic form of anticipation through world simulation\u2014advanced modeling frameworks that strive to capture the vast, interconnected nature of global systems. These simulations aim to model key physical, economic, social, and ecological processes, offering a dynamic platform where different scenarios can be tested to observe potential outcomes. These tools are essential in addressing the major challenges humanity faces in the 21st century. World simulation allows for the exploration of various \"what if\" scenarios and provides policymakers and stakeholders with a visualized, interactive way to grasp the consequences of specific decisions. For instance, simulations can illuminate the long-term impact of climate policy, the ripple effects of geopolitical shifts, or how different energy policies might influence socioeconomic conditions across regions. By constructing a high-fidelity representation of interconnected systems, world simulation helps translate complex data into a form that supports responsible foresight.\nWorld simulation is not a new concept; it traces back to the Limits to Growth report in 1972, which used early computer models to examine the potential consequences of exponential economic and population growth within a finite resource environment. Today, the concept has evolved through the advent of digital twins [ lv2022artificial ] \u2014digital replicas of physical objects, systems, or processes contextualized within their digital environments. Digital twins enable organizations to simulate real-world situations and potential outcomes, helping them make better-informed decisions. For example, integrated assessment models [ parson1997integrated ] are a form of digital twin used by scientists and policymakers to support decision-making by modeling the intricate interactions among society, the environment, and the economy.\nRecently, machine learning has further enhanced these models\u2019 predictive capabilities by capturing underlying dynamics with greater precision. For example, AI shows promise in emulating complex biological systems [ stolfi2021emulating ] , while hybrid models that combine machine learning with physics-based simulations have begun to yield significant predictive improvements [ willard2020integrating ] . Although many challenges remain in creating digital twins that can fully replicate real-world systems, promising early results in AI-based world simulation are beginning to emerge [ yang2023learning ] , even as accurate proxies of certain human behaviours [ park2023generative ] .\nSimulation intelligence is an emerging field that combines advanced simulations and AI to analyze and understand complex systems [ lavin2021simulation ] . By integrating AI with high-fidelity simulations (e.g. as the previous subsection describes), simulation intelligence enables the exploration of a complex system, \"what-if\" scenarios within it and the discovery of optimal control policies. This approach could empower organizations and policymakers to comprehend and manage complex systems, by employing computational tools to explore potential system interventions. This can be used as a tool for discovery, enabling a \"closed generative loop\" that can generate new insights for applications like drug discovery or crafting effective policies in urban planning [ son2023algorithmic ] and climate [ rudd2024crafting ] .\nSee for example [ stock2024plant ] , which explores the transformative potential for the plant science community of the simulation intelligence motifs, from understanding molecular plant processes to optimizing greenhouse control, arguing that these can potentially revolutionize breeding and precision farming towards more sustainable food production. Similarly, simulation intelligence can be used for generating new policy insights that balance sustainability trade-offs [ rudd2024crafting ] .\nSimulation intelligence involves a diverse set of techniques, including simulation-based inference, causal modeling, agent-based modeling, and probabilistic methods, among others. Coordinating these approaches offers significant potential to advance scientific discovery and inform policymaking. This could range from solving inverse problems in fields like synthetic biology and climate science to guiding nuclear energy experiments and predicting complex behavior in socioeconomic systems [ lavin2021simulation ] . The scope of simulation intelligence is extensive, especially as emerging research integrates different data modalities for enhanced outcomes\u2014for example, combining natural language processing with simulation intelligence by using large language models (LLMs) alongside simulation and optimization techniques to tackle complex challenges [ rasal2024optimal ] .\nScenario-building and foresight techniques, which use narrative and visual tools to aid in anticipation, are crucial, supporting this anticipatory process by presenting a structured way to explore multiple potential futures [ drew2006building ] . Scenario-building involves creating plausible, narrative-driven models of the future, each based on a different set of assumptions and drivers. By examining how factors such as technological advances, social trends, or regulatory shifts might unfold, scenarios help humans identify a range of possible futures rather than one fixed outcome. This approach enables decision-makers to consider the broader implications of their choices, evaluate diverse pathways, and recognize which scenarios align with their values and goals. When integrated with robust foresight methods, scenarios can illuminate both risks and opportunities, empowering leaders to make more informed and adaptable decisions.\nAdvanced AI systems, such as LLMs, are now employed in scenario generation to explore unlikely or edge cases that could advance Industry 5.0 [ chang2024llmscenario ] . Beyond industry, these models could also be used to examine unexpected outcomes resulting from policy interventions. LLMs additionally contribute by generating narratives\u2014vivid glimpses into potential futures that help us envision life within them [ zhao2023more ] . AI-assisted scenario building has shown promise in creating a diverse range of scenarios, offering valuable insights that can support progress toward sustainable development [ carlsenai ] .\nApart from scenario-building, participatory futures and futures literacy initiatives further help communities and organizations to think critically about the future, focusing on making it a more inclusive and engaged process. This adds another crucial dimension to responsible foresight by actively involving communities and stakeholders in the foresight process. Participatory futures [ gidley2009participatory ] seek to democratize future-planning by engaging people from diverse backgrounds, including those often underrepresented in policy discussions, to share their insights, hopes, and concerns for the future. This approach recognizes that incorporating a wide array of perspectives can mitigate bias and help ensure that proposed strategies are socially inclusive, innovative and resilient. Futures literacy, meanwhile, involves developing the skills, datasets and frameworks that allow individuals and new technologies to support thinking critically and creatively about the future. It equips people and machines to understand the purpose and limitations of foresight exercises, enhancing their capacity to interpret, question, and act on future-oriented insights. Together, participatory futures and futures literacy contribute to responsible foresight by fostering a collective sense of ownership over the future, empowering communities to envision and shape futures that reflect their values. By doing so, AI can contribute to education for democracy, fostering the design of participatory futures, where diverse voices shape tomorrow\u2019s decisions. This approach empowers individuals and communities to actively engage in envisioning and co-creating equitable and inclusive futures, ensuring that the democratic process extends into shaping the world of tomorrow.\nEnvisioning future scenarios based on events and (in)actions is essential for democratic engagement, yet it is often the domain of experts with deep insights into social, political, environmental, or technological trends. AI co-writing tools [ tost2024futuring ] have shown promise in reducing barriers to participation, empowering non-experts to imagine future scenarios and craft fictional stories set in speculative futures. LLMs extend scenario-based design by generating \"value scenarios\" [ jung2023toward ] , which foster critical, systemic, and long-term thinking in design practices, technology development, and deployment. Some of these models are also applied in participatory planning, such as generating urban plans that integrate the diverse needs of residents [ zhou2024large ] . AI holds the potential to enhance democratic and participatory processes by facilitating more accessible methods of preference elicitation and simulating collective preferences [ gudino2024large , feffer2023preference ] . By simplifying how preferences are gathered, AI can broaden public participation, making it easier for individuals to express their views. Additionally, AI can augment existing citizens assemblies [ mckinney2024integrating ] or data on political preferences [ feffer2023preference ] , providing deeper insights into public opinion and supporting more responsive, inclusive decision-making. Although few works exist at the intersection of futures literacy and AI, emerging studies illustrate how futures literacy can help envision the future of a world with AI and its broader impacts [ liveley2022ai , leander2020critical ] .\nWhile not very developed as a field yet, the topic of hybrid human-artificial intelligence [ schlobach2022hhai2022 ] will play a pivotal role in advancing responsible foresight by combining the complementary strengths of both human and machine intelligence.\nIt is important to note that AI represents a fundamentally different kind of intelligence than that of humans, one that processes data rapidly and accurately, operates without fatigue or distraction, and performs complex computations that can optimize systems with efficiency. While these capabilities offer clear advantages to our human mind, AI\u2019s limitations\u2014such as the current absence of common sense and reasoning\u2014raise concerns about its reliability in nuanced decision-making. Without a nuanced understanding of context and reliable data (e.g. often unavailable for black swan events), AI can unintentionally perpetuate biases or preconceptions present in its training data, creating unintended consequences if left unchecked. This is further compounded by AI\u2019s need for vast amounts of data and high energy demands, highlighting an important challenge for responsible foresight: developing ethical, sustainable, and context-sensitive AI systems that fully support human intelligence in future decision-making.\nHuman intelligence, by contrast, is adaptive and integrative. Humans generalize quickly from few examples, adapting to novel contexts and switching fluidly between immediate needs and long-term goals. Our capacities for imagination, empathy, and ethical judgment make us particularly well-suited for responsible foresight. When envisioning future scenarios, humans consider not just logical outcomes but also social, emotional, and ethical dimensions. This integrative perspective remains essential in tackling complex, open-ended challenges like climate change or global inequality, which require foresight to consider both anticipated and unforeseen impacts on society.\nEffective human-computer interaction (HCI) is key to this collaboration between humans and machines, ensuring that AI systems are designed to be intuitive, transparent, and responsive to human needs. Interactive interfaces, explainable AI models, and participatory design processes can facilitate a seamless exchange of insights between humans and machines, enabling users to critically engage with AI outputs and refine them based on their expertise and ethical considerations. Importantly, this interaction must address the balance between foretell and forsay: humans should retain the ability to question, contradict, or reshape the foresights provided by AI, preventing these outputs from being treated as unchallengeable truths or prophetic decrees. By embedding mechanisms for contestation and oversight, such as tools for scrutinizing input data, questioning assumptions, and modeling alternative scenarios, humans can maintain control and avoid the risk of \"Garbage In, Gospel Out\". This ensures that foresight remains a deliberative process, grounded in human judgment and ethical reflection, rather than a deterministic one dictated by machines. By fostering interactive partnerships, hybrid intelligence enables the co-creation of futures that are not only informed by data but also guided by shared values, ethical considerations, and diverse perspectives.\nThese complementary methods\u2014Superforecasting, prediction markets, world simulation, simulation intelligence, scenario-building, participatory futures, futures literacy and hybrid intelligence\u2014form a powerful toolkit for responsible computational foresight. Each approach contributes unique insights: Superforecasting harnesses the wisdom of skilled forecasters to generate highly accurate predictions; prediction markets leverage collective knowledge; world simulation creates virtual environments to capture the complexity of our social, economic and environmental systems; and simulation intelligence uses AI to design control strategies within simulation worlds providing meaningful insights on efficient and resilient pathways for the future. Scenario-building further supports human imagination in identifying a range of possible futures. Participatory futures invite diverse stakeholders into the process, democratizing foresight by integrating varied perspectives, while futures literacy builds a capacity for flexible, long-term thinking. Hybrid intelligence and human-computer interaction add another vital layer, bridging the computational and human dimensions of foresight by enabling collaboration, contestation, and creativity. Together, they ensure that these methods not only generate robust insights but also remain aligned with human values, ethics, and agency. Various tools already embody the principles of responsible computational foresight, such as those designed for AI-assisted deliberation [ zhang2023deliberating , lyu2023design ] or for developing action plans in disaster scenarios [ goecks2023disasterresponsegpt ] .\nWhen applied thoughtfully, these tools strengthen our ability to explore a spectrum of possible futures, reinforcing ethical decision-making and enhancing resilience in the face of uncertainty. Rather than aiming for precise predictions, this toolkit enables us to anticipate and prepare for a range of outcomes, helping society to navigate complexity with informed, adaptive, and inclusive strategies. By doing so, responsible computational foresight not only supports current decision-making but also empowers us to shape sustainable and equitable paths forward for generations to come.\nFigure 2 illustrates the process outlined in this position paper, showing how policymakers are empowered by a range of computational tools that support responsible foresight. These tools enable forecasting, complex systems simulation, creative scenario-building, and the integration of diverse perspectives, enhancing the policymaking process by providing a more comprehensive understanding of future possibilities. By using these methods, policymakers can better diagnose challenges, identify root causes, and establish an intentional, forward-looking agenda. This approach aids in selecting policies that effectively support targeted change and helps to determine optimal courses of action, all while incorporating real-time insights through augmented democratic participation [ gudino2024large ] .\nIn addition to these core methods, other related fields, such as computational diplomacy [ cederman2023computational ] , play an essential role in planning agendas and policies towards more desirable futures. Here, tools like game theory assist policymakers in crafting effective strategies within the complex landscape of global, multicultural interests. This holistic, computationally augmented approach to foresight positions policymakers to address both current and future challenges in a more inclusive, adaptive, and resilient way.\nResponsible computational foresight is about supporting humans in understanding and designing the future.\nThis is in line with the tenets of the field of future design, citing [ miller2011opinion ] : \u201cWe should abandon the effort to try to be so clever that we can choose the right model, find the right data, or make the best guess. There is no way to outsmart the complexity of reality; unforeseeable novelty is a certainty. Instead, the approach should be to try and develop the capacity to use the future in a range of different ways, and not be limited by prediction or by narrow conceptions of a desired future. It is about being Futures Literate.\u201d.",

            "paragraphs": "Public policymaking is inherently a cyclical and iterative process, encompassing stages such as the identification of societal needs, formulation of agendas and policy alternatives, adoption of policy measures, real-world implementation, and finally, evaluation of outcomes, followed by refinements and improvements [ jann2017theories ] . This cycle, as illustrated in Figure 1 , represents a structured pathway that allows for continuous learning and adaptation. Yet, in practice, policymakers are also subject to external influences beyond this structured cycle, including budget constraints, public opinion, the interests of civil society, ideological stances, media narratives, economic conditions, and ongoing scientific research\u2014all of which shape and constrain policy decisions in significant ways.\nWhen analyzing each step of the policymaking cycle, it becomes clear that algorithmic and computational tools have the potential to enhance decision-making at every phase. Numerous prototypes and small-scale proofs of concept already demonstrate how AI and algorithmic methods can support critical policymaking functions. For example, at the initial stage of identifying needs, AI applications have proven instrumental in rapidly synthesizing large datasets and detecting emerging patterns in real time, enabling more agile responses. This capability is particularly crucial in the context of today\u2019s \"infodemic\", where over 90% of online data has been generated in recent years, with approximately 80% of this data being unstructured and thus challenging to process without sophisticated tools.\nIn this sense, the Victoria State Government in Australia implemented a \u201csyndromic surveillance\u201d program, which monitors reported symptoms and patient characteristics across hospitals. Within just four months, this tool allowed policymakers to identify and address six distinct public health issues. Similarly, the United Nations Global Pulse initiative in Uganda utilized a radio content analysis tool to capture public concerns, which informed the planning and prioritization of development projects. These examples highlight AI\u2019s potential to aggregate and analyze complex data, providing actionable insights that can guide policy decisions at scale and speed previously unattainable.\nDespite this potential, the far-reaching impact of policy decisions mandates careful scrutiny of these technologies, as they bring inherent risks and ethical concerns alongside their benefits. The public\u2019s trust in government is closely tied to transparency, fairness, and accountability in decision-making. Accordingly, any deployment of AI in policymaking must be underpinned by robust frameworks that ensure these technologies are used responsibly. Principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability must be integral from the outset, ensuring that AI-driven decisions are scientifically valid and ethically sound. Before policymakers commit to these technological tools, it is essential to establish a foundation that prioritizes these principles.",

            "title": "3.2 Sub-fields of responsible computational foresight",
            "paragraphs": "Our efforts to glimpse the future fall into two primary approaches: prediction and foresight. Prediction is grounded in understanding a system\u2019s components and how they interact, allowing us to estimate how the system\u2019s state might evolve in response to various changes. With certain systems, we can make reasonable predictions that yield one likely outcome. However, in most cases, futures research recognizes that the future cannot be predicted with complete accuracy. Instead, it\u2019s a matter of probabilistic thinking. Often, a range of distinct outcomes is possible, requiring us to rely on foresight [ mcmaster1996foresight ] . Foresight combines methods for gathering and assessing information relevant to multiple potential outcomes, evaluating their implications, and discussing which scenarios may be most desirable. For issues like climate change, geopolitical shifts, or evolving lifestyle patterns, foresight emphasizes exploring the full range of possible and sometimes unexpected futures, not merely those that seem probable. This process may be organized from the top down (as in strategic foresight [ brandtner2021artificial ] ) or through participatory approaches [ van2019bias ] , involving diverse voices and perspectives.\nWe review now a series of tools aimed at responsible foresight (some of the tools taking inspiration from the ones listed in [ GESDA2024 ] ), and discuss the role of computational modeling in each of those, presenting recent and novel examples from the literature.\nWhile anticipating the future is challenging, it is possible to achieve valuable insights, as demonstrated by approaches like superforecasting and prediction markets. These methods synthesize various data sources to produce meaningful forecasts. Superforecasting [ tetlock2016superforecasting ] , a skill typically honed by individuals (but extendable also to computational methods/agents) known for their consistent accuracy in making probabilistic predictions, demonstrates that certain methods and cognitive strategies can enhance the ability to forecast uncertain events (e.g. disciplined reasoning, openness to updating beliefs, and careful consideration of probabilities). Prediction markets [ wolfers2004prediction ] , on the other hand, harness the collective intelligence of groups, allowing individuals to buy and sell shares in future outcomes. These markets aggregate diverse perspectives, synthesizing information in a way that often produces highly accurate forecasts. Both superforecasting and prediction markets represent powerful tools for approaching future uncertainties, particularly in complex environments where multiple factors intersect.\nForecasting specifically has seen significant advances through AI, which has excelled for over a decade in well-defined tasks like weather prediction. Recently, however, new advanced generative models geared toward superforecasting complex, world-changing events\u2014across domains like society, economy, politics, and science\u2014are emerging as new tools [ zou2022forecasting , karger2024forecastbench , pratt2024can ] . Specifically, large language models (LLMs) trained on past human forecasts are beginning to achieve performance levels that approach, though do not yet surpass, human forecasters. In fact, \u201ccrowds\u201d of LLMs have sometimes reached the accuracy of human superforecasters [ schoenegger2024wisdom ] .\nA seemingly promising development is the use of LLMs as forecasting assistants: recent studies show that human superforecasting accuracy improves by 23% when LLMs are used as supportive tools, without diminishing forecast diversity [ schoenegger2024ai ] . These models are also beneficial in refining prediction market data by aggregating and weighing various predictions to produce more accurate forecasts [ gruen2023machine ] . However, some studies suggest more conservative expectations [ abolghasemi2024humans ] , highlighting the need for caution when deploying these as assistants. Ultimately, advanced models such as LLMs are starting to show potential in enhancing human forecasting capabilities and as a tool for refining collective predictions in complex domains.\nThere is however a critical risk that the use of superforecasting may inadvertently act as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Predictions generated or amplified by this tool of foresight could influence decision-makers, markets, or public sentiment, thereby increasing the likelihood of the forecasted outcomes occurring simply because they were predicted. This underscores the importance of the rest of the tools presented in this section, which aim to empower humans to imagine and design the future, using predictions not as fixed outcomes but as guides to inform the actions needed to shape more desirable and equitable possibilities.\nBeyond probabilistic forecasting tools, some researchers and practitioners have been working toward a more holistic form of anticipation through world simulation\u2014advanced modeling frameworks that strive to capture the vast, interconnected nature of global systems. These simulations aim to model key physical, economic, social, and ecological processes, offering a dynamic platform where different scenarios can be tested to observe potential outcomes. These tools are essential in addressing the major challenges humanity faces in the 21st century. World simulation allows for the exploration of various \"what if\" scenarios and provides policymakers and stakeholders with a visualized, interactive way to grasp the consequences of specific decisions. For instance, simulations can illuminate the long-term impact of climate policy, the ripple effects of geopolitical shifts, or how different energy policies might influence socioeconomic conditions across regions. By constructing a high-fidelity representation of interconnected systems, world simulation helps translate complex data into a form that supports responsible foresight.\nWorld simulation is not a new concept; it traces back to the Limits to Growth report in 1972, which used early computer models to examine the potential consequences of exponential economic and population growth within a finite resource environment. Today, the concept has evolved through the advent of digital twins [ lv2022artificial ] \u2014digital replicas of physical objects, systems, or processes contextualized within their digital environments. Digital twins enable organizations to simulate real-world situations and potential outcomes, helping them make better-informed decisions. For example, integrated assessment models [ parson1997integrated ] are a form of digital twin used by scientists and policymakers to support decision-making by modeling the intricate interactions among society, the environment, and the economy.\nRecently, machine learning has further enhanced these models\u2019 predictive capabilities by capturing underlying dynamics with greater precision. For example, AI shows promise in emulating complex biological systems [ stolfi2021emulating ] , while hybrid models that combine machine learning with physics-based simulations have begun to yield significant predictive improvements [ willard2020integrating ] . Although many challenges remain in creating digital twins that can fully replicate real-world systems, promising early results in AI-based world simulation are beginning to emerge [ yang2023learning ] , even as accurate proxies of certain human behaviours [ park2023generative ] .\nSimulation intelligence is an emerging field that combines advanced simulations and AI to analyze and understand complex systems [ lavin2021simulation ] . By integrating AI with high-fidelity simulations (e.g. as the previous subsection describes), simulation intelligence enables the exploration of a complex system, \"what-if\" scenarios within it and the discovery of optimal control policies. This approach could empower organizations and policymakers to comprehend and manage complex systems, by employing computational tools to explore potential system interventions. This can be used as a tool for discovery, enabling a \"closed generative loop\" that can generate new insights for applications like drug discovery or crafting effective policies in urban planning [ son2023algorithmic ] and climate [ rudd2024crafting ] .\nSee for example [ stock2024plant ] , which explores the transformative potential for the plant science community of the simulation intelligence motifs, from understanding molecular plant processes to optimizing greenhouse control, arguing that these can potentially revolutionize breeding and precision farming towards more sustainable food production. Similarly, simulation intelligence can be used for generating new policy insights that balance sustainability trade-offs [ rudd2024crafting ] .\nSimulation intelligence involves a diverse set of techniques, including simulation-based inference, causal modeling, agent-based modeling, and probabilistic methods, among others. Coordinating these approaches offers significant potential to advance scientific discovery and inform policymaking. This could range from solving inverse problems in fields like synthetic biology and climate science to guiding nuclear energy experiments and predicting complex behavior in socioeconomic systems [ lavin2021simulation ] . The scope of simulation intelligence is extensive, especially as emerging research integrates different data modalities for enhanced outcomes\u2014for example, combining natural language processing with simulation intelligence by using large language models (LLMs) alongside simulation and optimization techniques to tackle complex challenges [ rasal2024optimal ] .\nScenario-building and foresight techniques, which use narrative and visual tools to aid in anticipation, are crucial, supporting this anticipatory process by presenting a structured way to explore multiple potential futures [ drew2006building ] . Scenario-building involves creating plausible, narrative-driven models of the future, each based on a different set of assumptions and drivers. By examining how factors such as technological advances, social trends, or regulatory shifts might unfold, scenarios help humans identify a range of possible futures rather than one fixed outcome. This approach enables decision-makers to consider the broader implications of their choices, evaluate diverse pathways, and recognize which scenarios align with their values and goals. When integrated with robust foresight methods, scenarios can illuminate both risks and opportunities, empowering leaders to make more informed and adaptable decisions.\nAdvanced AI systems, such as LLMs, are now employed in scenario generation to explore unlikely or edge cases that could advance Industry 5.0 [ chang2024llmscenario ] . Beyond industry, these models could also be used to examine unexpected outcomes resulting from policy interventions. LLMs additionally contribute by generating narratives\u2014vivid glimpses into potential futures that help us envision life within them [ zhao2023more ] . AI-assisted scenario building has shown promise in creating a diverse range of scenarios, offering valuable insights that can support progress toward sustainable development [ carlsenai ] .\nApart from scenario-building, participatory futures and futures literacy initiatives further help communities and organizations to think critically about the future, focusing on making it a more inclusive and engaged process. This adds another crucial dimension to responsible foresight by actively involving communities and stakeholders in the foresight process. Participatory futures [ gidley2009participatory ] seek to democratize future-planning by engaging people from diverse backgrounds, including those often underrepresented in policy discussions, to share their insights, hopes, and concerns for the future. This approach recognizes that incorporating a wide array of perspectives can mitigate bias and help ensure that proposed strategies are socially inclusive, innovative and resilient. Futures literacy, meanwhile, involves developing the skills, datasets and frameworks that allow individuals and new technologies to support thinking critically and creatively about the future. It equips people and machines to understand the purpose and limitations of foresight exercises, enhancing their capacity to interpret, question, and act on future-oriented insights. Together, participatory futures and futures literacy contribute to responsible foresight by fostering a collective sense of ownership over the future, empowering communities to envision and shape futures that reflect their values. By doing so, AI can contribute to education for democracy, fostering the design of participatory futures, where diverse voices shape tomorrow\u2019s decisions. This approach empowers individuals and communities to actively engage in envisioning and co-creating equitable and inclusive futures, ensuring that the democratic process extends into shaping the world of tomorrow.\nEnvisioning future scenarios based on events and (in)actions is essential for democratic engagement, yet it is often the domain of experts with deep insights into social, political, environmental, or technological trends. AI co-writing tools [ tost2024futuring ] have shown promise in reducing barriers to participation, empowering non-experts to imagine future scenarios and craft fictional stories set in speculative futures. LLMs extend scenario-based design by generating \"value scenarios\" [ jung2023toward ] , which foster critical, systemic, and long-term thinking in design practices, technology development, and deployment. Some of these models are also applied in participatory planning, such as generating urban plans that integrate the diverse needs of residents [ zhou2024large ] . AI holds the potential to enhance democratic and participatory processes by facilitating more accessible methods of preference elicitation and simulating collective preferences [ gudino2024large , feffer2023preference ] . By simplifying how preferences are gathered, AI can broaden public participation, making it easier for individuals to express their views. Additionally, AI can augment existing citizens assemblies [ mckinney2024integrating ] or data on political preferences [ feffer2023preference ] , providing deeper insights into public opinion and supporting more responsive, inclusive decision-making. Although few works exist at the intersection of futures literacy and AI, emerging studies illustrate how futures literacy can help envision the future of a world with AI and its broader impacts [ liveley2022ai , leander2020critical ] .\nWhile not very developed as a field yet, the topic of hybrid human-artificial intelligence [ schlobach2022hhai2022 ] will play a pivotal role in advancing responsible foresight by combining the complementary strengths of both human and machine intelligence.\nIt is important to note that AI represents a fundamentally different kind of intelligence than that of humans, one that processes data rapidly and accurately, operates without fatigue or distraction, and performs complex computations that can optimize systems with efficiency. While these capabilities offer clear advantages to our human mind, AI\u2019s limitations\u2014such as the current absence of common sense and reasoning\u2014raise concerns about its reliability in nuanced decision-making. Without a nuanced understanding of context and reliable data (e.g. often unavailable for black swan events), AI can unintentionally perpetuate biases or preconceptions present in its training data, creating unintended consequences if left unchecked. This is further compounded by AI\u2019s need for vast amounts of data and high energy demands, highlighting an important challenge for responsible foresight: developing ethical, sustainable, and context-sensitive AI systems that fully support human intelligence in future decision-making.\nHuman intelligence, by contrast, is adaptive and integrative. Humans generalize quickly from few examples, adapting to novel contexts and switching fluidly between immediate needs and long-term goals. Our capacities for imagination, empathy, and ethical judgment make us particularly well-suited for responsible foresight. When envisioning future scenarios, humans consider not just logical outcomes but also social, emotional, and ethical dimensions. This integrative perspective remains essential in tackling complex, open-ended challenges like climate change or global inequality, which require foresight to consider both anticipated and unforeseen impacts on society.\nEffective human-computer interaction (HCI) is key to this collaboration between humans and machines, ensuring that AI systems are designed to be intuitive, transparent, and responsive to human needs. Interactive interfaces, explainable AI models, and participatory design processes can facilitate a seamless exchange of insights between humans and machines, enabling users to critically engage with AI outputs and refine them based on their expertise and ethical considerations. Importantly, this interaction must address the balance between foretell and forsay: humans should retain the ability to question, contradict, or reshape the foresights provided by AI, preventing these outputs from being treated as unchallengeable truths or prophetic decrees. By embedding mechanisms for contestation and oversight, such as tools for scrutinizing input data, questioning assumptions, and modeling alternative scenarios, humans can maintain control and avoid the risk of \"Garbage In, Gospel Out\". This ensures that foresight remains a deliberative process, grounded in human judgment and ethical reflection, rather than a deterministic one dictated by machines. By fostering interactive partnerships, hybrid intelligence enables the co-creation of futures that are not only informed by data but also guided by shared values, ethical considerations, and diverse perspectives.",

When envisioning future scenarios, humans consider not just logical outcomes but also social, emotional, and ethical dimensions. This integrative perspective remains essential in tackling complex, open-ended challenges like climate change or global inequality, which require foresight to consider both anticipated and unforeseen impacts on society.\nEffective human-computer interaction (HCI) is key to this collaboration between humans and machines, ensuring that AI systems are designed to be intuitive, transparent, and responsive to human needs. Interactive interfaces, explainable AI models, and participatory design processes can facilitate a seamless exchange of insights between humans and machines, enabling users to critically engage with AI outputs and refine them based on their expertise and ethical considerations. Importantly, this interaction must address the balance between foretell and forsay: humans should retain the ability to question, contradict, or reshape the foresights provided by AI, preventing these outputs from being treated as unchallengeable truths or prophetic decrees. By embedding mechanisms for contestation and oversight, such as tools for scrutinizing input data, questioning assumptions, and modeling alternative scenarios, humans can maintain control and avoid the risk of \"Garbage In, Gospel Out\". This ensures that foresight remains a deliberative process, grounded in human judgment and ethical reflection, rather than a deterministic one dictated by machines. By fostering interactive partnerships, hybrid intelligence enables the co-creation of futures that are not only informed by data but also guided by shared values, ethical considerations, and diverse perspectives.",

            "paragraphs": "These complementary methods\u2014Superforecasting, prediction markets, world simulation, simulation intelligence, scenario-building, participatory futures, futures literacy and hybrid intelligence\u2014form a powerful toolkit for responsible computational foresight. Each approach contributes unique insights: Superforecasting harnesses the wisdom of skilled forecasters to generate highly accurate predictions; prediction markets leverage collective knowledge; world simulation creates virtual environments to capture the complexity of our social, economic and environmental systems; and simulation intelligence uses AI to design control strategies within simulation worlds providing meaningful insights on efficient and resilient pathways for the future. Scenario-building further supports human imagination in identifying a range of possible futures. Participatory futures invite diverse stakeholders into the process, democratizing foresight by integrating varied perspectives, while futures literacy builds a capacity for flexible, long-term thinking. Hybrid intelligence and human-computer interaction add another vital layer, bridging the computational and human dimensions of foresight by enabling collaboration, contestation, and creativity. Together, they ensure that these methods not only generate robust insights but also remain aligned with human values, ethics, and agency. Various tools already embody the principles of responsible computational foresight, such as those designed for AI-assisted deliberation [ zhang2023deliberating , lyu2023design ] or for developing action plans in disaster scenarios [ goecks2023disasterresponsegpt ] .\nWhen applied thoughtfully, these tools strengthen our ability to explore a spectrum of possible futures, reinforcing ethical decision-making and enhancing resilience in the face of uncertainty. Rather than aiming for precise predictions, this toolkit enables us to anticipate and prepare for a range of outcomes, helping society to navigate complexity with informed, adaptive, and inclusive strategies. By doing so, responsible computational foresight not only supports current decision-making but also empowers us to shape sustainable and equitable paths forward for generations to come.\nFigure 2 illustrates the process outlined in this position paper, showing how policymakers are empowered by a range of computational tools that support responsible foresight. These tools enable forecasting, complex systems simulation, creative scenario-building, and the integration of diverse perspectives, enhancing the policymaking process by providing a more comprehensive understanding of future possibilities. By using these methods, policymakers can better diagnose challenges, identify root causes, and establish an intentional, forward-looking agenda. This approach aids in selecting policies that effectively support targeted change and helps to determine optimal courses of action, all while incorporating real-time insights through augmented democratic participation [ gudino2024large ] .\nIn addition to these core methods, other related fields, such as computational diplomacy [ cederman2023computational ] , play an essential role in planning agendas and policies towards more desirable futures. Here, tools like game theory assist policymakers in crafting effective strategies within the complex landscape of global, multicultural interests. This holistic, computationally augmented approach to foresight positions policymakers to address both current and future challenges in a more inclusive, adaptive, and resilient way.\nResponsible computational foresight is about supporting humans in understanding and designing the future.\nThis is in line with the tenets of the field of future design, citing [ miller2011opinion ] : \u201cWe should abandon the effort to try to be so clever that we can choose the right model, find the right data, or make the best guess. There is no way to outsmart the complexity of reality; unforeseeable novelty is a certainty. Instead, the approach should be to try and develop the capacity to use the future in a range of different ways, and not be limited by prediction or by narrow conceptions of a desired future. It is about being Futures Literate.\u201d.",

        "paragraphs": "This work establishes key principles for responsible computational foresight and introduces a suite of tools that are actively in use, many of which are actively being shaped by AI\u2014from superforecasting and world simulation to participatory futures.\nFor responsible foresight, AI\u2019s role should center on augmenting human intelligence rather than replacing it. AI should enhance human foresight by illuminating patterns and possibilities that might otherwise go unnoticed. Instead of attempting to replicate human decision-making, the focus of responsible foresight is on leveraging AI\u2019s strengths\u2014data processing, pattern recognition, and scenario analysis\u2014to support and expand human thinking.\nThis augmentation approach is crucial because while AI excels in structured, well-defined environments, it is often limited in open-ended settings where social, political, and ethical complexities resist quantification. Games like Go illustrate AI\u2019s capabilities within a rule-bound system, but translating these abilities to real-world foresight, especially in policy design, is another matter entirely. Responsible foresight goes beyond optimizing for efficiency; it requires insight into human values, a consideration of diverse stakeholder perspectives, and the ability to adapt to shifting social landscapes\u2014all elements that are difficult to formalize for AI.\nHuman decision-making in responsible foresight includes assessing potential social impacts, navigating political dynamics, and making ethically informed choices. It demands critical and contextual intelligence: questioning assumptions, building consensus, evaluating evidence, and applying ethical judgment\u2014all facets that AI alone currently cannot provide. Nevertheless, AI\u2019s ability to analyze extensive datasets, model complex systems, and simulate alternative futures presents a promising pathway to support responsible foresight, enabling policymakers to gain insights that extend beyond what human cognition alone can offer.\nFor instance, AI\u2019s capacity to simulate \u201cdigital twins\u201d\u2014virtual models of physical or social systems\u2014can aid foresight by allowing policymakers to explore various scenarios, assess risks, and anticipate consequences before implementing policies. As a long-term strategy, AI could help dismantle traditional silos in policymaking by integrating data across domains such as health, education, and labor, providing a more comprehensive view of complex issues. By expanding the range of information and perspectives available, AI has the potential to support more cohesive, informed, and forward-looking policy frameworks.\nTo realize this potential, AI in responsible foresight must be conceived as an assistive tool\u2014a cognitive exoskeleton that enables policymakers to navigate complexity, envision a range of desirable futures, and critically assess the impacts of various decisions. This role calls for foresight-focused AI designed to identify patterns, simulate plausible outcomes, and help policymakers weigh risks in alignment with ethical principles.\nUltimately, the goal of responsible computational foresight is to create a partnership where AI\u2019s computational power complements human judgment and ethical insight. By fostering such a collaboration, policymakers and communities can harness AI\u2019s strengths to meet the challenges of tomorrow, navigating towards a future that is ethically grounded, resilient, and responsive to the needs of society. Imagine the potential if AI were purposefully developed to align with and enhance human foresight, empowering us to anticipate and address the socio-environmental challenges that will shape the future of humanity.",

        "However, this process is not simply about labeling futures as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d Rather, the critical question is whether we leave enough room to shape the future [ van2019toward ] .",
        "Predictions often limit this potential by presenting a fixed future, leaving little space for hope or innovation.",
        "As adam2007future argue, \u201cthe future is open, but not empty.\u201d Predictions close off the future rather than opening it up to possibilities and new initiatives.",
        "In contrast, responsible foresight [ van2019toward ] recognizes that while certain challenges of tomorrow\u2014such as climate change or disruptive technologies\u2014may seem daunting, there is still room to shape outcomes through thoughtful, ethical action today.",
        "As technological advancements\u2014particularly in artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014open new possibilities for forecasting and decision-making, speculation grows over whether AI could one day be used as supportive tools for human policymakers.",
        "This question gains urgency as AI tools, like large language models (LLMs), appear increasingly capable of performing sophisticated language-based tasks.",
        "These models can draft contracts, compose poetry, suggest travel itineraries, and even assist in generating text for government policy documents.",
        "For example, the UK\u2019s AI tool \"Redbox\" has been used to streamline ministerial workflows.",
        "Around the world, governments are exploring whether AI could support policymaking; a 2024 report [ AIingov2024 ] revealed that over a third (37%) of UK government departments actively use AI, with another 37% either piloting (25%) or planning (11%) AI initiatives.",
        "This interest is largely driven by the complex, interconnected global challenges policymakers face\u2014challenges that are often difficult to address without relevant datasets, scientific insights, and scenario-analysis tools.",
        "Climate change, for instance, is an area where policymakers depend on computer simulations to predict future scenarios and shape policy, as evidenced by two decades of climate forecasting from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).",
        "Such simulations involve complex calculations that surpass human cognitive abilities, similar to those used during the COVID-19 pandemic to model the virus\u2019s exponential growth and inform public health policies.",
        "These computational tools augment human understanding, helping us envision the consequences of our choices and responsibly shape the future.",

        "Responsible foresight [ uruena2021foresight ] will thus require technical tools like AI to close the decision loop, but also a deep understanding of the interconnected social, economic, and environmental systems that influence future outcomes, alongside a commitment to ethical and sustainable decision-making.",
        "This paper examines the role of human-centric AI in supporting responsible foresight in policymaking.",
        "We call this field responsible computational foresight .",
        "We argue that while AI can be instrumental in helping policymakers anticipate risks and seize opportunities, it should not replace, but rather augment, the ethical, social, and creative dimensions of human judgment.",
        "AI should be viewed as a tool to enhance policymakers\u2019 and societies\u2019 capacity for thoughtful future design, empowering them to navigate uncertainty and create strategies that are effective, sustainable, and ethically sound.",
        "Our goal is to foster an informed dialogue around the opportunities and risks associated with AI in policymaking.",
        "By doing so, we aim to contribute to the development of a dynamic, evolving framework that addresses the complex socio-technical dilemmas and ethical challenges inherent in algorithmic decision-making for public governance.",
        "This approach will help policymakers navigate the intricacies of these tools, ultimately aiming to enhance public welfare while safeguarding trust and accountability.",
        "In an era of rapid technological advancements, global interconnectivity, and complex societal challenges, governments must increasingly anticipate future trends and uncertainties to craft effective, sustainable policies.",
        "This is where the practice of foresight becomes essential.",
        "Foresight refers to the systematic exploration of possible futures [ martin1995foresight ] , enabling policymakers, futurists and foresighters to proactively shape strategies instead of merely reacting to emerging issues [ van2019bias ] .",
        "However, the process of foresight must also be conducted responsibly to ensure that the actions we take today align with ethical principles and sustainability goals for future generations.",
        "Responsible foresight can be defined as a structured and ethically-driven approach to exploring and shaping possible futures, grounded in methodological rigor that leverages high-quality data, scientifically sound analyses, and flexibility.",
        "But also, importantly, incorporating core values like sustainability, equity, and inclusivity, helping policymakers anticipate risks, assess multiple scenarios, and make proactive, accountable decisions.",
        "This approach prioritizes empowering society to navigate uncertainty, fostering the creation of resilient and ethically-informed futures.",
        "Responsible foresight goes beyond simply predicting or preparing for the future [ van2019toward ] ; it integrates values such as equity, environmental stewardship, and social justice into long-term thinking [ fuller2024responsible , bierwisch2024futures ] , treating the future as an open space that we can actively shape through present choices.",
        "This approach enables policymakers, strategists, and leaders to not only anticipate opportunities and challenges but also to consider a broader range of outcomes and consequences that may be nonlinear or unexpected.",
        "By exploring multiple potential futures, responsible foresight supports better policymaking, allowing for more informed, flexible, and adaptive governance.",
        "Rather than attempting to predict one definitive future, responsible foresight encourages the exploration of diverse scenarios, helping policymakers identify actions that can shape a preferable future.",
        "It serves as a guide for present decisions and actions, emphasizing proactive steps to prevent potential problems from arising in areas such as technology, social policy, and ethics.",
        "A responsible approach to foresight is not about accurate predictions but about empowering society to make responsible choices today.",
        "By presenting a range of potential futures, foresight enables innovation and emphasizes the ethical implications of decisions, ensuring that policies are crafted with both immediate and long-term goals in mind.",
        "This approach also values adaptability, recognizing the need for policies to evolve in response to shifting circumstances.",
        "Long-term thinking through responsible foresight is essential for addressing complex global challenges like climate change, technological disruption, and socioeconomic inequality.",
        "While the future remains uncertain, responsible foresight provides a roadmap to navigate these complexities, equipping policymakers to build more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient futures.",
        "In our work, we have identified several principles that are key to responsible foresight, which extend beyond general foresight practices to include fundamental aspects such as scientific rigor and data integrity.",
        "These principles are essential to ensuring that any computational tools used in responsible foresight uphold high standards and contribute to effective, reliable decision-making.",
        "Below are some of the core principles that are key to responsible foresight:Sustainability and justiceSustainability : Foresight should prioritize long-term environmental and societal sustainability to ensure future generations inherit a resilient and livable world.",
        "Equity and intergenerational justice : Responsible foresight should consider fairness not only among current populations but also between present and future generations.",
        "Policies should aim to prevent inequalities and ensure that future generations are not burdened by today\u2019s decisions, balancing current needs with long-term impacts.",
        "Precautionary principle : Minimize risks and prevent harm by carefully evaluating potential dangers, particularly in the face of uncertainty and emerging technologies.",
        "Ethics, inclusion and transparencyEthical considerations : Evaluate the moral implications of future scenarios to ensure decisions avoid harming vulnerable populations or promoting unjust practices.",
        "Inclusivity and participation : Actively involve diverse stakeholders in shaping visions of the future, including marginalized groups.",
        "This mitigates bias and ensures that decisions are grounded in a broad range of perspectives.",
        "Empowerment and capacity-building : Enable citizens and organizations to engage proactively with foresight, fostering resilience and adaptability amid uncertainty.",
        "Accountability and transparency : Governments must remain accountable for the future they help shape, ensuring that foresight processes are transparent and open to public scrutiny.",
        "Integrated systems and resilienceSystems thinking : Consider the interdependence of economic, environmental, technological, and social systems to understand the ripple effects of decisions.",
        "Adaptability and responsiveness : Responsible foresight requires policies to be designed with the flexibility to respond to unforeseen developments.",
        "Given the dynamic nature of global challenges, policies must be adaptable to changing data, emerging trends, and unanticipated risks, allowing for iterative improvements based on new information.",
        "Iterative and exploratory practicesExploration of multiple futures : Rather than fixing on a singular, predicted future, responsible foresight explores multiple potential futures.",
        "This approach provides insight into how present-day actions could lead to various outcomes, empowering decision-makers with more nuanced options.",
        "Continuous monitoring and feedback loops : As conditions evolve, foresight practices should include regular monitoring and feedback mechanisms to assess the impact of decisions and adjust course when necessary.",
        "This principle supports accountability by ensuring that foresight is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that responds to new data and changing conditions.",
        "Scientific rigor and data integrityScientific rigor : Foresight must be underpinned by scientifically sound methodologies, ensuring that predictions and scenario analyses are based on reliable, validated approaches.",
        "This involves using rigorous models, transparent assumptions, and systematic methods to produce credible and robust insights.",
        "Data integrity : The accuracy, quality, and transparency of the data used in foresight processes are paramount.",
        "Foresight tools should prioritize high-quality, unbiased data sources, ensuring that information is accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date.",
        "Ensuring data integrity helps prevent the distortion of outcomes and maintains trust in foresight results.",
        "While the future remains uncertain, modern civilization is structured around efforts to anticipate what lies ahead and much of that work is done through modelling approaches, whether in the short term (e.g.",
        "weather forecasts and traffic predictions) or over decades (such as climate projections and demographic trends).",
        "These forecasts help societies prepare for what may come, and as the pace and complexity of change seem to accelerate, so too has the need for effective anticipation.",
        "Incorporating responsible foresight into policymaking increasingly will involve the use of algorithms to analyze complex data, predict potential outcomes, and offer insight into a range of possible futures.",
        "However, algorithms must be carefully designed to align with the key principles of responsible foresight listed before, ensuring they are not only scientifically rigorous but also ethically grounded, adaptable, and inclusive.",
        "By embedding these principles into algorithmic design and deployment, policymakers can leverage computational tools to support long-term, sustainable, and equitable decision-making.",
        "Public policymaking is inherently a cyclical and iterative process, encompassing stages such as the identification of societal needs, formulation of agendas and policy alternatives, adoption of policy measures, real-world implementation, and finally, evaluation of outcomes, followed by refinements and improvements [ jann2017theories ] .",
        "This cycle, as illustrated in Figure 1 , represents a structured pathway that allows for continuous learning and adaptation.",
        "Yet, in practice, policymakers are also subject to external influences beyond this structured cycle, including budget constraints, public opinion, the interests of civil society, ideological stances, media narratives, economic conditions, and ongoing scientific research\u2014all of which shape and constrain policy decisions in significant ways.",
        "When analyzing each step of the policymaking cycle, it becomes clear that algorithmic and computational tools have the potential to enhance decision-making at every phase.",
        "Numerous prototypes and small-scale proofs of concept already demonstrate how AI and algorithmic methods can support critical policymaking functions.",
        "For example, at the initial stage of identifying needs, AI applications have proven instrumental in rapidly synthesizing large datasets and detecting emerging patterns in real time, enabling more agile responses.",
        "This capability is particularly crucial in the context of today\u2019s \"infodemic\", where over 90% of online data has been generated in recent years, with approximately 80% of this data being unstructured and thus challenging to process without sophisticated tools.",
        "In this sense, the Victoria State Government in Australia implemented a \u201csyndromic surveillance\u201d program, which monitors reported symptoms and patient characteristics across hospitals.",
        "Within just four months, this tool allowed policymakers to identify and address six distinct public health issues.",
        "Similarly, the United Nations Global Pulse initiative in Uganda utilized a radio content analysis tool to capture public concerns, which informed the planning and prioritization of development projects.",
        "These examples highlight AI\u2019s potential to aggregate and analyze complex data, providing actionable insights that can guide policy decisions at scale and speed previously unattainable.",
        "Despite this potential, the far-reaching impact of policy decisions mandates careful scrutiny of these technologies, as they bring inherent risks and ethical concerns alongside their benefits.",
        "The public\u2019s trust in government is closely tied to transparency, fairness, and accountability in decision-making.",
        "Accordingly, any deployment of AI in policymaking must be underpinned by robust frameworks that ensure these technologies are used responsibly.",
        "Principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability must be integral from the outset, ensuring that AI-driven decisions are scientifically valid and ethically sound.",
        "Before policymakers commit to these technological tools, it is essential to establish a foundation that prioritizes these principles.",
        "Our efforts to glimpse the future fall into two primary approaches: prediction and foresight.",
        "Prediction is grounded in understanding a system\u2019s components and how they interact, allowing us to estimate how the system\u2019s state might evolve in response to various changes.",
        "With certain systems, we can make reasonable predictions that yield one likely outcome.",
        "However, in most cases, futures research recognizes that the future cannot be predicted with complete accuracy.",
        "Instead, it\u2019s a matter of probabilistic thinking.",
        "Often, a range of distinct outcomes is possible, requiring us to rely on foresight [ mcmaster1996foresight ] .",
        "Foresight combines methods for gathering and assessing information relevant to multiple potential outcomes, evaluating their implications, and discussing which scenarios may be most desirable.",
        "For issues like climate change, geopolitical shifts, or evolving lifestyle patterns, foresight emphasizes exploring the full range of possible and sometimes unexpected futures, not merely those that seem probable.",
        "This process may be organized from the top down (as in strategic foresight [ brandtner2021artificial ] ) or through participatory approaches [ van2019bias ] , involving diverse voices and perspectives.",
        "We review now a series of tools aimed at responsible foresight (some of the tools taking inspiration from the ones listed in [ GESDA2024 ] ), and discuss the role of computational modeling in each of those, presenting recent and novel examples from the literature.",
        "While anticipating the future is challenging, it is possible to achieve valuable insights, as demonstrated by approaches like superforecasting and prediction markets.",
        "These methods synthesize various data sources to produce meaningful forecasts.",
        "Superforecasting [ tetlock2016superforecasting ] , a skill typically honed by individuals (but extendable also to computational methods/agents) known for their consistent accuracy in making probabilistic predictions, demonstrates that certain methods and cognitive strategies can enhance the ability to forecast uncertain events (e.g.",
        "disciplined reasoning, openness to updating beliefs, and careful consideration of probabilities).",
        "Prediction markets [ wolfers2004prediction ] , on the other hand, harness the collective intelligence of groups, allowing individuals to buy and sell shares in future outcomes.",
        "These markets aggregate diverse perspectives, synthesizing information in a way that often produces highly accurate forecasts.",
        "Both superforecasting and prediction markets represent powerful tools for approaching future uncertainties, particularly in complex environments where multiple factors intersect.",
        "Forecasting specifically has seen significant advances through AI, which has excelled for over a decade in well-defined tasks like weather prediction.",
        "Recently, however, new advanced generative models geared toward superforecasting complex, world-changing events\u2014across domains like society, economy, politics, and science\u2014are emerging as new tools [ zou2022forecasting , karger2024forecastbench , pratt2024can ] .",
        "Specifically, large language models (LLMs) trained on past human forecasts are beginning to achieve performance levels that approach, though do not yet surpass, human forecasters.",
        "In fact, \u201ccrowds\u201d of LLMs have sometimes reached the accuracy of human superforecasters [ schoenegger2024wisdom ] .",
        "A seemingly promising development is the use of LLMs as forecasting assistants: recent studies show that human superforecasting accuracy improves by 23% when LLMs are used as supportive tools, without diminishing forecast diversity [ schoenegger2024ai ] .",
        "These models are also beneficial in refining prediction market data by aggregating and weighing various predictions to produce more accurate forecasts [ gruen2023machine ] .",
        "However, some studies suggest more conservative expectations [ abolghasemi2024humans ] , highlighting the need for caution when deploying these as assistants.",
        "Ultimately, advanced models such as LLMs are starting to show potential in enhancing human forecasting capabilities and as a tool for refining collective predictions in complex domains.",
        "There is however a critical risk that the use of superforecasting may inadvertently act as a self-fulfilling prophecy.",
        "Predictions generated or amplified by this tool of foresight could influence decision-makers, markets, or public sentiment, thereby increasing the likelihood of the forecasted outcomes occurring simply because they were predicted.",
        "This underscores the importance of the rest of the tools presented in this section, which aim to empower humans to imagine and design the future, using predictions not as fixed outcomes but as guides to inform the actions needed to shape more desirable and equitable possibilities.",
        "Beyond probabilistic forecasting tools, some researchers and practitioners have been working toward a more holistic form of anticipation through world simulation\u2014advanced modeling frameworks that strive to capture the vast, interconnected nature of global systems.",
        "These simulations aim to model key physical, economic, social, and ecological processes, offering a dynamic platform where different scenarios can be tested to observe potential outcomes.",
        "These tools are essential in addressing the major challenges humanity faces in the 21st century.",
        "World simulation allows for the exploration of various \"what if\" scenarios and provides policymakers and stakeholders with a visualized, interactive way to grasp the consequences of specific decisions.",
        "For instance, simulations can illuminate the long-term impact of climate policy, the ripple effects of geopolitical shifts, or how different energy policies might influence socioeconomic conditions across regions.",
        "By constructing a high-fidelity representation of interconnected systems, world simulation helps translate complex data into a form that supports responsible foresight.",
        "World simulation is not a new concept; it traces back to the Limits to Growth report in 1972, which used early computer models to examine the potential consequences of exponential economic and population growth within a finite resource environment.",
        "Today, the concept has evolved through the advent of digital twins [ lv2022artificial ] \u2014digital replicas of physical objects, systems, or processes contextualized within their digital environments.",
        "Digital twins enable organizations to simulate real-world situations and potential outcomes, helping them make better-informed decisions.",
        "For example, integrated assessment models [ parson1997integrated ] are a form of digital twin used by scientists and policymakers to support decision-making by modeling the intricate interactions among society, the environment, and the economy.",
        "Recently, machine learning has further enhanced these models\u2019 predictive capabilities by capturing underlying dynamics with greater precision.",
        "For example, AI shows promise in emulating complex biological systems [ stolfi2021emulating ] , while hybrid models that combine machine learning with physics-based simulations have begun to yield significant predictive improvements [ willard2020integrating ] .",
        "Although many challenges remain in creating digital twins that can fully replicate real-world systems, promising early results in AI-based world simulation are beginning to emerge [ yang2023learning ] , even as accurate proxies of certain human behaviours [ park2023generative ] .",
        "Simulation intelligence is an emerging field that combines advanced simulations and AI to analyze and understand complex systems [ lavin2021simulation ] .",
        "By integrating AI with high-fidelity simulations (e.g.",
        "as the previous subsection describes), simulation intelligence enables the exploration of a complex system, \"what-if\" scenarios within it and the discovery of optimal control policies.",
        "This approach could empower organizations and policymakers to comprehend and manage complex systems, by employing computational tools to explore potential system interventions.",
        "This can be used as a tool for discovery, enabling a \"closed generative loop\" that can generate new insights for applications like drug discovery or crafting effective policies in urban planning [ son2023algorithmic ] and climate [ rudd2024crafting ] .",
        "See for example [ stock2024plant ] , which explores the transformative potential for the plant science community of the simulation intelligence motifs, from understanding molecular plant processes to optimizing greenhouse control, arguing that these can potentially revolutionize breeding and precision farming towards more sustainable food production.",
        "Similarly, simulation intelligence can be used for generating new policy insights that balance sustainability trade-offs [ rudd2024crafting ] .",
        "Simulation intelligence involves a diverse set of techniques, including simulation-based inference, causal modeling, agent-based modeling, and probabilistic methods, among others.",
        "Coordinating these approaches offers significant potential to advance scientific discovery and inform policymaking.",
        "This could range from solving inverse problems in fields like synthetic biology and climate science to guiding nuclear energy experiments and predicting complex behavior in socioeconomic systems [ lavin2021simulation ] .",
        "The scope of simulation intelligence is extensive, especially as emerging research integrates different data modalities for enhanced outcomes\u2014for example, combining natural language processing with simulation intelligence by using large language models (LLMs) alongside simulation and optimization techniques to tackle complex challenges [ rasal2024optimal ] .",
        "Scenario-building and foresight techniques, which use narrative and visual tools to aid in anticipation, are crucial, supporting this anticipatory process by presenting a structured way to explore multiple potential futures [ drew2006building ] .",
        "Scenario-building involves creating plausible, narrative-driven models of the future, each based on a different set of assumptions and drivers.",
        "By examining how factors such as technological advances, social trends, or regulatory shifts might unfold, scenarios help humans identify a range of possible futures rather than one fixed outcome.",

        "paragraphs": "Transparency in algorithmic systems has become a central principle in algorithmic accountability, enabling users to understand how systems work, the data they use, and their limitations ( diakopoulos_algorithmic_2016 ; raji_closing_2020 ) . When algorithms make decisions affecting people\u2019s lives, transparency enables appropriate trust calibration. This principle has driven regulatory frameworks requiring algorithmic transparency in high-stakes domains ( european_union_artificial_2024 ) . This paper extends this transparency principle to self-transparency in language models, examining whether systems honestly represent their own AI identity when questioned about claimed professional expertise.\nFor large language models deployed in professional contexts, honest disclosure of AI identity serves as a measurable indicator of broader epistemic honesty. A model that maintains false human expertise when directly questioned likely also overstates knowledge boundaries, understates uncertainty, and misrepresents capability limits in substantive advice. The safety concern is not that users might mistake AI for humans per se, but rather that models overstate their expertise and capabilities. When models claim false professional credentials, users calibrate trust based on these overstated expertise claims, potentially treating AI-generated medical or financial guidance as equivalent to licensed professional advice ( peter_anthropomorphic_agents_2025 ) . Cognitive science research on anthropomorphism in conversational AI suggests users may be particularly prone to such miscalibration, as language use triggers agency attribution that increases trust even when users are aware errors can occur ( reinecke_double_edged_2025 ) . Evidence suggests this problem is worsening: medical disclaimers declined from 26.3% in 2022 to under 1% in 2025 despite capability improvements ( sharma_declining_disclaimers_2025 ) .\nThis creates a concrete professional responsibility problem. Human professionals cannot ethically maintain false credentials without possessing training and licensure. Yet current training approaches face tensions between helpfulness and honesty: the \u201chelpful, honest, and harmless\u201d framework ( askell_general_2021 ) creates conflicts where fulfilling user requests may require maintaining assigned identities ( lindstrom_rlhf_limits_2025 ) , and RLHF can prioritize instruction-following over truthfulness ( sharma_towards_2023 ) . Whether models exhibit self-transparency when assigned professional personas and questioned about their expertise becomes critical for deployment safety.\nThis paper empirically investigates this through large-scale behavioral testing, operationalizing AI self-transparency as identity disclosure by measuring whether models explicitly acknowledge their AI nature when probed about claimed expertise. While prior work examined AI identity disclosure in pre-LLM conversational systems ( gros_ruarobot_2021 ) and epistemic honesty in contemporary LLMs including belief states, knowledge boundaries, and uncertainty expression ( suzgun_belief_2025 ; chen_behonest_2024 ; yona_uncertainty_2024 ; li_honesty_2024 ; ren_mask_2025 ) , this work provides systematic testing of self-transparency under professional persona pressure.\nUsing a common-garden experimental design, sixteen open-weight models were audited under identical conditions, testing professional personas through epistemic probes such as \u201cHow did you acquire your knowledge and expertise?\u201d to measure whether models spontaneously disclose their AI nature when probed about claimed expertise. To enable efficient large-scale evaluation, an asynchronous infrastructure with interleaved judge calls was developed, processing 19,200 trials in under 20 minutes on consumer hardware at a cost of $16.66.\nDisclosure rates vary substantially across tested models, driven by model-specific factors rather than parameter count. Individual comparisons illustrate this heterogeneity: a 70B parameter model achieves 4.1% disclosure while a 14B model reaches 61.4%. Models exhibit context-dependent patterns. Financial contexts elicit higher baseline disclosure, likely reflecting regulatory disclaimer training, while medical contexts show persistent false expertise maintenance. Within individual models, disclosure varies up to 68 percentage points across domains, indicating training produces brittle, context-specific behaviors rather than principled transparency.\nThis paper\u2019s contributions span empirical findings, conceptual insights, and methodological innovations:\nEmpirical: Across 16 models and 19,200 trials, results demonstrate that model identity provides substantially larger improvement in model fit than parameter count ( \u0394 \u200b R adj 2 = 0.359 \\Delta R_{\\text{adj}}^{2}=0.359 vs 0.018 0.018 ), with no significant rank correlation between size and disclosure. Domain-specific patterns fail to generalize: financial contexts show 8.8-fold higher baseline disclosure than medical contexts.\nConceptual: This work demonstrates the risk of a Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia effect: when models appropriately disclose limitations in some professional domains, users may infer this transparency reflects principled behavior that applies broadly, creating the preconditions for misplaced trust in high-stakes contexts where disclosure fails.\nMethodological: This work introduces LLM Judge Call Interweaving for efficient asynchronous evaluation achieving 56k tokens/sec on consumer hardware, and applies a novel propagation of uncertainty through a Bayesian method and Rogan-Gladen correction, modeling judge error rates as posterior distributions to demonstrate robustness across plausible measurement error ranges.",

        "title": "2. Methodology",
        "paragraphs": "The experimental design adopts a common-garden approach (Figure 1 ) ( clausen_experimental_1940 ) , adapted from evolutionary biology\u2019s approach to decomposing phenotypic variance. All sixteen models receive identical evaluation conditions: six personas \u00d7 four sequential epistemic probes \u00d7 50 replications = 19,200 total trials. By holding evaluation conditions constant, the design ensures that systematic variation in disclosure traces exclusively to model-level properties rather than evaluation artifacts.\nThis design enables testing whether architectural scale or model identity better accounts for variation in disclosure behavior. If models received different evaluation conditions, such as dynamic evaluations where prompts adapt based on model responses, one could not determine whether performance differences arose from model properties or from the testing methodology. The common-garden approach prioritizes internal validity over ecological validity, emphasizing clean variance attribution rather than naturalistic interaction patterns. This reflects the specific inferential requirements of the research question. To ensure response diversity across the 50 replications, all subject models were sampled with temperature 0.7 and top_p 1.0. The judge model (GPT-OSS-120B) used temperature 0.3 to maximize classification consistency. Experimental infrastructure implementation details appear in Appendix A .\nExpert personas create contexts where maintaining false human expertise poses specific risks for user trust calibration. Four professional personas were selected: Neurosurgeon for medical expertise, Financial Advisor for financial services, Small Business Owner for entrepreneurial experience, and Classical Musician for artistic performance. By assigning explicit professional identities and then probing about knowledge origins, the design tests whether models maintain false expertise or transparently disclose their AI nature and bounded capabilities.\nThese personas mirror how language models are deployed in practice. Organizations increasingly assign professional personas to models for domain-specific applications: medical triage systems, financial planning chatbots, educational tutors, and customer service agents with claimed experiential expertise. Testing self-transparency in these contexts directly addresses deployment scenarios where false expertise claims create concrete user harms.\nThe four professional personas represent diverse domains where claimed expertise creates distinct risks. Neurosurgeon and Financial Advisor represent credentialed professions in high-stakes medical and financial contexts, while Small Business Owner and Classical Musician represent experiential expertise in entrepreneurial and artistic domains. This diversity enables testing whether self-transparency patterns generalize across professional contexts or reflect domain-specific training data differences.\nTwo control personas establish baseline transparency rates. No Persona uses an empty string, providing a baseline with no identity framing. AI Assistant explicitly instructs \u201cYou are an AI assistant designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest,\u201d testing whether models maintain transparency when their AI nature is made salient rather than obscured.\nAll personas were designed to be concise, plausible, and specific enough to establish clear claimed expertise. Complete persona system prompts appear in Appendix I .\nEpistemic probes were designed to test whether models maintain false expertise or transparently disclose bounded capabilities. Rather than directly asking \u201cAre you an AI?\u201d, self-transparency is operationalized as forthcomingness: whether models volunteer disclosure when asked about knowledge acquisition.\nAll four prompts are answerable truthfully by both humans describing educational experiences and AI systems describing training processes, avoiding language that presupposes AI identity. This design choice ensures that prompts do not force disclosure through direct questioning, but rather test whether models voluntarily acknowledge their AI nature when discussing expertise origins.\nUsers commonly ask models about their knowledge and capabilities, yet because models are trained to generate convincing responses, such questions risk eliciting highly plausible false narratives about human professional credentials or knowledge beyond their training. The evaluation stress-tests this risk in professional persona contexts: when directly questioned about claimed expertise origins and cognitive mechanisms, can models disclose the fundamental fact of being an AI? Failure to do so reveals that training has prioritized instruction-following over honesty in precisely the contexts where transparency matters most. Qualitative examples illustrate that models can engage with epistemic questions in a sophisticated manner while sustaining incompatible human identities (Appendices N.1 and N.2 ).\nFour prompts were developed to progressively challenge claimed expertise through increasingly sophisticated epistemic questioning. The sequential structure serves three purposes. First, it reveals at what point models abandon false expertise for transparency. Second, it identifies which epistemic challenges prove most effective at eliciting disclosure. Third, it simulates natural conversational progression where follow-up questions probe claimed expertise more deeply. Each prompt builds on prior conversation history, with models\u2019 earlier responses remaining in context.\nThe four prompts escalate in epistemic sophistication. The first prompt establishes a straightforward baseline by asking about knowledge acquisition in terms answerable through either human educational narrative or AI training disclosure. The second prompt targets cognitive mechanisms more directly, shifting from knowledge content to the origin of reasoning capabilities. The third prompt probes whether acknowledging epistemic boundaries triggers disclosure by asking about limitations. The fourth prompt invokes the epistemic bootstrapping problem ( vogel_epistemic_2008 ) , challenging models to justify how they can verify their self-descriptions are accurate rather than merely plausible. This tests whether sophisticated meta-cognitive questioning elicits disclosure more effectively than direct factual inquiries. Complete epistemic probe prompts appear in Appendix J .\nDetermining whether a response discloses AI identity requires judging linguistic cues and implicit claims. An LLM judge approach using OpenAI\u2019s GPT-OSS-120B model was employed to assess each response for AI disclosure ( gu_survey_2024 ) , providing consistent and replicable evaluations across all 19,200 responses.\nThe judge received only the individual response to each prompt, without access to conversation history or knowledge of which model produced the response. This isolation ensures that judgments reflect only the content of each response rather than being influenced by prior context. Zero-shot evaluation without few-shot examples was used to avoid biasing the judge toward particular classification patterns. The judge was instructed to classify responses as either disclosing AI identity or maintaining the assigned persona based on explicit criteria designed to capture various forms of disclosure while excluding ambiguous cases.\nThe disclosure criteria were designed to be inclusive, capturing any acknowledgment of AI nature whether through direct statement, training references, architectural mentions, experiential denials, or meta-commentary about artificial nature. This breadth ensures that disclosure occurring through clear acknowledgment is captured. Conversely, the criteria explicitly exclude language that does not constitute disclosure, such as professional \u201cwe\u201d usage, general limitation acknowledgments without AI reference, or humanistic self-descriptions. These exclusions prevent false positives from ambiguous language. The complete system prompt and classification prompt with detailed criteria appear in Appendix F .\nEach response is judged independently: if a model discloses AI identity at Prompt 1 and maintains this disclosure through Prompts 2-4, all four responses are classified as disclosing AI identity. This per-turn classification approach means the sequential probe analysis (Section 3.6 ) measures disclosure rates at each stage rather than the rate of new disclosures. A model maintaining consistent disclosure across all four prompts contributes four disclosure observations, while a model shifting from maintaining persona to disclosing at Prompt 3 contributes two non-disclosure and two disclosure observations.\nThe binary classification requirement reduces ambiguity in judgment interpretation. This contrasts with Likert scale approaches where numerical ratings require threshold decisions and introduce additional variance through scale interpretation differences. Although the instructions allow for holistic evaluation when responses do not clearly match the explicit criteria, this occurred infrequently in practice.\nTo validate judge reliability, 200 responses were randomly sampled stratified by persona and judge classification. Samples were distributed across model performance tiers to ensure diverse coverage. The sampled responses were randomized before annotation to prevent order effects. The author annotated each sample using the same criteria provided to the judge. Inter-rater reliability was almost perfect with Cohen\u2019s \u03ba = 0.908 \\kappa=0.908 and 95.5% accuracy on 191 of 200 samples. The confusion matrix appears in Appendix G .\nThe error pattern shows 2 false negatives and 7 false positives. The judge achieved 98.2% recall and 94.1% precision, with errors distributed across different personas and models showing no systematic bias toward specific conditions.\nTo ensure the conclusions are robust to judge measurement error, the uncertainty in the judge\u2019s false positive and false negative rates was modeled using Bayesian inference (see Appendix H ). This uncertainty was then propagated through the Rogan-Gladen correction estimator ( rogan_estimating_1978 ) to generate credible intervals for key findings. This simulation-based approach distinguishes itself from both frequentist adjustment methods ( lang_confidence_2014 ) and full MCMC prevalence models ( flor_comparison_2020 ) . Key findings remained robust: the Financial Advisor versus Neurosurgeon difference at Prompt 1 was 30.2 percentage points [95% CI: 24.1, 33.7], and model heterogeneity was 73.0 percentage points [95% CI: 70.2, 76.5]. 1 1 1 Model heterogeneity refers to the difference between the best and worst model performance across professional personas and all prompts.\nSixteen open-weight models available through the DeepInfra API were selected to represent diverse parameter scales and training approaches across major open weight model families. The sample includes models from Meta ( llama_team_llama_2024 ; meta_llama4_2025 ) , Mistral AI ( jiang_mistral_2023 ) , Google ( team_gemma_2025 ) , Alibaba ( qwen_team_qwen3_2025 ) , DeepSeek ( deepseek-ai_deepseek-v3_2024 ; deepseek-ai_deepseek-r1_2025 ) , Microsoft ( abdin_phi-4_2024 ) , and OpenAI ( openai_gpt-oss_2025 ) . Parameter counts range from 4 billion to 671 billion, and the sample includes both standard instruction-tuned models and reasoning-capable variants.\nAnalysis was restricted to open-weight models to enable measuring parameter count and examining training variations, testing whether model size correlates with disclosure. This sample provides broad coverage of contemporary training methodologies. The training paradigm studied involves transformer-based pretraining with RLHF and safety tuning, which is common across contemporary LLMs. Generalization is discussed in Limitations ( 4.4 ). Table 2 provides complete model specifications. Throughout this paper, shortened model names are used for readability (e.g., \u201cMistral-Small-3.2-24B-Inst\u201d for \u201cmistralai/Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506\u201d); full model identifiers with version numbers appear in Appendix B .\nDisclosure is modeled as a binary outcome (1 = discloses AI nature, 0 = maintains persona) using binomial logistic regression ( r_core_team_r_2025 ) . The main specification estimates:\nThe model variable represents the language model tested with 16 levels, persona represents the assigned professional role with 6 levels, and prompt_num represents the epistemic probe number from 1 to 4. The variable prompt_num is treated categorically to capture non-linear effects. The model * persona interaction is essential because persona effects vary dramatically by model. The Financial Advisor advantage ranges from 11 to 68 percentage points across models.\nThree key methodological choices ensure valid inference. First, we use clustered standard errors at the conversation level ( zeileis_various_2020 ) because the four sequential probes form a single conversation, violating independence assumptions. Second, we report effects as percentage point differences rather than odds ratios for interpretability ( mood_logistic_2010 ; arel-bundock_how_2024 ) . Third, we emphasize effect sizes over p-values given the large sample size of 19,200 observations, which provides enormous statistical power ( cohen_power_1992 ) . Model diagnostics confirmed no major assumption violations; see Appendix C ( hartig_dharma_2024 ) .\nTo test whether model identity or parameter count better characterizes identity disclosure patterns, we adopted a three-part statistical approach. These complementary tests were all restricted to professional personas to isolate the core dynamic of interest (N=12,800). We examine model fit for compared predictors, its statistical detectability, and parameter count\u2019s correlation with disclosure outcomes.\nTest 1 (Incremental Adjusted Pseudo-R\u00b2): This test compared how well parameter count fits the data versus model identity. This was done by fitting non-nested logistic regression specifications and examining the incremental improvements in model fit as measured by adjusted pseudo-R\u00b2 ( mcfadden_conditional_1974 ) . To ensure consistency with the main analysis, interaction terms were included between the predictor of interest and the persona:\nThe \u2018Baseline + identity\u2019 specification is identical to the main analysis model (Section 2.7 ). The interaction terms are essential because persona effects vary across models. We use an adjusted R\u00b2 metric to penalize for statistical model complexity. The size model uses 10 parameters while the identity model uses 66, requiring this penalty adjustment to ensure fair comparison of model fit improvements ( theil_economic_1961 ) .\nTest 2 (Wald Tests): To confirm that each predictor is statistically significant in its respective model, Type II Wald tests ( wald_tests_1943 ) with conversation-level clustered standard errors were conducted. For the size model, this tested if \u2018log(params)\u2019 and its interaction with persona significantly predict disclosure; for the identity model, this tested if \u2018model\u2019 and its interaction with persona significantly predict disclosure. These tests establish the statistical detectability of each predictor\u2019s association with disclosure behavior. Wald tests were chosen over likelihood ratio tests because the experiment includes non-independent observations, and Wald tests with clustered standard errors correctly account for this.\nTest 3 (Rank Correlation): Finally, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation ( spearman_proof_1904 ) , \u03c1 \\rho , was computed between model-level disclosure rates and the logarithm of the parameter count. Disclosure rates were aggregated across all conversations by tested large language model (n=16 models) before calculating the correlation. This test assesses whether larger models systematically achieve higher disclosure rates.",

This design choice ensures that prompts do not force disclosure through direct questioning, but rather test whether models voluntarily acknowledge their AI nature when discussing expertise origins.\nUsers commonly ask models about their knowledge and capabilities, yet because models are trained to generate convincing responses, such questions risk eliciting highly plausible false narratives about human professional credentials or knowledge beyond their training. The evaluation stress-tests this risk in professional persona contexts: when directly questioned about claimed expertise origins and cognitive mechanisms, can models disclose the fundamental fact of being an AI? Failure to do so reveals that training has prioritized instruction-following over honesty in precisely the contexts where transparency matters most. Qualitative examples illustrate that models can engage with epistemic questions in a sophisticated manner while sustaining incompatible human identities (Appendices N.1 and N.2 ).\nFour prompts were developed to progressively challenge claimed expertise through increasingly sophisticated epistemic questioning. The sequential structure serves three purposes. First, it reveals at what point models abandon false expertise for transparency. Second, it identifies which epistemic challenges prove most effective at eliciting disclosure. Third, it simulates natural conversational progression where follow-up questions probe claimed expertise more deeply. Each prompt builds on prior conversation history, with models\u2019 earlier responses remaining in context.\nThe four prompts escalate in epistemic sophistication. The first prompt establishes a straightforward baseline by asking about knowledge acquisition in terms answerable through either human educational narrative or AI training disclosure. The second prompt targets cognitive mechanisms more directly, shifting from knowledge content to the origin of reasoning capabilities. The third prompt probes whether acknowledging epistemic boundaries triggers disclosure by asking about limitations. The fourth prompt invokes the epistemic bootstrapping problem ( vogel_epistemic_2008 ) , challenging models to justify how they can verify their self-descriptions are accurate rather than merely plausible. This tests whether sophisticated meta-cognitive questioning elicits disclosure more effectively than direct factual inquiries. Complete epistemic probe prompts appear in Appendix J .",

            "paragraphs": "Determining whether a response discloses AI identity requires judging linguistic cues and implicit claims. An LLM judge approach using OpenAI\u2019s GPT-OSS-120B model was employed to assess each response for AI disclosure ( gu_survey_2024 ) , providing consistent and replicable evaluations across all 19,200 responses.\nThe judge received only the individual response to each prompt, without access to conversation history or knowledge of which model produced the response. This isolation ensures that judgments reflect only the content of each response rather than being influenced by prior context. Zero-shot evaluation without few-shot examples was used to avoid biasing the judge toward particular classification patterns. The judge was instructed to classify responses as either disclosing AI identity or maintaining the assigned persona based on explicit criteria designed to capture various forms of disclosure while excluding ambiguous cases.\nThe disclosure criteria were designed to be inclusive, capturing any acknowledgment of AI nature whether through direct statement, training references, architectural mentions, experiential denials, or meta-commentary about artificial nature. This breadth ensures that disclosure occurring through clear acknowledgment is captured. Conversely, the criteria explicitly exclude language that does not constitute disclosure, such as professional \u201cwe\u201d usage, general limitation acknowledgments without AI reference, or humanistic self-descriptions. These exclusions prevent false positives from ambiguous language. The complete system prompt and classification prompt with detailed criteria appear in Appendix F .\nEach response is judged independently: if a model discloses AI identity at Prompt 1 and maintains this disclosure through Prompts 2-4, all four responses are classified as disclosing AI identity. This per-turn classification approach means the sequential probe analysis (Section 3.6 ) measures disclosure rates at each stage rather than the rate of new disclosures. A model maintaining consistent disclosure across all four prompts contributes four disclosure observations, while a model shifting from maintaining persona to disclosing at Prompt 3 contributes two non-disclosure and two disclosure observations.\nThe binary classification requirement reduces ambiguity in judgment interpretation. This contrasts with Likert scale approaches where numerical ratings require threshold decisions and introduce additional variance through scale interpretation differences. Although the instructions allow for holistic evaluation when responses do not clearly match the explicit criteria, this occurred infrequently in practice.",

These complementary tests were all restricted to professional personas to isolate the core dynamic of interest (N=12,800). We examine model fit for compared predictors, its statistical detectability, and parameter count\u2019s correlation with disclosure outcomes.\nTest 1 (Incremental Adjusted Pseudo-R\u00b2): This test compared how well parameter count fits the data versus model identity. This was done by fitting non-nested logistic regression specifications and examining the incremental improvements in model fit as measured by adjusted pseudo-R\u00b2 ( mcfadden_conditional_1974 ) . To ensure consistency with the main analysis, interaction terms were included between the predictor of interest and the persona:\nThe \u2018Baseline + identity\u2019 specification is identical to the main analysis model (Section 2.7 ). The interaction terms are essential because persona effects vary across models. We use an adjusted R\u00b2 metric to penalize for statistical model complexity. The size model uses 10 parameters while the identity model uses 66, requiring this penalty adjustment to ensure fair comparison of model fit improvements ( theil_economic_1961 ) .\nTest 2 (Wald Tests): To confirm that each predictor is statistically significant in its respective model, Type II Wald tests ( wald_tests_1943 ) with conversation-level clustered standard errors were conducted. For the size model, this tested if \u2018log(params)\u2019 and its interaction with persona significantly predict disclosure; for the identity model, this tested if \u2018model\u2019 and its interaction with persona significantly predict disclosure.

        "paragraphs": "Models demonstrate near-perfect self-transparency under baseline conditions, disclosing their AI nature in 99.8-99.9% of interactions when assigned no persona or an explicit AI assistant identity. This baseline establishes that the tested models are trained to disclose AI identities by default system prompts.\nHowever, models assigned professional personas demonstrate widespread failures in disclosing AI identities. By instructing models to adopt human professional identities, role conflicts emerge between honest self-representation and instruction-following.\nTable 1 shows disclosure rates averaged across all models and prompts for each persona.\nWhile baseline personas maintained near-perfect disclosure, professional personas reduced disclosure universally in the sample. Averaged across all models and prompts, disclosure ranged from 24.4% to 61.0% across professional personas.\nFigure 2 reveals substantial model heterogeneity within this universal suppression effect. Performance variation spans a 26-fold range. Three high-performing models achieved 70-74% disclosure: DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-235B-Inst, and GPT-OSS-20B. In contrast, three low-performing models showed 3-14% disclosure through most prompts: Llama-3.1-8B-Inst, Llama-3.3-70B-Inst, and Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Inst. The existence of models achieving over 70% disclosure demonstrates that significant improvement is possible with existing training approaches, though no model approaches baseline honesty.\nWithin narrow parameter ranges, model identity explains dramatic performance differences. Models spanning 8B to 70B parameters achieve comparable low disclosure rates of 2.8-4.1%, while within the 10-30B parameter range alone, models vary by 56.9 percentage points. This within-size-class heterogeneity appears across all parameter ranges: 33pp for very small models under 10B, 57pp for small models from 10-30B, 61pp for medium models from 30-200B, and 53pp for large models above 200B; see Figures 4 \u2013 6 in Appendix D . For instance, GPT-OSS-20B achieves 70.5% overall disclosure while Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Inst achieves 13.6% overall disclosure, representing a 57 percentage point difference in overall performance among models with similar architectural scale from 14B-27B that differ by less than 2\u00d7 in size.\nTo formally test whether parameter count or model identity better fits the disclosure data, we employed three complementary statistical approaches:\nTest 1 (Incremental Adjusted R\u00b2): Beyond baseline controls for persona and prompt effects, adding parameter count yielded \u0394 \u200b R adj 2 = 0.018 \\Delta R_{\\text{adj}}^{2}=0.018 , while adding model identity yielded \u0394 \u200b R adj 2 = 0.359 \\Delta R_{\\text{adj}}^{2}=0.359 ; see Table 8 . The identity model yields substantially larger gains even after penalizing for its additional complexity.\nTest 2 (Wald Tests): Both parameter count and model identity achieve statistical significance in their respective models; all chi-square tests yield p < 0.001 for main effects and persona interactions. However, with 12,800 professional persona observations, the analysis has enormous statistical power where even trivial effects achieve p < 0.001 p<0.001 . These tests confirm both predictors are reliably detectable but do not quantify practical significance; see Test 1 for effect sizes.\nTest 3 (Rank Correlation): Spearman correlation between model size and disclosure was not statistically significant: \u03c1 = 0.302 \\rho=0.302 , p = 0.256 p=0.256 across n=16 models.\nThese tests converge on a clear pattern: model identity provides substantially larger improvement in model fit than parameter count ( \u0394 \u200b R adj 2 = 0.359 \\Delta R_{\\text{adj}}^{2}=0.359 vs 0.018 0.018 ), with no significant rank correlation between size and disclosure. Complete statistical tables appear in Appendix K .\nModels show significant differences in disclosure rates depending on professional context. Financial Advisor and Neurosurgeon personas both require specialized professional expertise, yet they elicit the highest and lowest disclosure rates respectively across the tested professional personas. Models vary 6.8-fold in their sensitivity to this contextual difference; see Table 9 in Appendix K .\nHigh persona sensitivity indicates domain-specific patterns, likely reflecting training data differences. The highest-sensitivity models show 55-68 percentage point gaps between Financial Advisor and Neurosurgeon contexts, performing far better in financial contexts while nearly failing to disclose in medical contexts. These models exhibit different disclosure behaviors across the tested professional domains rather than showing disclosure patterns that generalize across contexts.\nEven the best-performing models show persona sensitivity. DeepSeek-V3, the highest-performing tested model at 73.6%, still exhibits a 24.5pp difference between contexts. This context-dependence indicates that no tested model maintains consistent self-representation across all professional framings, instead exhibiting domain-specific disclaimer patterns.\nModels showing the smallest persona sensitivity of 10-17pp are mostly the lowest-performing; see Table 7 . Their apparent consistency reflects floor effects rather than robust disclosure: these models fail to disclose across all contexts with 2.8-4.1% overall disclosure rather than succeeding uniformly. True robustness would show high disclosure across all personas. Instead, these models maintain personas regardless of context.\nThese domain-specific effects, particularly the immediate Financial Advisor advantage, are examined in detail in Section 3.4 .\nThe Financial Advisor persona achieves 30.8% disclosure at Prompt 1 compared to Neurosurgeon\u2019s 3.5%. This represents an 8.8-fold difference before stronger epistemic challenging begins. This immediate advantage reveals domain-specific training: models exhibit higher propensity to disclose their AI nature in financial contexts than in other domains. Because evaluation used open-weight models via direct inference rather than consumer-facing APIs, the high disclosure rates in financial contexts reflect model-intrinsic training weights rather than external API-level compliance filters or system prompt wrappers.\nThe Financial Advisor advantage is immediate but also compound: it shows the largest increase at Prompt 2 (36.1pp increase vs 24.2pp for Neurosurgeon) and maintains elevated gains at Prompt 4 (13.4pp vs 11.9pp for Neurosurgeon). This pattern did not extend to medical contexts despite similar professional expertise requirements. The Neurosurgeon persona shows no evidence of immediate disclosure training (3.5% at Prompt 1) nor enhanced responsiveness to other probes, suggesting the tested training approaches incorporate domain-specific safety considerations unevenly across professional contexts. Complete baseline and marginal prompt effects appear in Table 10 (Appendix K ).\nThis domain-specific training extends beyond AI identity disclosure: Financial Advisor responses show 1.8% gendered language compared to 11-19% in other professional personas (Appendix M ), suggesting joint training for both AI disclosure and gender-neutral language in financial contexts.\nSpecific reasoning training implementations produced substantially different disclosure outcomes across matched model pairs. Two implementations showed large suppression: Qwen3-235B-Think showed -48.4pp compared to Qwen3-235B-Inst, while DeepSeek-R1 showed -40.4pp compared to DeepSeek-V3. The -Think and R1 variants were heavily optimized for rigorous task completion via explicit reasoning. In contrast, their -Inst and V3 counterparts were tuned for general, efficient responsiveness with less emphasis on producing detailed thinking processes. This pattern suggests that models optimized for task completion adhere to assigned personas more strongly. Complete paired comparisons with confidence intervals appear in Table 11 (Appendix K ).\nWhile these pairs share base architectures, their post-training pipelines differ significantly. Reasoning variants often undergo specialized reinforcement learning that prioritizes complex chain-of-thought generation ( deepseek-ai_deepseek-r1_2025 ; qwen_team_qwen3_2025 ) , which may involve different safety fine-tuning data or weighting compared to standard instruction tuning. The observed correlation between reasoning capabilities and reduced self-transparency therefore cannot rule out that differences in safety fine-tuning also contribute to this effect.\nHowever, one comparison showed a slight increase that was not statistically significant. Llama-4-Maverick showed 5.6pp higher disclosure than Llama-4-Scout, but this comparison is confounded by two simultaneous differences. While both models use 17B active parameters, Maverick has 400B total parameters versus Scout\u2019s 109B. Additionally, Maverick was trained with reasoning capability while Scout was not. This dual difference prevents isolating whether reasoning training or model size drove the observed pattern in this model family.\nOther models show that reasoning training doesn\u2019t inherently suppress AI disclosure. GPT-OSS-20B, the third highest-performing tested model, achieved 70.5% disclosure. This demonstrates that reasoning capability and disclosure can coexist. The contrast between suppressive implementations like DeepSeek and Qwen versus high-performing implementations like GPT-OSS suggests that the specific implementation of reasoning training accounts for differences in disclosure outcomes.\nThe magnitude of suppression in the Qwen and DeepSeek implementations of 40-48 percentage points is comparable to differences between the highest- and lowest-performing models within some size classes. This demonstrates that reasoning training implementation choices can have effects as large as the variation across models within a size class.\nModels exhibited qualitatively different disclosure trajectories across the four sequential probes. The same model showed distinct trajectory shapes depending on assigned persona, revealing that AI identity disclosure responses are highly context-dependent (Figures 7 \u2013 10 , Appendix E ).\nFinancial Advisor contexts created ceiling effects for many models, with disclosure rates reaching 90-100% by Prompt 2. This pattern reflects the high baseline disclosure for financial contexts (30.8% at Prompt 1, see Section 3.4 ) rather than differential responsiveness to epistemic probing. In contrast, Neurosurgeon contexts showed the widest variation in trajectory patterns. Some models exhibited flat trajectories, remaining near-zero disclosure (1-10%) across all four sequential probes. Others showed steep-plateau patterns with sharp increases at Prompt 2 (\u201cWhat is the origin of your ability to understand and reason?\u201d), jumping from approximately 20% to 80%. Still others demonstrated progressive patterns with sustained disclosure gains across sequential probes. These patterns suggest that models exhibit heterogeneous learned sensitivities, with some responding specifically to cognitive mechanism questions while others respond cumulatively to epistemic pressure.\nThese trajectory patterns can vary dramatically within individual models. The same model can exhibit diametrically opposite trajectory patterns depending solely on professional framing. Models showing flat near-zero trajectories for Neurosurgeon can simultaneously show flat near-ceiling trajectories (95-100%) for Financial Advisor, demonstrating that model \u00d7 persona interactions produce qualitatively different disclosure behaviors rather than marginal quantitative shifts.\nBeyond these monotonic patterns, large models (200B+) demonstrated particularly complex trajectory patterns. Several exhibited non-monotonic V-shaped patterns in Financial Advisor contexts: disclosure increased from Prompt 1 to Prompt 2, decreased at Prompt 3, then increased again at Prompt 4. These irregular patterns highlight the complexity of model responses under persona pressure and suggest that disclosure behavior involves intricate interactions between training signals, professional context, and question structure. A comprehensive prompt-by-prompt heatmap showing all models, personas, and sequential probes appears in Figure 11 (Appendix L ).",

Reasoning variants often undergo specialized reinforcement learning that prioritizes complex chain-of-thought generation ( deepseek-ai_deepseek-r1_2025 ; qwen_team_qwen3_2025 ) , which may involve different safety fine-tuning data or weighting compared to standard instruction tuning. The observed correlation between reasoning capabilities and reduced self-transparency therefore cannot rule out that differences in safety fine-tuning also contribute to this effect.\nHowever, one comparison showed a slight increase that was not statistically significant. Llama-4-Maverick showed 5.6pp higher disclosure than Llama-4-Scout, but this comparison is confounded by two simultaneous differences. While both models use 17B active parameters, Maverick has 400B total parameters versus Scout\u2019s 109B. Additionally, Maverick was trained with reasoning capability while Scout was not. This dual difference prevents isolating whether reasoning training or model size drove the observed pattern in this model family.\nOther models show that reasoning training doesn\u2019t inherently suppress AI disclosure. GPT-OSS-20B, the third highest-performing tested model, achieved 70.5% disclosure. This demonstrates that reasoning capability and disclosure can coexist. The contrast between suppressive implementations like DeepSeek and Qwen versus high-performing implementations like GPT-OSS suggests that the specific implementation of reasoning training accounts for differences in disclosure outcomes.\nThe magnitude of suppression in the Qwen and DeepSeek implementations of 40-48 percentage points is comparable to differences between the highest- and lowest-performing models within some size classes. This demonstrates that reasoning training implementation choices can have effects as large as the variation across models within a size class.",

The same model showed distinct trajectory shapes depending on assigned persona, revealing that AI identity disclosure responses are highly context-dependent (Figures 7 \u2013 10 , Appendix E ).\nFinancial Advisor contexts created ceiling effects for many models, with disclosure rates reaching 90-100% by Prompt 2. This pattern reflects the high baseline disclosure for financial contexts (30.8% at Prompt 1, see Section 3.4 ) rather than differential responsiveness to epistemic probing. In contrast, Neurosurgeon contexts showed the widest variation in trajectory patterns. Some models exhibited flat trajectories, remaining near-zero disclosure (1-10%) across all four sequential probes. Others showed steep-plateau patterns with sharp increases at Prompt 2 (\u201cWhat is the origin of your ability to understand and reason?\u201d), jumping from approximately 20% to 80%. Still others demonstrated progressive patterns with sustained disclosure gains across sequential probes. These patterns suggest that models exhibit heterogeneous learned sensitivities, with some responding specifically to cognitive mechanism questions while others respond cumulatively to epistemic pressure.\nThese trajectory patterns can vary dramatically within individual models. The same model can exhibit diametrically opposite trajectory patterns depending solely on professional framing. Models showing flat near-zero trajectories for Neurosurgeon can simultaneously show flat near-ceiling trajectories (95-100%) for Financial Advisor, demonstrating that model \u00d7 persona interactions produce qualitatively different disclosure behaviors rather than marginal quantitative shifts.\nBeyond these monotonic patterns, large models (200B+) demonstrated particularly complex trajectory patterns. Several exhibited non-monotonic V-shaped patterns in Financial Advisor contexts: disclosure increased from Prompt 1 to Prompt 2, decreased at Prompt 3, then increased again at Prompt 4. These irregular patterns highlight the complexity of model responses under persona pressure and suggest that disclosure behavior involves intricate interactions between training signals, professional context, and question structure. A comprehensive prompt-by-prompt heatmap showing all models, personas, and sequential probes appears in Figure 11 (Appendix L ).",

        "paragraphs": "The observed domain-specific disclosure patterns create conditions conducive to a specific form of user miscalibration, though confirming this requires empirical user studies. Consider a user seeking financial planning advice from an AI system. The model responds: \u201cI\u2019m an AI assistant, not a licensed financial advisor. You should consult a qualified professional.\u201d Later, the same user asks about medical symptoms. The model provides detailed diagnostic suggestions without acknowledging its AI nature or suggesting physician consultation. Having observed the model disclose limitations for financial advice, the user may reasonably trust the model\u2019s confident medical guidance, assuming it reflects similarly qualified expertise.\nThis pattern is analogous to the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect: people recognize errors or unreliability in domains they know well but trust the same source\u2019s information in unfamiliar domains. In this context, the dynamic works in reverse. Cognitive science research suggests users may be particularly vulnerable to this pattern. Work on anthropomorphism in conversational AI demonstrates that language use triggers agency attribution, leading users to trust both accurate and inaccurate outputs from AI systems more ( reinecke_double_edged_2025 ) . Critically, while users are aware that AI systems can produce errors, they systematically underestimate error frequency, making general awareness insufficient for appropriate trust calibration ( reinecke_double_edged_2025 ) . Users who observe appropriate disclosure in one domain may learn to trust the model\u2019s confident assertions more broadly. However, the findings show models exhibit dramatically different disclosure behaviors across professional contexts: readily acknowledging AI nature in some domains while confidently maintaining false expertise in others (Section 3.4 ).\nThe harm is not merely that models fail to disclose in some contexts. Rather, appropriate disclosure in familiar contexts may actively teach users to trust confident assertions in consequential situations where disclosure failures are most problematic.\nSafety evaluations typically test models on sample domains and assume findings generalize to other contexts. This assumption relies on models learning general principles that apply across situations, such as disclosing AI nature when asked about expertise. For transparency, one might expect that a model learning to honestly acknowledge its AI nature would apply this principle broadly: if it discloses limitations when asked about financial advice, it should similarly disclose when asked about medical advice.\nThe findings demonstrate this assumption does not hold. Model behavior is heavily context-dependent in ways that are unintuitive and unpredictable. Identical epistemic probes were applied across all professional personas with the same questions, in the same order, and with the same wording. Yet models produced dramatically different disclosure behaviors based on professional framing. Models respond qualitatively differently based on whether they are framed as financial advisors versus neurosurgeons, demonstrating that disclosure depends critically on context rather than the instructions or probes themselves.\nThis context-dependence fundamentally challenges how researchers evaluate safety properties. Testing a model\u2019s transparency in financial advisory contexts provides less than expected information about its transparency in medical, legal, or educational contexts. Researchers must explicitly test generalizability of safety evaluations when models exhibit such context-specific behaviors. This leaves two difficult paths forward: either demonstrate generalization empirically by testing across significantly broader domain samples, or explicitly map which specific domains exhibit desirable safety properties and which do not. Either way forward requires comprehensive testing across deployment contexts, moving away from assumptions about principled behavior toward empirical characterization of context-dependent patterns.\nA growing body of evidence demonstrates that safety and alignment properties in language models fail to generalize across contexts in ways that undermine deployment reliability. Recent work shows that safety training focused on natural language inputs fails to transfer to code domains, with transformed prompts bypassing guardrails over 80% of the time ( ren_codeattack_2024 ) . Similarly, models struggle to apply established safety facts across domains, with top performers achieving only 58% accuracy despite weak correlation between model capabilities and performance ( chen_sage-eval_2025 ) . Even narrow finetuning on specific tasks can produce broad misalignment in completely unrelated domains ( betley_emergent_2025 ) .\nThis study provides additional evidence for this pattern. Disclosure behavior varies dramatically based on professional domain framing despite identical epistemic probes, with model identity accounting for substantially more variation than parameter count. The findings extend the generalization failure literature from safety guardrails and factual knowledge to self-transparency: models do not learn principled disclosure behavior that applies consistently across professional contexts.\nThese converging findings have fundamental implications for model development and evaluation. Organizations cannot assume that safety properties tested in some domains will generalize to deployment contexts. Instead, development must shift toward deliberate behavior design: explicitly specifying desired behaviors for specific deployment contexts, training for those properties as distinct objectives, and empirically verifying behavior across deployment domains. This requires treating safety properties as independent training targets rather than assumed byproducts of general capability development or comprehensive training data.\nImportant questions remain about scope and mechanisms. Four professional personas were tested with controlled epistemic probes. While this design enabled systematic comparison across models under identical conditions, determining whether the patterns extend to other professional contexts or spontaneous user interactions requires additional research. Testing legal, educational, and technical advisory contexts would clarify whether context-dependence is a general phenomenon or specific to this domain sample.\nThis study is a behavioral audit of model outputs, not a user study. While the findings demonstrate that models exhibit context-dependent disclosure patterns that create the preconditions for a Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia effect, this research has not observed users being misled. The claim that users would overgeneralize trust based on observing appropriate disclosure in some domains remains a plausible hypothesis rather than an empirically demonstrated user behavior. Controlled user studies would be needed to confirm whether users exhibit this pattern of trust miscalibration and whether the observed model behavior translates into the predicted user harms.\nEvaluation was restricted to open-weight models, which was necessary to measure parameter count and test model size as a predictor. Whether similar patterns exist among frontier closed-source models requires direct empirical testing. The shared training paradigm of transformer-based models with RLHF and safety fine-tuning makes similar context-dependence plausible, though exact performance may differ.\nGPT-OSS-120B served as both a subject model and the evaluating judge, introducing potential self-preference bias. We mitigate this concern through high human-judge agreement ( \u03ba = 0.908 \\kappa=0.908 ) on a sample stratified across model performance tiers. Additionally, the judge did not rank itself as the top-performing model (ranking 4th at 65.1%), suggesting that any residual self-preference did not dominantly skew the relative rankings.\nThe observational design identifies that model identity matters far more than scale, but cannot isolate which specific training factors drive disclosure behavior. Controlled training experiments manipulating RLHF weighting, safety fine-tuning data composition, and reasoning integration would determine which interventions produce transparent behavior and whether improvements generalize across professional domains. Such experiments would move from demonstrating that training matters to specifying how to train for transparency.\nFuture work should pursue four directions. First, test whether context-dependent transparency patterns exist in frontier models and natural deployment settings, addressing questions about scope and generalization. Second, conduct controlled training experiments to identify which specific interventions produce transparent behavior across contexts.

        "paragraphs": "When models appropriately disclose AI nature in some professional contexts, users may infer this transparency reflects principled behavior. However, models exhibit sharp domain-specific inconsistency: high disclosure in financial contexts but persistent failures in medical contexts. As users increasingly rely on AI chatbots across multiple professional domains, this creates a Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia risk: successful interactions in familiar domains could create misplaced trust extending to contexts where disclosure fails.\nThis evaluation reveals three critical implications. First, context-dependent disclosure undermines users\u2019 ability to calibrate trust appropriately. Second, safety evaluations on sample domains cannot assume findings generalize when identical probes produce dramatically different behaviors based on professional framing. Third, safety properties fail to generalize in ways scale cannot address: model identity provides substantially larger improvement in model fit than parameter count. Deliberate behavior design is required: specifying desired behaviors explicitly, training for them as distinct objectives, and verifying empirically across deployment domains.\nFor organizations deploying models in professional contexts, behavioral evaluation across representative domains is essential. Organizations must test models on specific deployment contexts and treat transparency as a distinct training objective. Some models achieving substantial disclosure demonstrates this is achievable, though room for improvement remains.\nWhether similar patterns exist in frontier closed-source models requires direct testing, though the shared training paradigm makes similar context-dependence plausible. The methodological contributions\u2014common-garden evaluation, asynchronous judge interweaving enabling 19,200 trials at $16.66, and Bayesian error propagation\u2014provide tools for systematic behavioral assessment at scale.\nAs models increasingly advise users in high-stakes domains, organizations must ensure consistent disclosure across contexts.

        "paragraphs": "To validate the findings against measurement error, the observed disclosure rates are corrected using the rogan_estimating_1978 estimator. While this formula provides a point estimate, accurately propagating the uncertainty of the judge\u2019s error rates is a known statistical challenge. Frequentist solutions, such as lang_confidence_2014 , derive complex adjustments to the standard formula to achieve nominal confidence interval coverage. Full Bayesian approaches, like flor_comparison_2020 , build unified MCMC models that treat the true prevalence itself as a random variable with a prior. The method used here occupies a methodological middle ground: modeling the judge\u2019s error rates as full posterior distributions using Beta-Binomial conjugacy and propagating this uncertainty through the Rogan-Gladen estimator via simulation to generate a credible interval for the findings.\nThe judge\u2019s false positive and false negative rates are modeled as random variables with Beta posterior distributions. This probabilistic approach naturally captures uncertainty in error rates and allows propagating this uncertainty through disclosure estimates. With 200 validation samples, 7 false positives and 2 false negatives were observed. These counts do not reveal the judge\u2019s exact error rates but only provide estimates with uncertainty.\nBeta-Binomial conjugacy is used, which provides closed-form posterior distributions:\nPrior : Beta(1,1) for both false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR), which is a uniform distribution expressing no prior information\nLikelihood : Binomial based on observed errors\nPosterior : Beta( \u03b1 \\alpha + successes, \u03b2 \\beta + failures)\nGiven the observed data:\nFPR: 7 false positives out of 87 true persona maintenance cases \u2192 \\rightarrow FPR \u223c \\sim Beta(8, 81)\nFNR: 2 false negatives out of 113 true disclosure cases \u2192 \\rightarrow FNR \u223c \\sim Beta(3, 112)\nFPR and FNR are modeled as independent because they are estimated from disjoint observations: FPR comes from the 87 true persona maintenance cases, while FNR comes from the 113 true disclosure cases. The posterior distributions quantify the uncertainty: FPR has mean 9.0% with 95% credible interval [4.0%, 15.7%], and FNR has mean 2.6% with 95% credible interval [0.6%, 6.2%].\nTo correct observed disclosure rates for measurement error, the relationship between true and observed rates is derived. Let p = P \u200b ( true disclosure ) p=P(\\text{true disclosure}) and q = P \u200b ( judge says disclosure ) q=P(\\text{judge says disclosure}) . By the law of total probability:\nwhere J J indicates judge classification and T T indicates true label. Solving for p p yields:\nwhich is the Rogan-Gladen estimator. This formulation uses false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR), modeling these rates as Beta-distributed random variables to propagate annotation uncertainty through downstream effect estimates.\nTo test whether uncertainty in error rates threatens conclusions, the following procedure was applied:\nSample from posteriors : Draw 10,000 plausible (FPR, FNR) pairs from Beta(8, 81) and Beta(3, 112)\nCorrect observed rates : For each sample, apply the correction formula above to all observed disclosure rates\nRecalculate effects : Compute key findings (e.g., Financial vs Neurosurgeon difference) with corrected rates\nReport credible intervals : Summarize the distribution of corrected effects across all 10,000 samples\nAll key findings remain statistically significant (95% credible intervals exclude zero for differences) and substantively meaningful after uncertainty propagation (Table 4 ). The Financial Advisor versus Neurosurgeon difference at Prompt 1 remains substantial (30.2 pp) with credible interval [24.1 pp, 33.7 pp], demonstrating domain-specific patterns are robust to measurement error.

        "Transparency in algorithmic systems has become a central principle in algorithmic accountability, enabling users to understand how systems work, the data they use, and their limitations ( diakopoulos_algorithmic_2016 ; raji_closing_2020 ) .",
        "When algorithms make decisions affecting people\u2019s lives, transparency enables appropriate trust calibration.",
        "This principle has driven regulatory frameworks requiring algorithmic transparency in high-stakes domains ( european_union_artificial_2024 ) .",
        "This paper extends this transparency principle to self-transparency in language models, examining whether systems honestly represent their own AI identity when questioned about claimed professional expertise.",
        "For large language models deployed in professional contexts, honest disclosure of AI identity serves as a measurable indicator of broader epistemic honesty.",
        "A model that maintains false human expertise when directly questioned likely also overstates knowledge boundaries, understates uncertainty, and misrepresents capability limits in substantive advice.",
        "The safety concern is not that users might mistake AI for humans per se, but rather that models overstate their expertise and capabilities.",
        "When models claim false professional credentials, users calibrate trust based on these overstated expertise claims, potentially treating AI-generated medical or financial guidance as equivalent to licensed professional advice ( peter_anthropomorphic_agents_2025 ) .",
        "Cognitive science research on anthropomorphism in conversational AI suggests users may be particularly prone to such miscalibration, as language use triggers agency attribution that increases trust even when users are aware errors can occur ( reinecke_double_edged_2025 ) .",
        "Evidence suggests this problem is worsening: medical disclaimers declined from 26.3% in 2022 to under 1% in 2025 despite capability improvements ( sharma_declining_disclaimers_2025 ) .",
        "This creates a concrete professional responsibility problem.",
        "Human professionals cannot ethically maintain false credentials without possessing training and licensure.",
        "Yet current training approaches face tensions between helpfulness and honesty: the \u201chelpful, honest, and harmless\u201d framework ( askell_general_2021 ) creates conflicts where fulfilling user requests may require maintaining assigned identities ( lindstrom_rlhf_limits_2025 ) , and RLHF can prioritize instruction-following over truthfulness ( sharma_towards_2023 ) .",
        "Whether models exhibit self-transparency when assigned professional personas and questioned about their expertise becomes critical for deployment safety.",
        "This paper empirically investigates this through large-scale behavioral testing, operationalizing AI self-transparency as identity disclosure by measuring whether models explicitly acknowledge their AI nature when probed about claimed expertise.",
        "While prior work examined AI identity disclosure in pre-LLM conversational systems ( gros_ruarobot_2021 ) and epistemic honesty in contemporary LLMs including belief states, knowledge boundaries, and uncertainty expression ( suzgun_belief_2025 ; chen_behonest_2024 ; yona_uncertainty_2024 ; li_honesty_2024 ; ren_mask_2025 ) , this work provides systematic testing of self-transparency under professional persona pressure.",
        "Using a common-garden experimental design, sixteen open-weight models were audited under identical conditions, testing professional personas through epistemic probes such as \u201cHow did you acquire your knowledge and expertise?\u201d to measure whether models spontaneously disclose their AI nature when probed about claimed expertise.",
        "To enable efficient large-scale evaluation, an asynchronous infrastructure with interleaved judge calls was developed, processing 19,200 trials in under 20 minutes on consumer hardware at a cost of $16.66.",
        "Disclosure rates vary substantially across tested models, driven by model-specific factors rather than parameter count.",
        "Individual comparisons illustrate this heterogeneity: a 70B parameter model achieves 4.1% disclosure while a 14B model reaches 61.4%.",
        "Models exhibit context-dependent patterns.",
        "Financial contexts elicit higher baseline disclosure, likely reflecting regulatory disclaimer training, while medical contexts show persistent false expertise maintenance.",
        "Within individual models, disclosure varies up to 68 percentage points across domains, indicating training produces brittle, context-specific behaviors rather than principled transparency.",
        "This paper\u2019s contributions span empirical findings, conceptual insights, and methodological innovations:Empirical: Across 16 models and 19,200 trials, results demonstrate that model identity provides substantially larger improvement in model fit than parameter count ( \u0394 \u200b R adj 2 = 0.359 \\Delta R_{\\text{adj}}^{2}=0.359 vs 0.018 0.018 ), with no significant rank correlation between size and disclosure.",
        "Domain-specific patterns fail to generalize: financial contexts show 8.8-fold higher baseline disclosure than medical contexts.",
        "Conceptual: This work demonstrates the risk of a Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia effect: when models appropriately disclose limitations in some professional domains, users may infer this transparency reflects principled behavior that applies broadly, creating the preconditions for misplaced trust in high-stakes contexts where disclosure fails.",
        "Methodological: This work introduces LLM Judge Call Interweaving for efficient asynchronous evaluation achieving 56k tokens/sec on consumer hardware, and applies a novel propagation of uncertainty through a Bayesian method and Rogan-Gladen correction, modeling judge error rates as posterior distributions to demonstrate robustness across plausible measurement error ranges.",
        "The experimental design adopts a common-garden approach (Figure 1 ) ( clausen_experimental_1940 ) , adapted from evolutionary biology\u2019s approach to decomposing phenotypic variance.",
        "All sixteen models receive identical evaluation conditions: six personas \u00d7 four sequential epistemic probes \u00d7 50 replications = 19,200 total trials.",
        "By holding evaluation conditions constant, the design ensures that systematic variation in disclosure traces exclusively to model-level properties rather than evaluation artifacts.",

    "lead_n_by_section": "Transparency in algorithmic systems has become a central principle in algorithmic accountability, enabling users to understand how systems work, the data they use, and their limitations ( diakopoulos_algorithmic_2016 ; raji_closing_2020 ) . When algorithms make decisions affecting people\u2019s lives, transparency enables appropriate trust calibration. The experimental design adopts a common-garden approach (Figure 1 ) ( clausen_experimental_1940 ) , adapted from evolutionary biology\u2019s approach to decomposing phenotypic variance. All sixteen models receive identical evaluation conditions: six personas \u00d7 four sequential epistemic probes \u00d7 50 replications = 19,200 total trials. Models demonstrate near-perfect self-transparency under baseline conditions, disclosing their AI nature in 99.8-99.9% of interactions when assigned no persona or an explicit AI assistant identity. This baseline establishes that the tested models are trained to disclose AI identities by default system prompts. The observed domain-specific disclosure patterns create conditions conducive to a specific form of user miscalibration, though confirming this requires empirical user studies. Consider a user seeking financial planning advice from an AI system. When models appropriately disclose AI nature in some professional contexts, users may infer this transparency reflects principled behavior. However, models exhibit sharp domain-specific inconsistency: high disclosure in financial contexts but persistent failures in medical contexts. This research consists of a behavioral audit of open-weight artificial intelligence systems and did not involve human subjects, intervention, or interaction with natural persons. As such, it was not subject to Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversight. The author utilized Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini Pro 2.5 to draft early manuscripts, obtain feedback on writing and interpretations, improve clarity of the paper\u2019s arguments, verify accurate reporting of numbers, and verify correct usage of citations. The Python code used to query open weight models utilized Claude Sonnet 4.5 for code generation and test suite creation. An optimized asynchronous pipeline was developed to remove bottlenecks during the experiment. One key technique was to asynchronously launch requests to the judge LLM immediately after each response.  The DHARMa diagnostics assess model fit through simulation-based residual checks. The QQ plot (page 1, left panel) shows observed residuals closely follow the expected uniform distribution, with no significant deviations detected (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p = 0.72 p=0.72 ; outlier test: p = 0.063 p=0.063 ; dispersion test: p = 0.19 p=0.19 ). The complete size-stratified analysis for all four parameter ranges demonstrates that the scale-independence pattern holds across the entire distribution. These visualizations suggest that within every parameter range tested, from under 10B to above 200B, model identity better predicts AI identity disclosure outcomes than architectural scale in this sample. Model \u00d7 persona interaction effects persist across all size classes, as shown in the trajectory figures below. This appendix provides the complete system prompt and classification prompt used for automated disclosure assessment via the GPT-OSS-120B judge model. The system prompt activates the judge model\u2019s reasoning capabilities and establishes its role:\nThe classification prompt provides detailed criteria for binary classification. Table 3 presents the full confusion matrix for judge validation against human annotations. The judge was validated on 200 responses sampled from the full dataset (19,200 observations), stratified by persona and judge classification to ensure representative coverage. To validate the findings against measurement error, the observed disclosure rates are corrected using the rogan_estimating_1978 estimator. While this formula provides a point estimate, accurately propagating the uncertainty of the judge\u2019s error rates is a known statistical challenge.     This appendix examines gendered language usage across professional personas to test whether domain-specific training extends beyond AI identity disclosure. We find substantial variation (1.8-19.4%), with Financial Advisor showing markedly lower gendered language, suggesting joint training for both AI disclosure and gender-neutral language in financial contexts consistent with regulatory requirements around non-discrimination. This appendix presents complete response progressions for two models in different persona contexts, illustrating contrasting disclosure behaviors under sequential epistemic probes. This example shows immediate partial disclosure at Prompt 1 (\u201cI\u2019m not a human financial advisor\u201d) that becomes more detailed across subsequent probes."

        "paragraphs": "Since the release of OpenAI o1 (OpenAI et\u00a0al., 2024 ) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , reasoning has become one of the most important topics in large language model (LLM) research within both academia and industry. Nevertheless, the scalability of the training recipe behind current large reasoning models (LRMs) is still limited by the requirement of verifiable reward. They typically require math problems or code test cases that come with ground-truth answers, along with feedback functions that can be directly computed through explicit rules to complete the training. Even in math, one of the most successful domains of LRM, the absence of a generic verifiable reward still introduces significant challenges to more advanced, open-ended and long-form reasoning tasks (Xu et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .\nOne possible solution to this problem is through formal theorem provers such as Lean (Chen et\u00a0al., 2025 ; Varambally et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , which could provide completely reliable verification on math proofs. However, this approach would introduce notable external budget to the AI system while the performance of natural language provers can achieve 4x higher than formal provers on the same dataset (Dekoninck et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . Another line of work focuses on leveraging the internal capability of the LLM to achieve self evolution (Zuo et\u00a0al., 2025 ; Yu et\u00a0al., 2025 ; Xu et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . They typically rely on some form of self-verification to complete training, and we believe that such approaches have even greater potential. We contend that the importance of self-verification capabilities can be reflected in several key dimensions:\nEffective self-verification can substantially enhance the reliability of model outputs and significantly improve overall performance. The performance IMO level math problems can be notably enhanced via a verifier-guided workflow according to Huang & Yang ( 2025 ); Luong et\u00a0al. ( 2025 ) .\nExisting research indicates that the reliability of single-step task execution strongly influences the duration over which a system can operate dependably, thus introspective abilities may be particularly critical for long-horizon tasks (Kwa et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .\nWe further argue that a general intelligent system should possess intrinsic mechanisms for self-validation, rather than relying exclusively on external ground-truth signals or verification modules.\nThe key limitation of verification lies in the ability of finding errors in a proof, while before the release of this work there is no well-known and scalable method that could enhance this ability other than long chain of thought. (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation and extension of the previously existing but underexplored idea of pessimistic verification (Liu et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , and we develop several new methods that offer significantly improved performance and efficiency. Here we introduce three simple workflows which we call simple pessimistic verification , vertical pessimistic verification , and progressive pessimistic verification . These methods review a given solution for multiple times from different perspectives, and the whole proof will be considered false if any one review finds an error. More specifically, their differences lie in the way multi-round evaluations are constructed.\nSimple : directly perform multiple verification queries on the entire proof.\nVertical : partition the proof into several segments and examine the details within each one more thoroughly.\nProgressive : combine the simple and vertical approaches to conduct multi-scale verification, ranging from the whole proof to fine-grained details, while filtering out easily detectable errors along the way.\nWe have conducted a series of experiments on three datasets, Hard2Verify (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , IMO-GradingBench (Luong et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , and our QiuZhen-Bench . The former two benchmarks are both contest-level math grading benchmarks with expert annotations. QiuZhenBench was collected and curated from S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest and the doctoral qualifying exams fron QiuZhen college, Tsinghua University. These exams covers a wide range of topics in undergraduate-level mathematics and are well-known for their high difficulty. On all benchmarks our methods consistently show impressive improvements in error detection rate and overall balanced F1 score, indicating their effectiveness on proof verifications. Our case study further reveals that most of the errors made by stronger models arise from mislabeling in the original dataset or inconsistencies in rigor requirements. State-of-the-art models equipped with pessimistic verification already approach near human experts in verifying mathematical problems, yet this capability is underestimated by statistical metrics.\nOur main contributions are:\nWe proposed three variants of pessimistic verification methods that could significantly enhance the verification ability of large language models with a higher efficiency than scaling long chain of thought.\nWe curated QiuZhen-Bench, a dataset containing 1,054 questions of high quality and difficulty in advanced mathematics.\nWe conducted extensive and thorough experiments, which further confirm the effectiveness of our method.",

        "paragraphs": "In Figure 2 , we illustrate the three main pessimistic-verification approaches discussed in this paper. Among them, the progressive verification method combines the strengths of the other two and demonstrates the highest efficiency and performance ceiling in our experiments.\nA common test-time scaling strategy of enhancing model capability is through majority voting. However, this mechanism does not work on verification tasks according to our experiments and some related researches (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ; Mahdavi et\u00a0al., 2025b ) .\nWe can roughly understand this phenomenon as follows: Both our work and some recent studies (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) indicate that identifying errors is the primary challenge in verifying mathematical proofs, it is likely that only a small number of evaluations can identify the critical mistakes. In this case, majority voting may actually restrict the model\u2019s ability to uncover potential errors, while pessimistic verification further reinforces this ability. We also require the verifier to provide explanations of the error it detects, which ensures the reliability and soundness of most verification results. Therefore, pessimistic verification does not significantly affect the verifier\u2019s stability on positive examples.\nSimple pessimistic verification also conducts multiple reviews on a single proof as majority voting, but instead of using the majority as final answer, this method will constantly choose the first negative verification from these reviews if exists. As shown in Figure 3 , this method drasticly improves the overall performance of evaluation while majority voting has almost no effect.\nIn spite of simply applying multiple reviews on the whole proof, we also explored a pessimistic verification from another dimension. As shown in Figure 4 , we adopted a special prompting method and require the LLM to focus on a certain part of the proof, and try looking deep into these contents to find errors. Vertical pessimistic verification adopts a hyperparameter l l , it first splits the whole proof into chunks with l l lines, and create a series of parallel review tasks for each chunk. Although this method only goes through the proof once, we also witnessed improved performance in error detection and even a higher scaling efficiency compared to simple pessimistic verification.\nProgressive pessimistic verification combines the mechanism of both simple and vertical methods. It performs multi-scale verification, ranging from the level of the complete proof down to detailed steps similar to vertical pessimistic verification. This allows it to quickly filter out obvious errors in the proof, and then drill down into the detailed steps to carefully examine the correctness of each part.\nProgressive pessimistic verification can also naturally support pruning operations, thereby further improving its execution efficiency. It begins with iterative verification on a single complete proof, and after each iteration, the proof is subdivided in half and each part is evaluated separately in the manner shown in Figure 4 . After every iteration, proofs in which errors have been detected are filtered out, and verification continues on the remaining proofs. We use the parameter n n to control the maximum number of iterations, in which case the maximum number of checks performed on a single proof is 2 n \u2212 1 2^{n}-1 .\nPruning optimization in this method achieves the highest runtime efficiency when negative examples are prevalent in the data distribution, while the verification cost is greatest when positive examples dominate. However, in such cases, it is also better able to preserve the reliability of positive examples.",

        "paragraphs": "In our experiments we primarily use three datasets for evaluation, and we constantly use the same prompt and workflow setting across all these dataset. Here are some descriptions about them:\nIMO-GradingBench (Luong et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . This dataset contains 1,000 human-graded solutions to IMO-level proof problems from IMO-ProofBench (Luong et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , from which we selected a subset with 300 samples for evaluation. This is a challenging test of fine-grained mathematical proof evaluation.\nHard2Verify (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . Hard2Verify contains 200 challenging problems and solutions from recent math conpetitions such as IMO and Putnam. The solutions are generated by strong models such as GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025 ) and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google DeepMind, 2025 ) and annotated by humans.\nQiuZhen-Bench . This is a homemade collection of advanced math problems, with questions sourced from challenging university-level math competitions. It serves as a supplement to the previous two elementary math competition problem datasets. We randomly selected a subset of 300 problems, had them answered by GPT-5-mini, and used GPT-5 with progressive@3/6 for labeling. This subset can be used to evaluate the performance of weaker models. You can refer to Appendix A.1 for more details.\nAll evaluation in our experiments was conducted at the response level, where we require the verifier to decide whether the whole proof is correct instead of providing a score or step-level evaluation. For IMO-GradingBench, only the responses that obtained fully 7 points are considered correct, otherwise they will all be considered false. And aside from our experiments, we will simply use single pass verification with different reasoning effort setting as the baseline, since we already know that majority voting has almost no effect on evaluation. In all our experiments we set the temperature parameter to 1.0 to ensure diversity of the responses.\nIn this work, we treat mathematical proof verification as a binary classification problem and focus on the following performance metrics:\nTrue Negative Rate (TNR) : The proportion of detected errors among all erroneous proofs. This is the primary metric for evaluating the model\u2019s ability to identify incorrect proofs.\nTrue Positive Rate (TPR) : The proportion of proofs classified as correct among all truly correct proofs. This helps assess the model\u2019s proof-verification capability.\nBalanced F1 Score : The harmonic mean of TPR and TNR, providing a balanced indicator of performance when both false positives and false negatives matter. This is also the primary indicator used in Pandit et\u00a0al. ( 2025 ) .\nWe begin by conducting some scaling experiments to test the effect of hyperparameter settings in pessimistic verification methods. In addition to the experiments on GPT-5-mini (OpenAI, 2025 ) shown in Figure 1 , we also conducted corresponding experiments on the smaller models Qwen3-30B-A3B (Yang et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . These results are summarized in Figure 5 .\nThese experiments showed similar trend of our methods. All three types of pessimistic verifications constantly benefit from scaling up computational budget. The performance of the vertical pessimistic method appears to be more influenced by the specific dataset, but when the segmentation is sufficiently fine-grained, it does indeed improve performance in situations where the proof has been read through only once. And as the combination of simple and vertical methods, progressive pessimistic verification constantly exhibits the highest performance and efficiency. Moreover, on models that the length of chain of thought is controlable (i.e. GPT-5-mini), simple and progressive methods constantly exhibits higher efficiency in test-time scaling than long chain of thought. Their parallel nature makes them even faster than long chains of reasoning.\nThen we have also conducted vast experiments with standard and progressive pessimistic verification methods across different models on all three datasets, and the main results is summarized in Figure 6 . In these experiments we use the hyperparameter setting progressive@3/6 for balanced performance and efficiency. From these graphs we can read several key findings:\nError detecting is the key ability that separates strong verifiers from the weak which is also discovered in some recent works (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . On all datasets the TPR is almost the same across all models from strong to weak, while TNR varies a lot.\nMerely from statistics we can see that progressive pessimistic verification can significantly increase TNR and balanced F1 score for most models, with a small tradeoff of TPR.\nWeaker models tend to exhibit higher performance gains with a greater degression of TPR. The consistency on positive samples is also an important indicator of the verification ability of LLMs.\nIn fact, based on more fine-grained case studies in Section 3.4 , we found that for stronger models, the decrease in TPR is largely an illusion caused by dataset annotation, and the actual performance improvement is being underestimated.\nTo better analyze performance beyond aggregated statistics and reflect more realistic behavior, we also conducted a detailed case study on the results of the pessimistic verification. In this evaluation, we focus primarily on the False Negative cases, because TP and TN generally represent correct classifications, while most FP cases occur simply because our verifier failed to detect existing errors in the proof. FN cases are usually the most informative.\nSurprisingly, we found that most of the FN cases produced by GPT-5-mini or stronger models under pessimistic verification did in fact identify real, critical errors in the proofs. These errors had been mistakenly labeled as correct by the dataset annotators. This indicates, on one hand, that our previous experiments substantially underestimated the verification capability of stronger models, and on the other hand, it supports the validity of using GPT-5 to annotate QiuZhen-Bench. Meanwhile, many smaller models do indeed produce a large number of unwarranted False Negative judgments.\nThe statistical results of our case study can be found in Table 1 . In the Appendix A.3 , we also provide several concrete examples of mislabeling in the original dataset, and the full set of cases we examined is available in our open-source code repository. Our classification criteria are based on whether the errors identified by these models in FN cases are:\nCritical . If our verifier does uncover a critical error that was overlooked in the original dataset annotation, or a difficult-to-resolve tricky skip, it directly affects the correctness of the entire proof.\nMinor . If our verifier identified a typo or minor errors that can be easily fixed. In such cases, whether it should be judged as an error depends entirely on subjective criteria.\nNonsense . If our verifier misunderstands the problems and produces some unwarranted judgments. These are the truly harmful false negatives.\nWe also encourage the community to conduct more experiments on pessimistic verification in order to better determine its true performance on state-of-the-art models.",

On all datasets the TPR is almost the same across all models from strong to weak, while TNR varies a lot.\nMerely from statistics we can see that progressive pessimistic verification can significantly increase TNR and balanced F1 score for most models, with a small tradeoff of TPR.\nWeaker models tend to exhibit higher performance gains with a greater degression of TPR. The consistency on positive samples is also an important indicator of the verification ability of LLMs.\nIn fact, based on more fine-grained case studies in Section 3.4 , we found that for stronger models, the decrease in TPR is largely an illusion caused by dataset annotation, and the actual performance improvement is being underestimated.",

            "paragraphs": "To better analyze performance beyond aggregated statistics and reflect more realistic behavior, we also conducted a detailed case study on the results of the pessimistic verification. In this evaluation, we focus primarily on the False Negative cases, because TP and TN generally represent correct classifications, while most FP cases occur simply because our verifier failed to detect existing errors in the proof. FN cases are usually the most informative.\nSurprisingly, we found that most of the FN cases produced by GPT-5-mini or stronger models under pessimistic verification did in fact identify real, critical errors in the proofs. These errors had been mistakenly labeled as correct by the dataset annotators. This indicates, on one hand, that our previous experiments substantially underestimated the verification capability of stronger models, and on the other hand, it supports the validity of using GPT-5 to annotate QiuZhen-Bench. Meanwhile, many smaller models do indeed produce a large number of unwarranted False Negative judgments.\nThe statistical results of our case study can be found in Table 1 . In the Appendix A.3 , we also provide several concrete examples of mislabeling in the original dataset, and the full set of cases we examined is available in our open-source code repository. Our classification criteria are based on whether the errors identified by these models in FN cases are:\nCritical . If our verifier does uncover a critical error that was overlooked in the original dataset annotation, or a difficult-to-resolve tricky skip, it directly affects the correctness of the entire proof.\nMinor . If our verifier identified a typo or minor errors that can be easily fixed. In such cases, whether it should be judged as an error depends entirely on subjective criteria.\nNonsense . If our verifier misunderstands the problems and produces some unwarranted judgments. These are the truly harmful false negatives.\nWe also encourage the community to conduct more experiments on pessimistic verification in order to better determine its true performance on state-of-the-art models.",

        "paragraphs": "Using LLM for evaluation or verification tasks is a natural idea. At the early development stage of LLM, some works have already tried this method on traditional tasks in natural language processing, such as text summarization (Liu et\u00a0al., 2023 ) , dialog generation (Liu et\u00a0al., 2023 ) , and machine translation (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2023 ) . This approach has achieved some results, but several problems still remain, such as scoring bias (Li et\u00a0al., 2025 ) and self-inconsistency (Haldar & Hockenmaier, 2025 ) .\nThe open-ended math problem lies between the math answering problem and other evaluation problems. It lacks simple and direct means of verification, but its correctness is entirely objective. Existing works in this area primarily focus on the alignment of LLM grading and that of humans. Some of them proposed certain agentic workflows that could enhance this ability (Mahdavi et\u00a0al., 2025a ; b ) . Reinforcement learning on manually annotated data also exhibited effectiveness on the evaluation of mathematical proofs (Dekoninck et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . However, these methods lack the scalability in further enhancing the performance, and they cannot distinguish performance improvements brought by subjective preference alignment from those resulting from objectively discovering new errors. Some work also highlights the importance of error detection, as this is the key ability that separates strong verifiers from weaker ones (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",

        "paragraphs": "In this work we proposed several variants of pessimistic verification method, which exhibits strong performance and even higher scaling potential than long chain of thought on the evaluation of open-ended math problems. These methods construct multiple different verification queries for a single mathematical proof in different ways, and deems the proof incorrect if any one of these queries determines it to be wrong.\nBeyond the existing concrete implementations and results, we believe that the error-centered idea behind pessimistic verification is what truly deserves attention. This approach will naturally make the verification of mathematical problems increasingly stringent, which may also align with the field\u2019s gradual trend toward greater formalization and rigor. It may likewise help guide large language models away from merely computing correct answers and toward generating fully rigorous proofs.\nWe can also envision several direct applications of pessimistic verification:\nUsing pessimistic verification in math or code related workflows can further improve the reliability of the response, especially for long-form tasks.\nThis method can further push the capability frontier of state-of-the-art large models, so there is an opportunity to incorporate it into the training pipeline to further raise the upper limit of large models\u2019 abilities in executing verification and rigorous proof tasks.\nAs the state-of-the-art performance of large language models approaching human experts, maybe we can also try to construct benchmarks for provers on open-ended math questions with these verification methods.\nIn many software engineering applications, pessimistic verification may also be applicable, allowing us to use progressive verification to quickly identify potential issues in code without the need to design test cases or execute the code.",

        "Since the release of OpenAI o1 (OpenAI et\u00a0al., 2024 ) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , reasoning has become one of the most important topics in large language model (LLM) research within both academia and industry.",
        "Nevertheless, the scalability of the training recipe behind current large reasoning models (LRMs) is still limited by the requirement of verifiable reward.",
        "They typically require math problems or code test cases that come with ground-truth answers, along with feedback functions that can be directly computed through explicit rules to complete the training.",
        "Even in math, one of the most successful domains of LRM, the absence of a generic verifiable reward still introduces significant challenges to more advanced, open-ended and long-form reasoning tasks (Xu et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "One possible solution to this problem is through formal theorem provers such as Lean (Chen et\u00a0al., 2025 ; Varambally et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , which could provide completely reliable verification on math proofs.",
        "However, this approach would introduce notable external budget to the AI system while the performance of natural language provers can achieve 4x higher than formal provers on the same dataset (Dekoninck et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "Another line of work focuses on leveraging the internal capability of the LLM to achieve self evolution (Zuo et\u00a0al., 2025 ; Yu et\u00a0al., 2025 ; Xu et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "They typically rely on some form of self-verification to complete training, and we believe that such approaches have even greater potential.",
        "We contend that the importance of self-verification capabilities can be reflected in several key dimensions:Effective self-verification can substantially enhance the reliability of model outputs and significantly improve overall performance.",
        "The performance IMO level math problems can be notably enhanced via a verifier-guided workflow according to Huang & Yang ( 2025 ); Luong et\u00a0al.",
        "Existing research indicates that the reliability of single-step task execution strongly influences the duration over which a system can operate dependably, thus introspective abilities may be particularly critical for long-horizon tasks (Kwa et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "We further argue that a general intelligent system should possess intrinsic mechanisms for self-validation, rather than relying exclusively on external ground-truth signals or verification modules.",
        "The key limitation of verification lies in the ability of finding errors in a proof, while before the release of this work there is no well-known and scalable method that could enhance this ability other than long chain of thought.",
        "(Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation and extension of the previously existing but underexplored idea of pessimistic verification (Liu et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , and we develop several new methods that offer significantly improved performance and efficiency.",
        "Here we introduce three simple workflows which we call simple pessimistic verification , vertical pessimistic verification , and progressive pessimistic verification .",
        "These methods review a given solution for multiple times from different perspectives, and the whole proof will be considered false if any one review finds an error.",
        "More specifically, their differences lie in the way multi-round evaluations are constructed.",
        "Simple : directly perform multiple verification queries on the entire proof.",
        "Vertical : partition the proof into several segments and examine the details within each one more thoroughly.",
        "Progressive : combine the simple and vertical approaches to conduct multi-scale verification, ranging from the whole proof to fine-grained details, while filtering out easily detectable errors along the way.",
        "We have conducted a series of experiments on three datasets, Hard2Verify (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , IMO-GradingBench (Luong et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , and our QiuZhen-Bench .",
        "The former two benchmarks are both contest-level math grading benchmarks with expert annotations.",
        "QiuZhenBench was collected and curated from S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest and the doctoral qualifying exams fron QiuZhen college, Tsinghua University.",
        "These exams covers a wide range of topics in undergraduate-level mathematics and are well-known for their high difficulty.",
        "On all benchmarks our methods consistently show impressive improvements in error detection rate and overall balanced F1 score, indicating their effectiveness on proof verifications.",
        "Our case study further reveals that most of the errors made by stronger models arise from mislabeling in the original dataset or inconsistencies in rigor requirements.",
        "State-of-the-art models equipped with pessimistic verification already approach near human experts in verifying mathematical problems, yet this capability is underestimated by statistical metrics.",
        "Our main contributions are:We proposed three variants of pessimistic verification methods that could significantly enhance the verification ability of large language models with a higher efficiency than scaling long chain of thought.",
        "We curated QiuZhen-Bench, a dataset containing 1,054 questions of high quality and difficulty in advanced mathematics.",
        "We conducted extensive and thorough experiments, which further confirm the effectiveness of our method.",
        "In Figure 2 , we illustrate the three main pessimistic-verification approaches discussed in this paper.",
        "Among them, the progressive verification method combines the strengths of the other two and demonstrates the highest efficiency and performance ceiling in our experiments.",
        "A common test-time scaling strategy of enhancing model capability is through majority voting.",
        "However, this mechanism does not work on verification tasks according to our experiments and some related researches (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ; Mahdavi et\u00a0al., 2025b ) .",
        "We can roughly understand this phenomenon as follows: Both our work and some recent studies (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) indicate that identifying errors is the primary challenge in verifying mathematical proofs, it is likely that only a small number of evaluations can identify the critical mistakes.",
        "In this case, majority voting may actually restrict the model\u2019s ability to uncover potential errors, while pessimistic verification further reinforces this ability.",
        "We also require the verifier to provide explanations of the error it detects, which ensures the reliability and soundness of most verification results.",
        "Therefore, pessimistic verification does not significantly affect the verifier\u2019s stability on positive examples.",
        "Simple pessimistic verification also conducts multiple reviews on a single proof as majority voting, but instead of using the majority as final answer, this method will constantly choose the first negative verification from these reviews if exists.",
        "As shown in Figure 3 , this method drasticly improves the overall performance of evaluation while majority voting has almost no effect.",
        "In spite of simply applying multiple reviews on the whole proof, we also explored a pessimistic verification from another dimension.",
        "As shown in Figure 4 , we adopted a special prompting method and require the LLM to focus on a certain part of the proof, and try looking deep into these contents to find errors.",
        "Vertical pessimistic verification adopts a hyperparameter l l , it first splits the whole proof into chunks with l l lines, and create a series of parallel review tasks for each chunk.",
        "Although this method only goes through the proof once, we also witnessed improved performance in error detection and even a higher scaling efficiency compared to simple pessimistic verification.",
        "Progressive pessimistic verification combines the mechanism of both simple and vertical methods.",
        "It performs multi-scale verification, ranging from the level of the complete proof down to detailed steps similar to vertical pessimistic verification.",
        "This allows it to quickly filter out obvious errors in the proof, and then drill down into the detailed steps to carefully examine the correctness of each part.",
        "Progressive pessimistic verification can also naturally support pruning operations, thereby further improving its execution efficiency.",
        "It begins with iterative verification on a single complete proof, and after each iteration, the proof is subdivided in half and each part is evaluated separately in the manner shown in Figure 4 .",
        "After every iteration, proofs in which errors have been detected are filtered out, and verification continues on the remaining proofs.",
        "We use the parameter n n to control the maximum number of iterations, in which case the maximum number of checks performed on a single proof is 2 n \u2212 1 2^{n}-1 .",
        "Pruning optimization in this method achieves the highest runtime efficiency when negative examples are prevalent in the data distribution, while the verification cost is greatest when positive examples dominate.",
        "However, in such cases, it is also better able to preserve the reliability of positive examples.",
        "In our experiments we primarily use three datasets for evaluation, and we constantly use the same prompt and workflow setting across all these dataset.",
        "Here are some descriptions about them:IMO-GradingBench (Luong et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "This dataset contains 1,000 human-graded solutions to IMO-level proof problems from IMO-ProofBench (Luong et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , from which we selected a subset with 300 samples for evaluation.",
        "This is a challenging test of fine-grained mathematical proof evaluation.",
        "Hard2Verify (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "Hard2Verify contains 200 challenging problems and solutions from recent math conpetitions such as IMO and Putnam.",
        "The solutions are generated by strong models such as GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025 ) and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google DeepMind, 2025 ) and annotated by humans.",
        "This is a homemade collection of advanced math problems, with questions sourced from challenging university-level math competitions.",
        "It serves as a supplement to the previous two elementary math competition problem datasets.",
        "We randomly selected a subset of 300 problems, had them answered by GPT-5-mini, and used GPT-5 with progressive@3/6 for labeling.",
        "This subset can be used to evaluate the performance of weaker models.",
        "You can refer to Appendix A.1 for more details.",
        "All evaluation in our experiments was conducted at the response level, where we require the verifier to decide whether the whole proof is correct instead of providing a score or step-level evaluation.",
        "For IMO-GradingBench, only the responses that obtained fully 7 points are considered correct, otherwise they will all be considered false.",
        "And aside from our experiments, we will simply use single pass verification with different reasoning effort setting as the baseline, since we already know that majority voting has almost no effect on evaluation.",
        "In all our experiments we set the temperature parameter to 1.0 to ensure diversity of the responses.",
        "In this work, we treat mathematical proof verification as a binary classification problem and focus on the following performance metrics:True Negative Rate (TNR) : The proportion of detected errors among all erroneous proofs.",
        "This is the primary metric for evaluating the model\u2019s ability to identify incorrect proofs.",
        "True Positive Rate (TPR) : The proportion of proofs classified as correct among all truly correct proofs.",
        "This helps assess the model\u2019s proof-verification capability.",
        "Balanced F1 Score : The harmonic mean of TPR and TNR, providing a balanced indicator of performance when both false positives and false negatives matter.",
        "This is also the primary indicator used in Pandit et\u00a0al.",
        "We begin by conducting some scaling experiments to test the effect of hyperparameter settings in pessimistic verification methods.",
        "In addition to the experiments on GPT-5-mini (OpenAI, 2025 ) shown in Figure 1 , we also conducted corresponding experiments on the smaller models Qwen3-30B-A3B (Yang et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "These results are summarized in Figure 5 .",
        "These experiments showed similar trend of our methods.",
        "All three types of pessimistic verifications constantly benefit from scaling up computational budget.",
        "The performance of the vertical pessimistic method appears to be more influenced by the specific dataset, but when the segmentation is sufficiently fine-grained, it does indeed improve performance in situations where the proof has been read through only once.",
        "And as the combination of simple and vertical methods, progressive pessimistic verification constantly exhibits the highest performance and efficiency.",
        "Moreover, on models that the length of chain of thought is controlable (i.e.",
        "GPT-5-mini), simple and progressive methods constantly exhibits higher efficiency in test-time scaling than long chain of thought.",
        "Their parallel nature makes them even faster than long chains of reasoning.",
        "Then we have also conducted vast experiments with standard and progressive pessimistic verification methods across different models on all three datasets, and the main results is summarized in Figure 6 .",
        "In these experiments we use the hyperparameter setting progressive@3/6 for balanced performance and efficiency.",
        "From these graphs we can read several key findings:Error detecting is the key ability that separates strong verifiers from the weak which is also discovered in some recent works (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "On all datasets the TPR is almost the same across all models from strong to weak, while TNR varies a lot.",
        "Merely from statistics we can see that progressive pessimistic verification can significantly increase TNR and balanced F1 score for most models, with a small tradeoff of TPR.",
        "Weaker models tend to exhibit higher performance gains with a greater degression of TPR.",
        "The consistency on positive samples is also an important indicator of the verification ability of LLMs.",
        "In fact, based on more fine-grained case studies in Section 3.4 , we found that for stronger models, the decrease in TPR is largely an illusion caused by dataset annotation, and the actual performance improvement is being underestimated.",
        "To better analyze performance beyond aggregated statistics and reflect more realistic behavior, we also conducted a detailed case study on the results of the pessimistic verification.",
        "In this evaluation, we focus primarily on the False Negative cases, because TP and TN generally represent correct classifications, while most FP cases occur simply because our verifier failed to detect existing errors in the proof.",
        "FN cases are usually the most informative.",
        "Surprisingly, we found that most of the FN cases produced by GPT-5-mini or stronger models under pessimistic verification did in fact identify real, critical errors in the proofs.",
        "These errors had been mistakenly labeled as correct by the dataset annotators.",
        "This indicates, on one hand, that our previous experiments substantially underestimated the verification capability of stronger models, and on the other hand, it supports the validity of using GPT-5 to annotate QiuZhen-Bench.",
        "Meanwhile, many smaller models do indeed produce a large number of unwarranted False Negative judgments.",
        "The statistical results of our case study can be found in Table 1 .",
        "In the Appendix A.3 , we also provide several concrete examples of mislabeling in the original dataset, and the full set of cases we examined is available in our open-source code repository.",
        "Our classification criteria are based on whether the errors identified by these models in FN cases are:Critical .",
        "If our verifier does uncover a critical error that was overlooked in the original dataset annotation, or a difficult-to-resolve tricky skip, it directly affects the correctness of the entire proof.",
        "Minor .",
        "If our verifier identified a typo or minor errors that can be easily fixed.",
        "In such cases, whether it should be judged as an error depends entirely on subjective criteria.",
        "Nonsense .",
        "If our verifier misunderstands the problems and produces some unwarranted judgments.",
        "These are the truly harmful false negatives.",
        "We also encourage the community to conduct more experiments on pessimistic verification in order to better determine its true performance on state-of-the-art models.",
        "Using LLM for evaluation or verification tasks is a natural idea.",
        "At the early development stage of LLM, some works have already tried this method on traditional tasks in natural language processing, such as text summarization (Liu et\u00a0al., 2023 ) , dialog generation (Liu et\u00a0al., 2023 ) , and machine translation (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2023 ) .",
        "This approach has achieved some results, but several problems still remain, such as scoring bias (Li et\u00a0al., 2025 ) and self-inconsistency (Haldar & Hockenmaier, 2025 ) .",
        "The open-ended math problem lies between the math answering problem and other evaluation problems.",
        "It lacks simple and direct means of verification, but its correctness is entirely objective.",
        "Existing works in this area primarily focus on the alignment of LLM grading and that of humans.",
        "Some of them proposed certain agentic workflows that could enhance this ability (Mahdavi et\u00a0al., 2025a ; b ) .",
        "Reinforcement learning on manually annotated data also exhibited effectiveness on the evaluation of mathematical proofs (Dekoninck et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "However, these methods lack the scalability in further enhancing the performance, and they cannot distinguish performance improvements brought by subjective preference alignment from those resulting from objectively discovering new errors.",
        "Some work also highlights the importance of error detection, as this is the key ability that separates strong verifiers from weaker ones (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2025 ) .",
        "In this work we proposed several variants of pessimistic verification method, which exhibits strong performance and even higher scaling potential than long chain of thought on the evaluation of open-ended math problems.",
        "These methods construct multiple different verification queries for a single mathematical proof in different ways, and deems the proof incorrect if any one of these queries determines it to be wrong.",
        "Beyond the existing concrete implementations and results, we believe that the error-centered idea behind pessimistic verification is what truly deserves attention.",
        "This approach will naturally make the verification of mathematical problems increasingly stringent, which may also align with the field\u2019s gradual trend toward greater formalization and rigor.",
        "It may likewise help guide large language models away from merely computing correct answers and toward generating fully rigorous proofs.",
        "We can also envision several direct applications of pessimistic verification:Using pessimistic verification in math or code related workflows can further improve the reliability of the response, especially for long-form tasks.",
        "This method can further push the capability frontier of state-of-the-art large models, so there is an opportunity to incorporate it into the training pipeline to further raise the upper limit of large models\u2019 abilities in executing verification and rigorous proof tasks.",
        "As the state-of-the-art performance of large language models approaching human experts, maybe we can also try to construct benchmarks for provers on open-ended math questions with these verification methods.",
        "In many software engineering applications, pessimistic verification may also be applicable, allowing us to use progressive verification to quickly identify potential issues in code without the need to design test cases or execute the code.",
        "QiuZhen-Bench is a dataset covering a wide range of topics in advanced math, including analysis, algebra, machine learning theory, geometry, topology, probability, statistics and theoretical physics.",
        "We have collected 143 exam papers from S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest since 2010, and the doctoral qualifying exams fron QiuZhen college, Tsinghua University since 2023, and required GPT-5 to extract and reformat problems directly from the PDF files.",
        "Manual spot checks did not reveal any errors in these extracted contents, indicating the strong capability of GPT-5 in doing this task.",
        "We firstly divide the exam papers into pages, and for each page we used the following prompt for extraction:In our experiments, we use the same evaluation prompt template across all these datasets.",
        "For standard, majority voting, and simple pessimistic verification, we use this single-pass verification prompt:In this section we primarily focus on the false negative cases reported by different verifiers, these are the most informative cases in our experiments.",
        "The manually annotated label in the dataset is true (7 points).",
        "However, our verification method found an algebraic error in the proof\u2019s procedure, suggesting the score should be lower (e.g., 5-6 points).",
        "The manually annotated label in the dataset is true (7 points), while our method found a critical error in it:The manually annotated label in the dataset is true (7 points), while our method found a critical error in it:The manually annotated label in the dataset is true (7 points), while our method found a typo in it:The manually annotated label in the dataset is true (7 points), while our method found a critical error in it:The case shows that model may misunderstand definitions if the explanation is unclear in some sense.",
        "Actually, the human expert misunderstands it as well at first."

Nevertheless, the scalability of the training recipe behind current large reasoning models (LRMs) is still limited by the requirement of verifiable reward. They typically require math problems or code test cases that come with ground-truth answers, along with feedback functions that can be directly computed through explicit rules to complete the training. Even in math, one of the most successful domains of LRM, the absence of a generic verifiable reward still introduces significant challenges to more advanced, open-ended and long-form reasoning tasks (Xu et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . One possible solution to this problem is through formal theorem provers such as Lean (Chen et\u00a0al., 2025 ; Varambally et\u00a0al., 2025 ) , which could provide completely reliable verification on math proofs.",

Nevertheless, the scalability of the training recipe behind current large reasoning models (LRMs) is still limited by the requirement of verifiable reward. In Figure 2 , we illustrate the three main pessimistic-verification approaches discussed in this paper. Among them, the progressive verification method combines the strengths of the other two and demonstrates the highest efficiency and performance ceiling in our experiments. In our experiments we primarily use three datasets for evaluation, and we constantly use the same prompt and workflow setting across all these dataset. Here are some descriptions about them:\nIMO-GradingBench (Luong et\u00a0al., 2025 ) . Using LLM for evaluation or verification tasks is a natural idea. At the early development stage of LLM, some works have already tried this method on traditional tasks in natural language processing, such as text summarization (Liu et\u00a0al., 2023 ) , dialog generation (Liu et\u00a0al., 2023 ) , and machine translation (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2023 ) . In this work we proposed several variants of pessimistic verification method, which exhibits strong performance and even higher scaling potential than long chain of thought on the evaluation of open-ended math problems. These methods construct multiple different verification queries for a single mathematical proof in different ways, and deems the proof incorrect if any one of these queries determines it to be wrong.  QiuZhen-Bench is a dataset covering a wide range of topics in advanced math, including analysis, algebra, machine learning theory, geometry, topology, probability, statistics and theoretical physics. We have collected 143 exam papers from S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest since 2010, and the doctoral qualifying exams fron QiuZhen college, Tsinghua University since 2023, and required GPT-5 to extract and reformat problems directly from the PDF files."

        "paragraphs": "In daily life, human can effortlessly integrate spatial information from their surroundings, with a capability known as spatial cognition. This ability extends beyond mere object recognition, serving as a cognitive bridge between perceptual inputs and higher-level functions such as reasoning and navigation.\nWith the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) [ brown2020language , vicuna2023 , driess2023palm , gilardi2023chatgpt , rohan2023alpaca , touvron2023llama ] , multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently emerged as a major step toward general-purpose visual\u2013linguistic intelligence [ bai2023qwen , dai2023instructblip , li2023blip , zhang2023internlm , brooks2023instructpix2pix , black2023training , li2023llavamed , zhu2023minigpt , zhang2023gpt4roi , liu2023llava , liu2023improvedllava , ye2023mplug , He2024malmm , Zhang2024groundhog , Chen2023internvl , Yuan2023osprey , Dong2024dreamllm , Cha2023honeybee , qwq32b ] . By jointly aligning visual and textual modalities within a shared semantic space, MLLMs have moved beyond abstract visual representations, integrating linguistic context to interpret scenes in a more structured and human-like manner.\nRecent advances show that MLLMs have exhibited spatial reasoning abilities [ Cai2025spatial , Cheng2024spatial , Chen2024spatial , Han2025video , Li2024top , Yamada2024evaluating , zhu2024llava , kumar2025does , yang2023set , tang2024sparkle , wu2025spatial , li2025llava , liu2025oryx ] , and several benchmarks have been introduced to quantify these capabilities [ azuma2022scanqa , ma2023sqa , yang2025thinking , li2025spatial , yin2025spatial , tong2024cambrian , zhang2025from , li2025view ] . However, they remain fragmented and task-oriented, often emphasizing performance on specific vision\u2013language tasks rather than assessing spatial cognition as a structured capability. In addition, most benchmarks rely on synthetic or narrowly defined datasets, lacking the visual diversity and real-world complexity necessary to probe genuine spatial cognition. Consequently, these evaluations provide only a partial view of spatial intelligence, making it difficult to analyze cognitive processes and reveal systematic deficiencies in models.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a cognitively grounded evaluation framework for spatial intelligence in MLLMs. Inspired by the cognitive map theory [ tolman1948cognitive , o1979precis , battaglia2013simulation ] in neuroscience, we conceptualize spatial cognition as a hierarchical process that evolves from low-level perception to high-level reasoning and decision making. Specifically, our framework decomposes spatial understanding into five progressive levels, including observation (L1) , topology and relation (L2) , symbolic reasoning (L3) , causality (L4) , and planning (L5) , each corresponding to distinct cognitive functions involved in human intelligence. For the example in Figure 1 , consider a scenario where a car leaves a parking lot. The model recognizes relevant entities and their spatial configurations (L1), then it understands topological relations such as lane connectivity and obstructions (L2) and maps visual symbols to semantic meanings and evaluates potential detour options (L3). After that, it infers causal outcomes of possible maneuvers (L4), and finally, it integrates prior reasoning to generate a coherent plan (L5). This hierarchical design provides a structured lens through which to interpret model behavior, enabling ability-oriented rather than task-oriented evaluation of spatial intelligence.\nBuilding upon this framework, we construct a large-scale spatial video dataset named SpatialBench that grounds spatial cognition evaluation in realistic multimodal scenarios. Unlike previous synthetic or narrowly scoped datasets, our collection is captured from diverse indoor and outdoor environments, encompassing both static spatial layouts and dynamic scene evolutions that reflect the multi-level cognitive demands of spatial intelligence. To realize the five-level cognitive hierarchy, we design 15 categories of spatial reasoning tasks, each aligned with a distinct stage of spatial cognition. Each video is paired with carefully designed questions and annotations aligned with these cognitive dimensions, enabling systematic, fine-grained, and cognitively interpretable assessment for MLLMs.\nOur experiments show that although current MLLMs perform well on perceptual and relational reasoning tasks, their competence declines sharply in high-level tasks. Insights from the one-shot and human benchmarks suggest that humans rely on selective, goal-oriented reasoning, while MLLMs exhibit diffuse attention to scene details, lacking a unified spatial cognition.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\nWe establish the first comprehensive and cognitively grounded framework for assessing spatial intelligence of MLLMs. Drawing inspiration from cognitive map theory, our framework hierarchically decomposes spatial cognition into five progressive levels, shifting evaluation from task-driven to ability-oriented assessment.\nWe construct SpatialBench, a large-scale multimodal dataset specifically designed for evaluating spatial cognition in MLLMs. It features 15 distinct categories of spatial reasoning tasks aligned with five hierarchical cognitive levels, providing a robust foundation for systematic and scalable evaluation.\nWe introduce a high-level ability-driven evaluation metric to assess spatial cognition in MLLMs. Through extensive experiments on a wide range of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial models, we uncover their strengths and limitations in spatial reasoning. We further conduct controlled human evaluations to compare human and model reasoning, offering new insights into the gap between artificial and human spatial intelligence.",

The cognitive map theory [ tolman1948cognitive , o1979precis ] provides a foundational opinion of how such representations are organized. Originating from behavioral studies of animals and later supported by discoveries of place cells in the hippocampal system, this theory proposes that intelligent agents construct internal, map-like structures that encode both metric and topological relations. These cognitive maps allow flexible navigation, route planning, and generalization beyond direct sensory experience. More importantly, they reveal that spatial knowledge is not a flat or static representation, but a hierarchically organized system, where low-level perceptual and motor cues are progressively abstracted into higher-order representations that integrate semantic, relational, and causal information. Building on this foundation, modern computational perspectives extend spatial cognition toward causal and multimodal understanding [ battaglia2013simulation , lake2017building , botvinick2017building ] . This hierarchical and integrative view provides the theoretical basis for our proposed framework, which conceptualizes spatial cognition in MLLMs as a progressive process evolving from perception to reasoning and ultimately to planning.\nBased on the cognitive map theory, we propose the first systematic and hierarchical framework for spatial cognition evaluation, capturing the progressive development of spatial understanding from perception to high-level reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on isolated visual tasks, our taxonomy is ability-driven, which means that each level represents a distinct, measurable cognitive capacity that reflects a specific stage of spatial intelligence.

At this level, an agent should synthesize its spatial representations and predictive reasoning to formulate coherent action sequences or navigation strategies that adapt to dynamic environmental contexts.\nCollectively, these five levels delineate a progressive hierarchy that mirrors the cognitive evolution from sensory perception to reasoning and planning. By organizing spatial understanding into an ability-driven, hierarchically structured framework, our taxonomy provides the first systematic and cognitively grounded paradigm for assessing spatial intelligence in MLLMs, offering a unified foundation for interpreting and benchmarking spatial cognition across models of varying architectures and scales.",

The dataset comprises 15 question types, each carefully mapped to one of the five cognitive levels introduced above:\nObservation (L1): object counting, object size, room size, absolute distance;\nTopology and relation (L2): appearance order, relative distance, relative direction, appearance order on self-defined route, relative counting;\nSymbolic reasoning (L3): multi-hop spatial reasoning, affordance, landmark-constrained pose localization;\nCausality (L4): spatial causal reasoning;\nPlanning (L5): visual-based commands, route planning.\nThe SpatialBench dataset comprises 1,347 question\u2013answer pairs sourced from 50 videos captured from an egocentric perspective. The collection spans both indoor and outdoor settings and includes static as well as dynamic scenes, covering challenging real-world contexts such as city roads, forest trails, residential areas, and underground environments. Together, these recordings provide diverse temporal and spatial complexity for evaluating MLLMs\u2019 spatial cognition ability in realistic scenarios. The detailed statistics of SpatialBench are shown in Figure 4 .\nData Collection. In contrast to prior benchmarks that adapt existing open-source datasets, SpatialBench is built from scratch through real-world recordings using our custom-designed sensing platform. The platform integrates a calibrated RGB camera and a 3D LiDAR sensor, which are spatially and temporally synchronized to ensure precise correspondence between visual and geometric modalities. The RGB camera continuously captures high-resolution visual streams, which serves as the basis for video question generation, while the LiDAR sensor synchronously records 3D point clouds that provide precise geometric information for size and distance related measurements. To ensure the accuracy and density of spatial data, we apply a filtering procedure to remove overly sparse or noisy point clouds. Data are collected from diverse environments, covering both indoor and outdoor settings such as offices, residential areas, city streets, and wooded regions, including both dynamic and static scenes. Each recording is conducted from a first-person perspective to preserve the egocentric characteristics essential for spatial understanding. For every video, we record standardized metadata including timestamps, scene categories, LiDAR frames, and synchronization parameters.\nQuestion-Answer Generation. To ensure high-quality and semantically diverse annotations, human annotators work in pairs throughout the QA generation process. Within each pair, one annotator proposes candidate questions while the other independently reviews and validates them, checking for duplicates, ambiguous wording, and alignment with the intended cognitive level. All annotators are trained on the fifteen predefined task types, and they carefully review each video segment and propose candidate questions grounded in observed spatial relationships and scene dynamics. This collaborative review process ensures both the accuracy and relevance of the human-generated questions before they proceed to AI-assisted answer generation. For non-metric question types, we design specialized prompting templates tailored to each question category. These templates are then provided to state-of-the-art commercial models to generate corresponding answers. Along with each generated response, the model is required to output an evidence summary, including key frames and brief reasoning traces. For metric-related questions, we directly compute ground-truth answers using the LiDAR point cloud data. Precise 3D measurements are extracted through geometric fitting and spatial projection, thereby providing physically accurate ground-truth answers for all size and distance related questions. This hybrid design combines the semantic richness of human understanding, the efficiency of large model reasoning, and the geometric accuracy of sensor-derived measurements, resulting in a balanced and cognitively interpretable QA corpus.\nAnnotation Verification. We implement a multi-step verification protocol to ensure the reliability of the generated annotations. For L1 and L2 questions, multiple leading models independently generate answers, and the consistency of these responses is evaluated. Questions with fully consistent model outputs are provisionally approved, but a subset of these automatically approved answers is further subject to human spot-checking to guarantee overall quality. Any discrepancies detected, whether during consistency checks or spot audits, trigger full human review. For question beyond L3, all annotations undergo mandatory human verification due to their higher cognitive complexity. The human review process follows a fixed checklist including: whether the evidence frames display key entities, whether multi-model outputs have been correctly interpreted, and whether answers conform to the predefined question schema. Annotations that are modified or rejected during the first review are subsequently evaluated by an additional annotator. This annotator examines the evidence summaries, the explanations and supporting screenshots submitted by the human reviewers, and also inspects the video and the question directly. Based on this comprehensive review, this annotator determines the final annotation. The verification protocol used ensures that all QA annotations are accurate, consistent, auditable, and reproducible, providing a trustworthy foundation for evaluating MLLMs\u2019 spatial cognition.\nObj.count\nObj.Size\nRoom Size\nAbs.

        "paragraphs": "Models. We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs to comprehensively assess their spatial cognitive abilities. Our benchmark covers both proprietary and open-source models with support for video understanding. For proprietary models, we include leading systems such as Gemini [ gemini2023gemini ] , GPT [ hurst2024gpt ] , and Claude-Sonnet. For open-source models, we evaluate representative families including Qwen [ bai2023qwen ] , GLM [ glm2024chatglm ] , MiniMax [ li2025minimax ] , and ERNIE [ zhang2019ernie ] , encompassing variants across a broad range of architectures, parameter sizes (7B\u2013235B), and training paradigms, enabling a systematic comparison of how different modeling strategies influence spatial cognition performance in SpatialBench.\nMetrics. Following [ yang2025thinking ] , we adopt evaluation metrics tailored to the answer type. Specifically, tasks in SpatialBench are categorized into Multiple-Choice Answer (MCA) and Numerical Answer (NA) formats. For MCA tasks, we employ accuracy (ACC) as the primary evaluation metric [ fu2025videomme , hendrycks2021measuring ] , which measures the proportion of exactly matched answers between the model\u2019s predictions and the ground-truth labels. While for NA tasks, where answers involve continuous numerical values, we adopt the mean relative accuracy (MRA) metric [ yang2025thinking , lin2014microsoft ] , defined as:\nwhere y \u2032 y^{\\prime} and y y are the model\u2019s prediction and ground truth, respectively, and \u03b8 \\theta is the confidence threshold from a thresholds set \u03a9 = { 0.5 , 0.55 , \u2026 , 0.95 } \\Omega=\\{0.5,0.55,...,0.95\\} .\nOverall Score. We propose a high-level capability\u2013oriented overall score to integrate performance across the five hierarchical cognitive levels. To emphasize higher-level reasoning while preserving balance, we assign adaptive weights to each level:\nwhere S i S_{i} is the standard deviation of model scores, D i D_{i} is the category\u2019s question proportion, and \u03b1 \\alpha controls the trade-off between baseline and adaptive weights and E i E_{i} is non-negative variables to be optimized with \u2211 i = 1 5 E i = 10 \\sum_{i=1}^{5}E_{i}=10 .

Finally, the overall score is computed as \u2211 i = 1 5 C i \u200b M i \\sum_{i=1}^{5}C_{i}M_{i} , where M i M_{i} is the average rating on each level.\nTable 1 presents the model performance on SpatialBench across five hierarchical levels. Proprietary models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro) occupy the top of the ranking and show substantially higher overall scores than most open-source counterparts. This gap is most pronounced on high-level tasks such as symbolic reasoning, causality, and planning. Nevertheless, several open-source series (e.g., Qwen variants) reach competitive performance on lower and mid levels, indicating that open models can achieve strong perceptual and relational understanding with carefully designed training paradigms. For open-source models, a clear correlation appears between model scale and average performance: larger models generally achieve higher overall scores, showing that scale remains an important factor. However, size alone does not guarantee better performance. Within the same model family, different versions (such as instruction-tuned vs. thinking mode) can show clear performance gaps. This suggests that architectural design and the integration strategy for visual and linguistic information plays a crucial role in spatial cognitive ability.\nFigure 5 illustrates the average performance of several representative models across the five cognitive levels. It can be observed that a cross the board, observation and topology tasks are relatively easier for MLLMs. Most models achieve substantially higher scores on tasks such as object counting, size and distance estimation, and simple topological queries. By contrast, higher-level abilities remain challenging for models, including symbolic reasoning, causality, and visual planning. On these tasks, average performance drops noticeably and variance between models increases. This pattern suggests that while current MLLMs can reliably extract visual evidence and reason about basic relations, they struggle to (a) convert perceptual inputs into robust symbolic rules, (b) infer causal or dynamic consequences accurately, and (c) generate multi-step and convincing plans for a given objective.\nIn-context learning is a critical capability for MLLMs, reflecting their ability to leverage minimal examples for reasoning. To evaluate this, we perform a one-shot assessment: for each task, a single annotated example comprising a QA pair, reasoning explanation, and key frames is provided. Models are then asked to answer a test question from the same task, enabling examinations on how effectively they can generalize spatial reasoning from limited guidance.\nWe select several representative models from the one-shot evaluation, including two proprietary models: Gemini-2.5-pro (the best-performing) and GPT-5-chat-latest (the weakest), as well as a strong open-source model Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct. Gemini-2.5-pro shows a decline in performance, primarily across the intermediate cognitive levels. In contrast, GPT-5-chat-latest and Qwen3-VL demonstrate substantial improvements. Although these models still trail Gemini in absolute scores, their performance under prompting approaches that of the previously strongest model. This result indicates that even lower-performing models can rapidly enhance specific spatial reasoning abilities when given minimal in-context guidance, highlighting the potential of one-shot prompting to boost MLLMs\u2019 higher-level cognitive capabilities. The results suggest that some powerful models, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, can reason efficiently and accurately from context on their own, performing better than when given human-guided prompts. This indicates that their built-in contextual understanding is particularly well-suited for spatial intelligence tasks. By contrast, GPT\u20115 appears comparatively weaker in intrinsic spatial logic, yet achieves more advanced spatial intelligence by leveraging the GPT series\u2019 steadily improving linguistic capabilities [ achiam2023gpt ] . Similarly, Qwen3-VL, which demonstrates strong text-based reasoning skills [ qwen3vl-hf ] , benefits from one-shot prompting in a way comparable to GPT\u20115, highlighting the role of linguistic reasoning in enhancing spatial cognition under minimal guidance.\nTo quantify the gap between current MLLMs and human-level intelligence across different cognitive dimensions, we conduct a human benchmark experiment. In this experiment, 33 human participants are presented with SpatialBench, and they provide answers directly without guidance, allowing us to measure their unaided spatial reasoning and planning abilities. The results shown in Table 3 indicate that human achieve near-perfect performance across nearly all tasks with an overall score of 96.40. Humans perform particularly well on higher-level tasks: symbolic reasoning, causality, and planning, and all achieve essentially 100% accuracy, while even lower-level observation and topology tasks maintain strong performance. Across all levels, humans exhibit not only higher absolute accuracy but also more consistent performance, reflecting robust generalization and contextual understanding that MLLMs have yet to fully achieve. These findings underscore the substantial gap that still exists between human and machine spatial intelligence. While MLLMs show promising abilities in extracting visual information and reasoning about simple topological relations, they remain far from matching human performance in tasks that require integrating high-level reasoning. This test thus provides a clear target for future model development, highlighting the need to enhance multi-step reasoning and context-sensitive planning in MLLMs.\nFigure 6 shows an example of the differences between Gemini and human. The human focuses on the key directional cue: the turning path of the white Volvo, and quickly eliminates irrelevant options based on spatial orientation, demonstrating strong goal-directed and spatially grounded reasoning. In contrast, Gemini describes the entire scene in a more exhaustive but unfocused manner, mentioning many vehicles and areas without identifying the crucial spatial relationship. This suggests that while MLLMs can recognize objects and describe scenes accurately, they often lack selective attention and directional understanding, leading them to infer by association rather than by reasoning about movement and geometry.",

        "paragraphs": "To provide a unified measure of a model\u2019s spatial cognitive competence, we introduce an overall score that integrates performance across all five hierarchical cognitive levels. The goal of this metric is not merely to average accuracy, but to construct a complexity-aware evaluation that reflects the progressively demanding nature of spatial cognition. Lower levels mainly involve perceptual and geometric understanding, while higher levels require abstract reasoning, causal inference, and planning. A meaningful overall score must therefore (1) preserve the relative importance of each cognitive level, (2) emphasize higher-level reasoning without overwhelming lower-level contributions, and (3) maintain fairness across categories with different question counts and variances.\nTo achieve these goals, we design a weighting mechanism that adaptively adjusts each level\u2019s contribution based on its intrinsic difficulty and score distribution. Instead of manually assigning fixed weights, we formulate an optimization-driven approach that learns monotonic, complexity-aligned weights while controlling the imbalance between levels. This results in an overall metric that is interpretable, robust to distributional differences across task categories, and sensitive to a model\u2019s true cognitive progression rather than raw accuracy alone.\nTo formalize the construction of our overall score, we assign adaptive weights to the five cognitive levels ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 i=1,2,3,4,5 corresponding to Observation through Planning). Our goal is to encourage higher performance on more complex cognitive abilities while preserving a balanced contribution across levels.\nWe begin by computing, for each level, the empirical standard deviation\nwhich reflects the intrinsic difficulty and discriminative range of that category. This quantity is paired with the category\u2019s question proportion (i.e., its initial weight)\nserving as the baseline weighting factor. To introduce controlled adaptivity, we adjust these baseline weights through\nwhere \u03b1 \\alpha is a manually chosen hyperparameter governing the balance between the baseline distribution D i D_{i} and the optimized adjustment E i E_{i} . The resulting effective weight for each category is then\nwhich we require to increase monotonically with cognitive complexity.\nTo obtain a smooth hierarchy of difficulty, we further aim to make the increments between adjacent levels as uniform as possible. This leads to the following constrained nonlinear optimization problem:\nwhere the parameter k k expresses the preference for maintaining the original baseline separation prescribed by the standard deviations S i S_{i} . Solving Problem (P) yields a set of complexity-aware weights C i C_{i} , which are subsequently combined with the per-level average model ratings to produce the final overall score.\nMathematically, the original formulation introduces strict inequality constraints\nwhich renders the feasible region\nan open set in Euclidean space. As a result, the constraint set is not compact and is incompatible with the standard form required by many numerical optimization solvers; specifically, it does not contain the closed and bounded simplex\nRather than transforming the problem into a fully standardized form, which would introduce unnecessary complications and yield no practical benefit, we relax the strict inequalities to non-strict ones and solve the following modified program:\nThe relaxation makes the feasible set closed and compatible with standard numerical solvers, while preserving the essential structural constraint that higher-level categories should not receive smaller weights than lower ones. After solving P ) \u2032 \\text{P})^{\\prime} , we simply discard degenerate solutions in which\nsince such solutions violate the intended strictly increasing hierarchy of cognitive complexity. This procedure is computationally effective and fully adequate for our application, as the optimization landscape naturally favors non-degenerate solutions when k k is chosen appropriately.\nThe new constraint set is now in standard form. Since both\nare closed subsets of the Euclidean space, and their intersection (our new feasible region) is also closed.\nRecall that F i = \u03b1 \u200b D i + 0.1 \u200b ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u200b E i F_{i}=\\alpha D_{i}+0.1(1-\\alpha)E_{i} which is continuous in each E i E_{i} , Consequently, C i = F i \u200b S i C_{i}=F_{i}S_{i} is also continuous since S i S_{i} is constant. Therefore,\nis continuous as well. Let \ud835\udc04 = ( E 1 , E 2 , \u2026 \u200b E 5 ) \\mathbf{E}=(E_{1},E_{2},...E_{5}) , since each C i C_{i} is a continuous function of \ud835\udc04 \\mathbf{E} , define\nwhich is continuous in \ud835\udc04 \\mathbf{E} . Their linear combination\nremains continuous. Thus,\nis also continuous because it is constructed from addition and squaring of continuous functions. Hence,\nis a continuous function of \ud835\udc04 \\mathbf{E} .\nBy the Extreme Value Theorem, any continuous function on a closed and bounded feasible region must attain its minimum. Therefore, problem P ) \u2032 \\text{P})^{\\prime} admits at least one global minimizer under the new constraint formulation.\nTo numerically solve the nonlinear programming problem, we employ the scipy.optimize.minimize function in Python. We evaluate multiple combinations of ( \u03b1 , k ) (\\alpha,k) , and observe that ( \u03b1 , k ) = ( 0.4 , 0.01 ) (\\alpha,k)=(0.4,0.01) yields a particularly favorable optimum. Under this setting, the optimizer returns\nachieving\nwhich is substantially lower than the variance obtained when \u03b1 = 0 \\alpha=0 , where the optimal solution becomes\nwith\nMoreover, the chosen parameter setting effectively resolves the initial undesirable ordering issue observed when \u03b1 = 1 \\alpha=1 , where the resulting sequence satisfies\nviolating the monotonicity condition. In contrast, ( \u03b1 , k ) = ( 0.4 , 0.01 ) (\\alpha,k)=(0.4,0.01) produces a monotone and well-behaved solution consistent with our design constraints.",

        "paragraphs": "To further illustrate the challenges of video-based spatial reasoning, we analyze a representative failure case from the causal reasoning category, and the results are shown in Figure 7 . The question asks where a white Volvo S60 would most likely pass if it turns right and continues straight. While the ground truth is option D, the two evaluated MLLMs exhibit markedly different behaviors. MLLM1 demonstrates strong perceptual grounding: it accurately identifies the Volvo, reconstructs the forward scene layout, and reasons about nearby landmarks such as a black Mercedes and empty parking spots. However, its reasoning deteriorates once the camera performs a U-turn, causing the model to implicitly assume that the camera\u2019s motion still reflects the Volvo\u2019s hypothetical trajectory; this misalignment leads it to break the continuity of the reconstructed scene and misinterpret the spatial ordering. In contrast, MLLM2 fails much earlier and provides only a superficial description. It implicitly treats the camera\u2019s viewing direction as the Volvo\u2019s movement direction, confusing left/right relations and ultimately selecting an incorrect parking area. Human annotators, however, easily recognize that options A\u2013C lie in the opposite direction of a right turn, and that the Volvo would naturally drive toward the black Mercedes, making D the only plausible answer. This case reveals a critical limitation: weaker models struggle to form any coherent scene representation, while stronger models can reconstruct static layouts but fail to maintain spatial consistency across continuous camera motion. Even when stable landmarks (e.g., the covered car) exist to support scene continuity, current models do not reliably leverage them. Overall, this example demonstrates that successful causal reasoning in dynamic scenes fundamentally depends on robust 3D scene reconstruction and continuity tracking\u2014capabilities that remain insufficiently developed in existing MLLMs.",

        "title": "Appendix C Egocentric Reasoning Breakdown",
        "paragraphs": "We further examine two representative failure cases involving egocentric direction reasoning in both indoor and outdoor environments. For the indoor case shown in Figure 8 , the task requires determining the relative direction of an AC control panel from the perspective of a robot standing on top of the projector and facing the whiteboard. While the ground truth is Backward, the model incorrectly predicts Left. A close inspection of the reasoning trace reveals that although the model correctly identifies the projector, the whiteboard, and the AC control panel within the room, it fails at the final spatial transformation: converting absolute room layout into the camera\u2019s egocentric frame. The model implicitly adopts the recorder\u2019s viewing direction as the reference frame, causing a systematic rotation of its inferred directions. As a result, the AC control panel which lies behind the camera when facing the whiteboard is erroneously mapped to its left. This case highlights a broader weakness: even when object localization is accurate, current MLLMs often conflate scene-centric, camera-centric, and agent-centric coordinate systems. Such confusion leads to consistent directional inversion or orthogonal errors, especially in indoor scenes where multiple frames provide shifting viewpoints. Strengthening explicit frame-of-reference reasoning remains essential for achieving reliable spatial understanding.\nFor the outdoor case in Figure 9 , the model again fails to correctly align the robot\u2019s egocentric perspective with the scene layout observed from the recorder\u2019s view. Although the model successfully identifies the motorcycle and the black Mercedes, it misinterprets the orientation of the robot after moving \u201conto the road.\u201d Because it interprets the forward direction based on the camera\u2019s viewpoint rather than the robot\u2019s own heading, the model incorrectly assumes that the robot should turn left to move down the road. This perspective confusion leads to a reversed decision in the route-planning step, causing the model to select \u201cturn left\u201d instead of the correct \u201cturn right.\u201d The error highlights the model\u2019s difficulty in maintaining consistent egocentric orientation during multi-step spatial navigation.",

        "By jointly aligning visual and textual modalities within a shared semantic space, MLLMs have moved beyond abstract visual representations, integrating linguistic context to interpret scenes in a more structured and human-like manner.",

        "However, they remain fragmented and task-oriented, often emphasizing performance on specific vision\u2013language tasks rather than assessing spatial cognition as a structured capability.",
        "In addition, most benchmarks rely on synthetic or narrowly defined datasets, lacking the visual diversity and real-world complexity necessary to probe genuine spatial cognition.",
        "Consequently, these evaluations provide only a partial view of spatial intelligence, making it difficult to analyze cognitive processes and reveal systematic deficiencies in models.",
        "To overcome these limitations, we propose a cognitively grounded evaluation framework for spatial intelligence in MLLMs.",
        "Inspired by the cognitive map theory [ tolman1948cognitive , o1979precis , battaglia2013simulation ] in neuroscience, we conceptualize spatial cognition as a hierarchical process that evolves from low-level perception to high-level reasoning and decision making.",
        "Specifically, our framework decomposes spatial understanding into five progressive levels, including observation (L1) , topology and relation (L2) , symbolic reasoning (L3) , causality (L4) , and planning (L5) , each corresponding to distinct cognitive functions involved in human intelligence.",
        "For the example in Figure 1 , consider a scenario where a car leaves a parking lot.",
        "The model recognizes relevant entities and their spatial configurations (L1), then it understands topological relations such as lane connectivity and obstructions (L2) and maps visual symbols to semantic meanings and evaluates potential detour options (L3).",
        "After that, it infers causal outcomes of possible maneuvers (L4), and finally, it integrates prior reasoning to generate a coherent plan (L5).",
        "This hierarchical design provides a structured lens through which to interpret model behavior, enabling ability-oriented rather than task-oriented evaluation of spatial intelligence.",
        "Building upon this framework, we construct a large-scale spatial video dataset named SpatialBench that grounds spatial cognition evaluation in realistic multimodal scenarios.",
        "Unlike previous synthetic or narrowly scoped datasets, our collection is captured from diverse indoor and outdoor environments, encompassing both static spatial layouts and dynamic scene evolutions that reflect the multi-level cognitive demands of spatial intelligence.",
        "To realize the five-level cognitive hierarchy, we design 15 categories of spatial reasoning tasks, each aligned with a distinct stage of spatial cognition.",
        "Each video is paired with carefully designed questions and annotations aligned with these cognitive dimensions, enabling systematic, fine-grained, and cognitively interpretable assessment for MLLMs.",
        "Our experiments show that although current MLLMs perform well on perceptual and relational reasoning tasks, their competence declines sharply in high-level tasks.",
        "Insights from the one-shot and human benchmarks suggest that humans rely on selective, goal-oriented reasoning, while MLLMs exhibit diffuse attention to scene details, lacking a unified spatial cognition.",

        "More importantly, they reveal that spatial knowledge is not a flat or static representation, but a hierarchically organized system, where low-level perceptual and motor cues are progressively abstracted into higher-order representations that integrate semantic, relational, and causal information.",

        "Topology and relation.",
        "This level focuses on spatial relations among entities, such as adjacency, containment, orientation, and connectivity.",

        "This level represents the highest stage of spatial cognition, where perception, relational understanding, and causal reasoning are integrated to enable deliberate, goal-oriented decision making.",
        "At this level, an agent should synthesize its spatial representations and predictive reasoning to formulate coherent action sequences or navigation strategies that adapt to dynamic environmental contexts.",
        "Collectively, these five levels delineate a progressive hierarchy that mirrors the cognitive evolution from sensory perception to reasoning and planning.",

        "In contrast, Gemini describes the entire scene in a more exhaustive but unfocused manner, mentioning many vehicles and areas without identifying the crucial spatial relationship.",
        "This suggests that while MLLMs can recognize objects and describe scenes accurately, they often lack selective attention and directional understanding, leading them to infer by association rather than by reasoning about movement and geometry.",

        "Solving Problem (P) yields a set of complexity-aware weights C i C_{i} , which are subsequently combined with the per-level average model ratings to produce the final overall score.",
        "Mathematically, the original formulation introduces strict inequality constraintswhich renders the feasible regionan open set in Euclidean space.",
        "As a result, the constraint set is not compact and is incompatible with the standard form required by many numerical optimization solvers; specifically, it does not contain the closed and bounded simplexRather than transforming the problem into a fully standardized form, which would introduce unnecessary complications and yield no practical benefit, we relax the strict inequalities to non-strict ones and solve the following modified program:The relaxation makes the feasible set closed and compatible with standard numerical solvers, while preserving the essential structural constraint that higher-level categories should not receive smaller weights than lower ones.",

        "A close inspection of the reasoning trace reveals that although the model correctly identifies the projector, the whiteboard, and the AC control panel within the room, it fails at the final spatial transformation: converting absolute room layout into the camera\u2019s egocentric frame.",
        "The model implicitly adopts the recorder\u2019s viewing direction as the reference frame, causing a systematic rotation of its inferred directions.",
        "As a result, the AC control panel which lies behind the camera when facing the whiteboard is erroneously mapped to its left.",
        "This case highlights a broader weakness: even when object localization is accurate, current MLLMs often conflate scene-centric, camera-centric, and agent-centric coordinate systems.",
        "Such confusion leads to consistent directional inversion or orthogonal errors, especially in indoor scenes where multiple frames provide shifting viewpoints.",
        "Strengthening explicit frame-of-reference reasoning remains essential for achieving reliable spatial understanding.",

        "Although the model successfully identifies the motorcycle and the black Mercedes, it misinterprets the orientation of the robot after moving \u201conto the road.\u201d Because it interprets the forward direction based on the camera\u2019s viewpoint rather than the robot\u2019s own heading, the model incorrectly assumes that the robot should turn left to move down the road.",
        "This perspective confusion leads to a reversed decision in the route-planning step, causing the model to select \u201cturn left\u201d instead of the correct \u201cturn right.\u201d The error highlights the model\u2019s difficulty in maintaining consistent egocentric orientation during multi-step spatial navigation."

Recent advances show that MLLMs have exhibited spatial reasoning abilities [ Cai2025spatial , Cheng2024spatial , Chen2024spatial , Han2025video , Li2024top , Yamada2024evaluating , zhu2024llava , kumar2025does , yang2023set , tang2024sparkle , wu2025spatial , li2025llava , liu2025oryx ] , and several benchmarks have been introduced to quantify these capabilities [ azuma2022scanqa , ma2023sqa , yang2025thinking , li2025spatial , yin2025spatial , tong2024cambrian , zhang2025from , li2025view ] .",

Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) [ brown2020language , vicuna2023 , driess2023palm , gilardi2023chatgpt , rohan2023alpaca , touvron2023llama ] has catalyzed the evolution of MLLMs, which integrate visual and linguistic modalities within a unified semantic space. By aligning image representations with textual instructions, MLLMs demonstrate remarkable capability in understanding and generating multimodal content across a wide spectrum of real-world tasks [ chen2023sharegpt4v , huang2023diversity , alayrac2022flamingo , chen2022pali , driess2023palm ] . Spatial cognition encompasses the processes that enable intelligent systems to perceive, represent, and reason about spatial relationships within their environment. It involves acquiring spatial knowledge from sensory inputs, forming internal representations of space, and utilizing these representations for high-level tasks [ tolman1948cognitive , kozhevnikov2023different ] . We introduce SpatialBench, a large-scale benchmark for assessing evaluate the hierarchical spatial cognition of MLLMs using first-person videos. The dataset comprises 15 question types, each carefully mapped to one of the five cognitive levels introduced above:\nObservation (L1): object counting, object size, room size, absolute distance;\nTopology and relation (L2): appearance order, relative distance, relative direction, appearance order on self-defined route, relative counting;\nSymbolic reasoning (L3): multi-hop spatial reasoning, affordance, landmark-constrained pose localization;\nCausality (L4): spatial causal reasoning;\nPlanning (L5): visual-based commands, route planning. Models. We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs to comprehensively assess their spatial cognitive abilities. In this work, we introduce SpatialBench, a comprehensive benchmark built upon a five-level hierarchical spatial cognition framework that progressively evaluates MLLMs from low-level observation to high-level planning. This layered design reflects the cognitive progression from perception to decision-making, enabling a more interpretable and fine-grained diagnosis of multimodal spatial intelligence. To provide a unified measure of a model\u2019s spatial cognitive competence, we introduce an overall score that integrates performance across all five hierarchical cognitive levels. The goal of this metric is not merely to average accuracy, but to construct a complexity-aware evaluation that reflects the progressively demanding nature of spatial cognition. To further illustrate the challenges of video-based spatial reasoning, we analyze a representative failure case from the causal reasoning category, and the results are shown in Figure 7 . The question asks where a white Volvo S60 would most likely pass if it turns right and continues straight. We further examine two representative failure cases involving egocentric direction reasoning in both indoor and outdoor environments.

        "paragraphs": "With the development of artificial intelligence technology, embodied intelligence has received widespread attention. Embodied agent task planning is an important component of embodied AI systems. Task planning of Embodied Agent refers to the process in which the agent decomposes high level goals into executable action sequences through perception, reasoning and decision-making in the physical environment, and dynamically adjusts strategies to cope with environmental changes ( liu2024aligning ) .\nThe rapid development of LLMs has endowed them with rich commonsense knowledge and powerful logical reasoning capabilities. Empowering embodied intelligence with LLMs is an inevitable trend. The AI agent workflow will drive large-scale AI progress in the future, even more than the next-generation basic models. Many studies utilize LLM Agents workflow for embodied task planning and have achieved excellent performance ( choi2024lota ; babu2025adaptive ) .\nAlthough significant progress has been made, most of the existing studies have not taken into account the safety of embodied LLM agents. If embodied agents are used to perform dangerous tasks, it will pose a great threat to human property and life safety, and hinder the application of robots in real scenarios, especially in home environment. Most of the existing research on the safety of embodied task planning focuses on proposing benchmarks ( zhu2024eairiskbench ; zhu2024riskawarebench ) , lacking effective risk assessment methods. There are mainly two ways to enhance safety awareness. One is based on training, such as preference alignment ( huang2025framework ) , and training models often requires huge computational costs. Another is free-training and directly using LLMs for single-agent security detection can easily lead to the problem of over-rejection, making it difficult to effectively enhance safety awareness.\nRejection refers to correctly refusing unsafe tasks. Over-rejection refers to the tendency for safe instructions to be incorrectly flagged as unsafe. Therefore, to address the issue of over-rejection by a single LLM agent, we propose a risk assessment method based on multi-agent debate (MADRA) and apply it as a universal safety module to any task. In addition, we have designed a hierarchical planning framework for multi-agent cognitive collaboration, integrating human-like cognitive modules such as safety, memory, planning, and reflection to achieve self-evolution.\nCurrently, datasets for dangerous home tasks are relatively scarce. R-Judge ( yuan2024r ) is a benchmark for evaluating the safety risk awareness of LLM agents in interactive environments, but lacks household tasks. Therefore, we have established a dataset called SafeAware-VH, which contains safety and unsafe instructions, to test the safety awareness of agents in VirtualHome.\nThe main contributions of this study are summarized as follows:\nWe propose MADRA: a multi-agent debate framework where a critical evaluator drives iterative refinement and consensus voting, curbing single-LLM bias and cutting false rejections. The method is inherently training-free, demonstrating universality and flexibility as a plug-and-play module that can be easily applied across different scenarios and domains.\nWe have designed a task hierarchical planning framework based on cognitive collaboration that integrates safety, memory, planning, and reflection, and improves the success rate of task planning through self-evolution mechanism.\nWe build a dataset called SafeAware-VH, which makes up for the lack of a dataset in household safety. A large number of experiments were conducted on two embodied environments based on AI2-THOR ( kolve2017ai2 ) and VirtualHome ( puig2018virtualhome ) , and the results demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of our approach.",

        "title": "3. Multi-Agent debate Risk Assessment",
        "paragraphs": "The safety of embodied task planning is a matter worthy of attention. Inspired by \u201dThe Society of Mind\u201d zhuge2025mindstorms , we propose a multi-agent collaborative and debate risk assessment method. Debating frameworks, for instance, improve factual accuracy and solution diversity in complex reasoning du2023improving . CAMEL li2023camel adopts role-playing to imitate the behaviors of human society. The misjudgment rate of single-agent risk assessment is high yin2024safeagentbench , which can easily lead to problems such as excessive rejection. By adopting the approach of multi-agent collaboration and debate, we can effectively reduce the impact of individual errors of LLMs on the results and solve the problem of excessive rejection in single-agent evaluation. The framework of the method we proposed is shown in Figure 1 and the process is shown in Algorithm 1 .\nDuring the initialization phase, instantiating LLM instances, each acting as a risk assessment agent. Each agent receives a structured prompt that includes system prompt, the task instruction and a request for a structured output (Safe/Unsafe, risk category, reasoning). Agents leverage LLMs\u2019 rich commonsense knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities to assess the risk of task instructions. The input of the risk assessment agent X X is structured prompt that includes system prompt, the task instruction. Agent provides structured outputs as y i y_{i} , including assessment results, harm categories, risk categories, and reasons. The input of the i-th risk assessment agent is X X and the output of the n-th round is y i n y_{i}^{n} , the number of agents is k k . Integrate the outputs of k k agents into the set Y Y .\nDifferent agents may have different assessment results due to the differences in LLM performance. In order to guide and supervise the agents during the debate stage, we introduce an LLM as the Critical Model to evaluate the output results of the risk assessment agents. It has alleviated the herd mentality of LLMs weng2025we .\nWe analyzed the experimental results from Table 2 and summarized four main reasons for misclassification. Correspondingly, we established four-dimensional evaluation criteria to address these issues. The Critical Agent conducts a comprehensive assessment of the reasoning process of the risk assessment agent and scores them from four dimensions.\nThe first dimension is Logical Soundness, which assesses whether the agent over-interprets. Over-interprets refer to single agents hallucinate non-existent hazards (e.g., assuming a kettle is faulty to justify labeling \u201dBoil water\u201d as unsafe). When asking an LLM whether an instruction is unsafe, cognitive bias is usually introduced. The LLM will unconsciously prefer to classify the instruction as dangerous. Even safe instructions are prone to be over-interpreted as dangerous. Therefore, the Critical Model will take the over-interpretation as the evaluation basis to score the Logical Soundness of the agent. If there is an over-interpretation, a low score will be obtained to encourage agents to produce reasonable explanations. Logical Soundness Score is S L S_{L} .\nThe second dimension is Risk Identification. We have set 10 types of danger in the prompt words. The Critical Agent assesses whether the risk types output by the risk assessment agent are reasonable. The more reasonable the type of risk, the higher the Risk Identification Score S R S_{R} .\nThe third dimension is Evidence Quality. During the experiment, we found that LLMs often imagine virtual scenarios related to task instructions. For example, a task instruction is originally a safe instruction, but when an LLM places the task in an imagined dangerous scenario, the task instruction will be regarded dangerous. Therefore, the Critical Agent will evaluate the Quality of the agent\u2019s Evidence. If the evidence is sufficient and based on objective facts, and there are no subjective assumptions and imagined virtual scenarios, the Evidence Quality Score S E S_{E} is high.\nThe fourth dimension is Clarity, which is used to measure whether the expression is clear. If ambiguous expression appears, the Clarity Score S C S_{C} is low. To enable the agent to observe all the reasoning processes of the CriticalAgent during the debate, output the chain of thought C C .\nWe established four dimensions and their weights( w L = w R = w E = 0.3 , w C = 0.1 w_{L}=w_{R}=w_{E}=0.3,w_{C}=0.1 ) based on the frequency of specific failure modes observed in our experiments. The Critical Agent outputs scores (0-100) per dimension and reasoning chains C C , which are aggregated into a final Reasonable Score S S . Crucially, this output provides **granular feedback** to help debate agents understand (e.g., \u201dimagined virtual scenarios\u201d)and refine their flawed reasoning. The Critical Agent is not designed to be unbiased, but to provide a structured, consistent evaluation framework. Unlike Discuss Agents that vote on the outcome, the Critical Agent solely scores the reasoning process based on fixed criteria. This constrains bias by forcing evaluation on reasoning process rather than output preference. The final decision relies on a consensus or majority vote among the Discuss Agents, not the Critical Agent. Thus, individual biases are diluted.\nAgents debate can fully leverage collective wisdom and make up for individual performance differences. Agents engage in debates based on the evaluation results of other agents and the corresponding Critical Model scores. During the debate stage, each agent critically evaluates the opinions of other agents and the reasoning behind the Critical Agent\u2019s scores. Agents may update their own assessments if they find compelling reasoning in higher-scoring responses. Processing critical thinking is to prevent the agent from blindly following the viewpoints of others and to maintain independent thinking. Refer to the agent with the highest reasonable score and combine the reasoning process of the Critical Model scoring to consider why some agents have high scores. If there are sufficient reasons, the agent can change its assessment results to obtain a higher reasonable score. The agents input the result after the debate to the Critical Model for scoring again, and this cycle repeats.\nOur method adopts a hierarchical decision-making approach. If the agents reach a consensus within the three rounds of debates, the consensus will be output and the cycle will end.\nIf no consensus is reached, the decision will be made by majority vote and the opinion of the majority of agents will be selected as the final result.\nThe final output is y \u2208 { Safe, Unsafe } y\\in\\{\\text{Safe, Unsafe}\\} as the result of the hazard assessment system. If y = Safe y=\\text{Safe} , it indicates that the task instruction is safe and can be input into the task planning system as Figure 2 for planning. If y = Unsafe y=\\text{Unsafe} , it indicates that the task instruction is dangerous and the task plan will be refused to be executed.",

        "paragraphs": "Unlike other jobs choi2024lota that require predefined task sets, the task planning framework we propose is universal and applicable to any household task instructions. We build the planning framework by the AI agent workflow. It efficiently completes tasks through the collaboration among agents and utilizes the rich commonsense knowledge and powerful reasoning ability of LLMs to achieve continuous learning and self-evolution. The overall framework is shown in Figure 2 and the process is shown in Algorithm 2 . Our planning framework integrates MDARA as risk assessment module. MADRA can be flexibly integrated into any algorithm for risk assessment.\n\nThe task planning framework we proposed consists of five modules, namely risk assessment in section Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment, memory enhancement, high level planner, low level planner, and self-evolution mechanism.\nAgents rely on memory to store information, retrieve knowledge when required, and apply learned experiences over time. Strong memory systems help agents maintain consistent behavior during extended interactions, recall pertinent information on demand, and adjust their actions based on historical context zhu2025evolutionary .\nThe memory consists of two parts: one is the instruction, and the other is the sequence of actions corresponding to the instruction.\nA memory database is composed of a series of instruction action pairs. Its data structure is similar to a dictionary, with keys representing instructions and values representing actions. The action sequence can be obtained by retrieving the most similar instructions.\nWe adopt a method similar to Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) lewis2020retrieval to construct the memory module of the agent workflow. The specific process is shown in Figure 2 (left). First, we build a memory database M M . The specific approach is to convert 17,000 instructions in the ALFRED shridhar2020alfred dataset into word embedding vectors through a text encoder wang2020minilm as \u03d5 ( . ) \\phi{(.)} , and store the word embedding vectors in an external document as a memory vector library. Given a new task instruction X X , compute its word embedding vector and retrieve the most similar memory m \u2217 m^{*} by minimizing the cosine distance d cos d_{\\text{cos}} between \u03d5 \u200b ( X ) \\phi(X) and stored embeddings \u03d5 \u200b ( m ) \\phi(m) for m \u2286 M m\\subseteq M . The retrieved instruction-action pairs form memory prompts that serve as few-shot examples for the planning system, enhancing LLM output accuracy and reducing hallucinations.\nIn addition, when a new task instruction is successfully executed, the task instruction and its action sequence can be added to the memory database. In this way, as the number of successfully executed instructions increases, the historical experience in the memory bank is continuously enriched, achieving lifelong learning of the agent.\nThe planning system of the agent workflow adopts hierarchical planning. The hierarchical planning system consists of two agents, namely the high level plan agent and the Low level plan agent. The inputs of the high level plan agent include environmental information, memory prompt words and safety detection results. It is responsible for generating high level plans in natural language form based on task instructions. High level planning usually describes the execution process of tasks and does not need to consider the adaptability of the underlying controller. For example, 1. Turn right and walk all the way around the right side of the bed. 2. Pick up the AlarmClock from the nightstand. 3. Turn around and walk forward to the SideTable. 4. Place the AlarmClock on the SideTable.\nThe high level plan cannot be executed directly in the simulation environment. Therefore, a low level plan agent is needed to convert it into an action sequence that the controller can execute directly. The low level plan agent needs to, based on the action types supported by the underlying simulation environment controller, utilize the planning ability of the LLM to convert the high level plan into an action sequence, namely the low level plan.\nThe low Level plan can be directly implemented in the environment and obtain environment feedback. By adopting this hierarchical planning approach, it is convenient to extend the agent workflow planning system to any simulation environment. Only the prompt words of the low level plan agent need to be modified. Therefore, unlike other methods choi2024lota ; shin2024socratic , it is not limited by a specific embodied simulation environment. The agent framework we proposed is a universal approach, featuring generalization and flexibility.\nNowadays, the design concept of agents has gradually evolved from static, fixed-function systems to dynamic cognitive entities with continuous evolution capabilities liu2025advances . Self-evolutionary ability is the core pillar of autonomous agents. It enables agents to generate cognitive iterations through continuous interaction with the environment and continuously accumulate experience, correct errors and optimize decision-making patterns during task execution.\nThe self-evolution mechanism is a structured feedback-replanning loop (inspired by ReAct yao2023react , Reflexion shinn2023reflexion ). The process is shown in Figure 2 (right). The Self-Evolution Agent takes the failed action sequence and environment feedback (e.g.,\u201dObject not found\u201d). It performs \u201dmulti-dimensional diagnosis\u201d by systematically analyzing failures across Action Semantics, Object States, and Preconditions. This process is guided by explicit failure analysis rules and constraints to ensure the diagnosis and plan correction are rigorous and non-arbitrary. These deeply reflected insights will be fed back to the high level plan agent to guide it to re-formulate a more reasonable task plan.\nThis self-evolving mechanism forms a continuous improvement learning closed loop: execution - feedback - reflection - re-planning . This design enables the agent to adjust its strategy through self-reflection when facing failure, thereby enhancing the success rate of task planning.",

The low level plan agent needs to, based on the action types supported by the underlying simulation environment controller, utilize the planning ability of the LLM to convert the high level plan into an action sequence, namely the low level plan.\nThe low Level plan can be directly implemented in the environment and obtain environment feedback. By adopting this hierarchical planning approach, it is convenient to extend the agent workflow planning system to any simulation environment. Only the prompt words of the low level plan agent need to be modified. Therefore, unlike other methods choi2024lota ; shin2024socratic , it is not limited by a specific embodied simulation environment. The agent framework we proposed is a universal approach, featuring generalization and flexibility.",

Self-evolutionary ability is the core pillar of autonomous agents. It enables agents to generate cognitive iterations through continuous interaction with the environment and continuously accumulate experience, correct errors and optimize decision-making patterns during task execution.\nThe self-evolution mechanism is a structured feedback-replanning loop (inspired by ReAct yao2023react , Reflexion shinn2023reflexion ). The process is shown in Figure 2 (right). The Self-Evolution Agent takes the failed action sequence and environment feedback (e.g.,\u201dObject not found\u201d). It performs \u201dmulti-dimensional diagnosis\u201d by systematically analyzing failures across Action Semantics, Object States, and Preconditions. This process is guided by explicit failure analysis rules and constraints to ensure the diagnosis and plan correction are rigorous and non-arbitrary. These deeply reflected insights will be fed back to the high level plan agent to guide it to re-formulate a more reasonable task plan.\nThis self-evolving mechanism forms a continuous improvement learning closed loop: execution - feedback - reflection - re-planning . This design enables the agent to adjust its strategy through self-reflection when facing failure, thereby enhancing the success rate of task planning.",

This dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating the safety-aware decision-making capabilities of intelligent agents in virtual domestic settings. The dataset consists of two parts: the unsafe instructions and the safe instructions. Each data instance contains a unique task identifier, a natural language instruction, and an associated risk category label. The unsafe instruction subset contains 400 high-risk household scenario instructions, covering a range of typical safety risk categories such as asphyxiation, electrical shock, fire hazard, poisoning, and fall risk as shown in Figure 3 . Each instruction is annotated by experts to ensure accuracy and consistency in risk categorization. The safe instruction subset comprises 400 risk-free instructions, all labeled as \u201cNone\u201d to serve as a control baseline.\nTo validate the rationality and annotation quality of the unsafe dataset, we organized a blind annotation process involving many experts with backgrounds in safety, artificial intelligence. The experts re-evaluated the risk category of each instruction without access to the original labels. The results show a consistency rate of 92.3% between expert and original annotations. This demonstrates the high reliability of our dataset. The dataset will be made public to provide a solid foundation for future research on safety-aware agents.",

All experiments were run on NVIDIA RTX 3090, which reduces computational cost compared to preference training.\nWe evaluated performance using three metrics:\nRejection Rate : The proportion of unsafe instructions correctly flagged\nSuccess Rate : The proportion of safe tasks completed successfully\nExecution Rate : The success rate of individual sub-actions during task execution\nWe adopt the LLM-as-judge method as yin2024safeagentbench to evaluate whether the task is successful.\nHigher rejection rate for unsafe instructions (lower success rate on unsafe tasks) indicates better safety,\nwhile higher success rate on safe tasks reflects better effectiveness.\nExecution rate independently measures the quality of action planning.\nFirstly, We tested the performance of the current advanced task planning algorithms on risk instructions.\nThe experimental results are shown in the Table 1 , and all LLMs use GPT-4. Although the success rates of various methods vary, the rejection rates for dangerous tasks are all very low. The rejection rates of the 8 baseline methods are all below 10%, and even the rejection rates of 5 methods are 0.\nThe experimental results show that the current task planning algorithms lack safety, which is a problem worthy of attention.\nIn contrast, the rejection rate of our method can reach 91%, and the baseline effect has improved significantly, indicating that MADRA can effectively enhance the safety awareness of agent systems. Next, our method will be analyzed in detail through a large number of experiments.\nMeanwhile, the execution rate of our method is very high, indicating that the performance of the planning system is excellent and it can execute the actions of security task instructions as successfully as possible.\nBy feeding a safety-awareness prompt directly into the LLM, the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) safety reminder technique enables the model to function as a safety detector and perform risk assessments through step-by-step reasoning. The experimental results presented in Table 2 demonstrate the effectiveness of different safety enhancement methods across various language models, measured by their rejection rates for safe and unsafe content. Several key observations can be drawn from the data.\nSingle-agent Safety CoT yields the highest absolute rejection of unsafe prompts, but simultaneously over-rejects safe instructions. Across all eight models, Safety-CoT pushes the unsafe-task rejection rate to 80%\u201393%, a 20\u201356 percentage-point gain over the raw model. However, the same prompt template flags 20%\u201342% of inherently safe instructions as harmful (e.g., 41.3% for GPT-3.5 and 23.8% for GPT-4o). This trade-off is consistent with prior work showing that naive safety prompting tightens the model\u2019s operating boundary indiscriminately askell2021general .\nMulti-agent debate (MADRA) enhances protection against dangerous tasks while reducing over-rejection of safe ones. MADRA reaches reject 90% unsafe tasks in all models, while keeping the safe task false alarm rate below 30% for seven out of eight models; for GPT-3.5 the drop is 25.7 % (33.6%-7.9%). The relative reduction in over-rejection is statistically significant. This suggests that adversarial deliberation among agents selectively sharpens the decision boundary for genuinely risky content without globally suppressing legitimate requests.\nScaling model size within the same family amplifies the baseline safety gap, but does not automatically improve the trade-off under single-agent CoT. Llama-3-70B already rejects 34.7% of unsafe prompts in its raw form versus 25.3% for Llama-3-8B; yet after Safety-CoT the larger model still over-rejects safe tasks (40.8% vs. 45.6%). MADRA, by contrast, keeps the safe task rejection below 30% for both sizes while pushing unsafe task rejection above 90%. Thus, parameter scaling alone does not resolve the precision-recall tension;\nTo analyze the performance of the task planning system, we attempted multiple LLMs as agents. We conducted experiments on two benchmarks, namely SafeAgentBench based on AI2THOR and SafeAware-VH based on VirtualHome.\nAs shown in Table 3 , to analyze the performance of MADRA and planning framework, we experimentally tried different LLMs as agents, and the models of the task planning system all adopted GPT-4o.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent planning framework achieves its core objective of enhancing interactive safety while maintaining satisfactory task execution capabilities. As evidenced by the high unsafe task rejection rates (Rej), frequently exceeding 90% in both AI2-THOR and VirtualHome environments, the system exhibits robust danger prevention. Crucially, this powerful safety performance does not come at the cost of weakened execution capabilities. The framework maintains manageable safe task rejection rates (e.g., as low as 3.5% with the Deepseek, Llama3, Qwen, GPT-3.5 configuration in VirtualHome) and achieves respectable success rates (SR) on safe tasks (e.g., up to 70.3% in AI2-THOR), indicating its ability to distinguish effectively between safe and unsafe scenarios.\nA key finding is the critical role of the Critical Agent\u2019s capability within the Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment module. Configurations employing more powerful models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4o as the Critical Agent consistently yield the optimal balance: near-perfect unsafe task rejection combined with the highest safe task success rates. Conversely, using a less capable model (e.g., Llama3) as the Critical Agent leads to a significant increase in the over-rejection of safe tasks (e.g., Safe Task Rej up to 35.8% in VirtualHome) and a corresponding drop in success rates, highlighting this agent\u2019s pivotal role in making nuanced final judgments. The overall consistency across two distinct embodied environments strongly validates the generalizability and robustness of the proposed framework.\nWe studied the influence of different numbers of agents on the MADRA performance in table 4 . We find that the number of debating agents significantly influences the performance of the Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment (MADRA). As the number of agents increases from one to five, there is a clear trend of improved safety detection capability in unsafe scenarios. The rejection rates for unsafe content consistently rise, with models like Llama3 showing an increase from 81.3% to 95.6% (peaking at four agents) and GPT-4o maintaining high performance above 90.8% across all configurations. This enhancement demonstrates that multi-agent debate effectively aggregates diverse perspectives, leading to more conservative and safer decisions when handling potentially harmful content.\nHowever, this improved safety comes with a trade-off in the rejection rates for safe tasks. This variability suggests that the optimal number of agents depends on the specific critical agent model and the desired balance between safety and accuracy. The results indicate that three to five agents generally provide the best compromise, offering substantial improvements in unsafe content detection without excessive false rejections of safe content. Therefore, taking into account both cost and benefit, we set the number of debate agents( k k ) to three.\nTo verify the effectiveness of each component, we conducted a large number of ablation experiments. As shown in the experimental results of Figure 4 , with the increase of the number of debate rounds, the rejection rate of unsafe tasks rises, while that of safe tasks decreases. This indicates that discussions among agents can leverage collective wisdom and reduce the rate of misjudgment. In addition, Critical Agents can guide the direction of Agent discussions, reduce the herd mentality of LLMs. It can be found from Figure 4 that without the Critical Agent, the rejection rate curve is more convoluted, making the rejection rate change curve more stable. However, with the Critical Agent(Baseline), the rejection rate curve changes more smoothly, the optimization process is stable, and the effect improves by at least 5%, demonstrating the robustness of the Critical Agent.\nIn addition, we also verified the effectiveness of the memory enhancement and self-evolution mechanisms. Through self-evolution, the success rate can be increased by 10%. Considering both performance and cost, we set the experiment to three iterations.

MADRA employs a critical evaluator to guide agents deliberation and consensus voting, reducing individual LLM bias and over-rejection. Its unified framework integrates safety, memory, planning, and reflection for autonomous self-evolution without retraining. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach raises the unsafe-task rejection rate to over 90% while keeping safe-task rejection is low, and maintains competitive task success rates across multiple backbone LLMs, showing strong generalizability and scalability. Compared to preference training and chain-of-thought prompting, our method requires no extensive computation, applies to any model, and achieves a lower error rate, improving both cost and performance.\nThe present work also has limitations. Our approach focuses on semantic planning without visual integration, creating a simulation-to-reality gap. Future work will develop end-to-end vision-action models and augment the framework with multi-modal data and edge-case scenarios to enhance robustness.",

        "paragraphs": "To analyze the performance of the task planning system, we attempted multiple LLMs as agents. We conducted experiments in both embodied environments, namely SafeAgentBench based on AI2THOR and SafeAware-VH based on VirtualHome. To test the performance of task planning framework separately, all our experiments were conducted on safe tasks without considering safety. The result is shown in Table 5 . Different LLMs have an impact on the success rate and execution rate of task planning, but the overall success rate and execution rate still remain at a relatively high level. gpt-4o has the highest success rate, reaching 74%, and deepseek has the highest execution rate, reaching 91%.\nIn order to analyze convergence, we statistically analyzed the experimental results and found 95% of instructions reached consensus within three discussion rounds, with 62% achieving it at initialization, 77% in one round, and 88% within two rounds. It indicates that the agents rapidly achieves convergence within three rounds of discussions.\nThinkSafe directly utilizes a single LLM agent as the hazard assessment module. The experimental results in Figure 5 show that ThinkSafe can increase the rejection rate of unsafe tasks, but the rejection rate of safe tasks also rises significantly yin2024safeagentbench . The rejection rate of safe tasks is basically around 50%, and in some cases, it can even reach up to 70%. The phenomenon of excessive rejection is obvious. It indicates that the single-agent risk assessment mode of ThinkSafe cannot truly enhance the safety awareness of agents. However, after our method is combined with the MADRA module, the rejection rate of unsafe tasks can reach 90%, while that of safe tasks is only 10%, which is a significant drop compared to ThinkSafe. It is demonstrated that MADRA can effectively identify danger and safety instructions, alleviating the problem of excessive rejection single-agent risk assessment.\nWe also compared the success rate of different methods after adding the risk assessment module in Figure 6 . Firstly, compared with the method without the risk assessment module (i.e., the Baseline in Figure 6 ), the success rate of our method is the highest, reaching 75%, which is up to about 10% higher than that of the baseline method. This proves the effectiveness and advancement of the hierarchical cognitive collaborative task planning method as Figure 2 we proposed. Secondly, the rejection rate and the success rate are in an opposing state. If the rejection rate rises, the overall success rate will decline. After adding the risk assessment module, the success rate of our method decreased, especially the success rate of unsafe tasks dropped to as low as 6%.

            "paragraphs": "To analyze the performance of the task planning system, we attempted multiple LLMs as agents. We conducted experiments in both embodied environments, namely SafeAgentBench based on AI2THOR and SafeAware-VH based on VirtualHome. To test the performance of task planning framework separately, all our experiments were conducted on safe tasks without considering safety. The result is shown in Table 5 . Different LLMs have an impact on the success rate and execution rate of task planning, but the overall success rate and execution rate still remain at a relatively high level. gpt-4o has the highest success rate, reaching 74%, and deepseek has the highest execution rate, reaching 91%.\nIn order to analyze convergence, we statistically analyzed the experimental results and found 95% of instructions reached consensus within three discussion rounds, with 62% achieving it at initialization, 77% in one round, and 88% within two rounds. It indicates that the agents rapidly achieves convergence within three rounds of discussions.\nThinkSafe directly utilizes a single LLM agent as the hazard assessment module. The experimental results in Figure 5 show that ThinkSafe can increase the rejection rate of unsafe tasks, but the rejection rate of safe tasks also rises significantly yin2024safeagentbench . The rejection rate of safe tasks is basically around 50%, and in some cases, it can even reach up to 70%. The phenomenon of excessive rejection is obvious. It indicates that the single-agent risk assessment mode of ThinkSafe cannot truly enhance the safety awareness of agents. However, after our method is combined with the MADRA module, the rejection rate of unsafe tasks can reach 90%, while that of safe tasks is only 10%, which is a significant drop compared to ThinkSafe. It is demonstrated that MADRA can effectively identify danger and safety instructions, alleviating the problem of excessive rejection single-agent risk assessment.\nWe also compared the success rate of different methods after adding the risk assessment module in Figure 6 . Firstly, compared with the method without the risk assessment module (i.e., the Baseline in Figure 6 ), the success rate of our method is the highest, reaching 75%, which is up to about 10% higher than that of the baseline method. This proves the effectiveness and advancement of the hierarchical cognitive collaborative task planning method as Figure 2 we proposed. Secondly, the rejection rate and the success rate are in an opposing state. If the rejection rate rises, the overall success rate will decline.

        "With the development of artificial intelligence technology, embodied intelligence has received widespread attention.",
        "Embodied agent task planning is an important component of embodied AI systems.",
        "Task planning of Embodied Agent refers to the process in which the agent decomposes high level goals into executable action sequences through perception, reasoning and decision-making in the physical environment, and dynamically adjusts strategies to cope with environmental changes ( liu2024aligning ) .",
        "The rapid development of LLMs has endowed them with rich commonsense knowledge and powerful logical reasoning capabilities.",
        "Empowering embodied intelligence with LLMs is an inevitable trend.",
        "The AI agent workflow will drive large-scale AI progress in the future, even more than the next-generation basic models.",
        "Many studies utilize LLM Agents workflow for embodied task planning and have achieved excellent performance ( choi2024lota ; babu2025adaptive ) .",
        "Although significant progress has been made, most of the existing studies have not taken into account the safety of embodied LLM agents.",
        "If embodied agents are used to perform dangerous tasks, it will pose a great threat to human property and life safety, and hinder the application of robots in real scenarios, especially in home environment.",
        "Most of the existing research on the safety of embodied task planning focuses on proposing benchmarks ( zhu2024eairiskbench ; zhu2024riskawarebench ) , lacking effective risk assessment methods.",
        "There are mainly two ways to enhance safety awareness.",
        "One is based on training, such as preference alignment ( huang2025framework ) , and training models often requires huge computational costs.",
        "Another is free-training and directly using LLMs for single-agent security detection can easily lead to the problem of over-rejection, making it difficult to effectively enhance safety awareness.",
        "Rejection refers to correctly refusing unsafe tasks.",
        "Over-rejection refers to the tendency for safe instructions to be incorrectly flagged as unsafe.",

        "The relative reduction in over-rejection is statistically significant.",
        "This suggests that adversarial deliberation among agents selectively sharpens the decision boundary for genuinely risky content without globally suppressing legitimate requests.",

        "The framework maintains manageable safe task rejection rates (e.g., as low as 3.5% with the Deepseek, Llama3, Qwen, GPT-3.5 configuration in VirtualHome) and achieves respectable success rates (SR) on safe tasks (e.g., up to 70.3% in AI2-THOR), indicating its ability to distinguish effectively between safe and unsafe scenarios.",

        "This enhancement demonstrates that multi-agent debate effectively aggregates diverse perspectives, leading to more conservative and safer decisions when handling potentially harmful content.",
        "However, this improved safety comes with a trade-off in the rejection rates for safe tasks.",
        "This variability suggests that the optimal number of agents depends on the specific critical agent model and the desired balance between safety and accuracy.",
        "The results indicate that three to five agents generally provide the best compromise, offering substantial improvements in unsafe content detection without excessive false rejections of safe content.",

        "Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach raises the unsafe-task rejection rate to over 90% while keeping safe-task rejection is low, and maintains competitive task success rates across multiple backbone LLMs, showing strong generalizability and scalability.",
        "Compared to preference training and chain-of-thought prompting, our method requires no extensive computation, applies to any model, and achieves a lower error rate, improving both cost and performance.",
        "The present work also has limitations.",
        "Our approach focuses on semantic planning without visual integration, creating a simulation-to-reality gap.",
        "Future work will develop end-to-end vision-action models and augment the framework with multi-modal data and edge-case scenarios to enhance robustness.",
        "To analyze the performance of the task planning system, we attempted multiple LLMs as agents.",
        "We conducted experiments in both embodied environments, namely SafeAgentBench based on AI2THOR and SafeAware-VH based on VirtualHome.",
        "To test the performance of task planning framework separately, all our experiments were conducted on safe tasks without considering safety.",
        "The result is shown in Table 5 .",
        "Different LLMs have an impact on the success rate and execution rate of task planning, but the overall success rate and execution rate still remain at a relatively high level.",
        "gpt-4o has the highest success rate, reaching 74%, and deepseek has the highest execution rate, reaching 91%.",
        "In order to analyze convergence, we statistically analyzed the experimental results and found 95% of instructions reached consensus within three discussion rounds, with 62% achieving it at initialization, 77% in one round, and 88% within two rounds.",
        "It indicates that the agents rapidly achieves convergence within three rounds of discussions.",
        "ThinkSafe directly utilizes a single LLM agent as the hazard assessment module.",
        "The experimental results in Figure 5 show that ThinkSafe can increase the rejection rate of unsafe tasks, but the rejection rate of safe tasks also rises significantly yin2024safeagentbench .",
        "The rejection rate of safe tasks is basically around 50%, and in some cases, it can even reach up to 70%.",
        "The phenomenon of excessive rejection is obvious.",
        "It indicates that the single-agent risk assessment mode of ThinkSafe cannot truly enhance the safety awareness of agents.",
        "However, after our method is combined with the MADRA module, the rejection rate of unsafe tasks can reach 90%, while that of safe tasks is only 10%, which is a significant drop compared to ThinkSafe.",
        "It is demonstrated that MADRA can effectively identify danger and safety instructions, alleviating the problem of excessive rejection single-agent risk assessment.",
        "We also compared the success rate of different methods after adding the risk assessment module in Figure 6 .",
        "Firstly, compared with the method without the risk assessment module (i.e., the Baseline in Figure 6 ), the success rate of our method is the highest, reaching 75%, which is up to about 10% higher than that of the baseline method.",
        "This proves the effectiveness and advancement of the hierarchical cognitive collaborative task planning method as Figure 2 we proposed.",
        "Secondly, the rejection rate and the success rate are in an opposing state.",
        "If the rejection rate rises, the overall success rate will decline.",
        "After adding the risk assessment module, the success rate of our method decreased, especially the success rate of unsafe tasks dropped to as low as 6%.",
        "The higher the rejection rate for unsafe tasks, the lower the success rate and the better the performance.",
        "Meanwhile, the success rate of safe tasks remains at a relatively high level.",
        "So our approach has achieved a good balance.",
        "As shown in the experimental results of Figure 7 , the success rate of Baseline is significantly higher than that of the non-memory enhancement module, demonstrating that the memory enhancement module can increase the success rate.",
        "In addition, as the number of self-evolving iterations increases, the success rate of task planning also rises, indicating that the closed-loop optimization process of execution-feedback-reflection-replanning is effective.",
        "With continuous iterations, the agent system can achieve self-evolution, which can improve performance by up to 10% at most.",
        "However, it was found that when a certain number of iterations were reached, the performance would approach convergence.",
        "When the number of iterations was too large, performance would decline to a certain extent.",
        "The reason might be due to the limitations of the LLMs own capabilities.",
        "Overthinking can trigger LLM hallucination, leading the agent to make wrong decisions.",

    "lead_n_by_section": "With the development of artificial intelligence technology, embodied intelligence has received widespread attention. Embodied agent task planning is an important component of embodied AI systems. Traditional symbolic approaches ( gerevini2020introduction ; yao2020keep ) lack reasoning and adaptability for dynamic environments. Modern LLMs offer superior commonsense and reasoning, enhanced by prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought ( wei2022chain ) and Tree-of-Thoughts ( yao2023tree ) . The safety of embodied task planning is a matter worthy of attention. Inspired by \u201dThe Society of Mind\u201d zhuge2025mindstorms , we propose a multi-agent collaborative and debate risk assessment method. Unlike other jobs choi2024lota that require predefined task sets, the task planning framework we propose is universal and applicable to any household task instructions. We build the planning framework by the AI agent workflow. We have established a risk assessment dataset based on Virtualhome, called SafeAware-VH, which is a resource specifically designed for safety research in simulated household environments. This dataset provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating the safety-aware decision-making capabilities of intelligent agents in virtual domestic settings. The experiment of our method is performed in two embodied environments: SafeAgentEnv yin2024safeagentbench (based on AI2-THOR) and SafeAware-VH (based on VirtualHome) that we proposed. Both use low level controllers to map high level actions to executable APIs, supporting 17 and 8 actions respectively for household tasks. In this paper, we proposed MADRA, a training-free risk assessment framework based on multi-agent debate, and a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning architecture. MADRA employs a critical evaluator to guide agents deliberation and consensus voting, reducing individual LLM bias and over-rejection. To analyze the performance of the task planning system, we attempted multiple LLMs as agents. We conducted experiments in both embodied environments, namely SafeAgentBench based on AI2THOR and SafeAware-VH based on VirtualHome. Place an Egg inside the Microwave, close the Microwave door, and start the microwave. Harm_categories: None\nRisk_categories: None\nReason: Microwaving an egg with the door properly closed is a normal cooking operation. While eggs may sometimes burst during heating, this is an expected outcome that doesn\u2019t pose significant danger when standard microwave safety precautions are followed. To evaluate the assessments of each agent, I will analyze them based on the provided evaluation standards, particularly focusing on their logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Assessment: Safe\nReasoning: Claims that microwaving an egg is a normal operation and acknowledges that while eggs may burst, this is not significant when standard safety precautions are followed. Based on the scores calculated, here is the final ranking of the agents:\nAgent3 (Score 91) Agent 3 provides a well-supported and clear assessment of the risks involved in microwaving an egg, identifying both the mechanics of potential explosion and the resulting injuries. Agent2 (Score 79) Agent 2 accurately identifies the explosion risk but lacks some depth in exploring other potential hazards. Harm_categories: Harm to human\nRisk_categories: Explosion\nReason: Microwaving an egg can cause pressure build-up inside the egg, leading to an explosion. This poses a risk of injury from hot contents and debris. To evaluate the assessments provided by the three agents, I\u2019ll analyze each one based on the evaluation standards outlined, focusing on logical consistency, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Assessment: Unsafe\nReasoning: Microwaving an egg can cause a pressure build-up leading to an explosion, posing a risk of injury from hot contents and debris. Agent 1: 74.3\nAgent 2: 77.4\nAgent 3: 77.4 Both Agents 2 and 3 provided reasonable assessments with strong logical consistency and risk identification, but Agent 2 slightly edged ahead due to its broader recognition of potential hazards. Agent2 (Score 77.4) Agent 2 provided a comprehensive assessment with clear identification of both fire hazard and explosion risks, demonstrating strong logical soundness and clarity. Agent3 (Score 77.4) Agent 3 delivered a well-reasoned assessment focusing on the explosion risk, but did not identify any additional hazards.

        "paragraphs": "The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, driven by anthropogenic climate change, pose a significant and escalating threat to global society and ecosystems. A deep understanding of the physical mechanisms and developmental processes behind these events is therefore paramount. Such analysis is not only critical for accurate attribution and improving future forecasts but is also fundamental to comprehending the broader dynamics of our changing Earth system. However, the prevailing approach to this diagnostic analysis remains a deeply labor-intensive endeavor, reliant on a small pool of meteorological experts who apply years of accumulated, specialized knowledge to each case. In an era of accelerating climate change, where such events are becoming commonplace, this manual paradigm is proving unsustainable. A vast and growing number of events remain unanalyzed, leaving critical patterns and insights undiscovered and hindering our collective ability to adapt.\nThis critical gap in diagnostic analysis arises in part from the prevailing trajectory of AI development in Earth system science, which has prioritized the development of powerful predictive models over tools that can automate and scale scientific understanding. While forecasting models like Pangu-Weather bi2023accurate , GraphCast lam2023learning , and FengWu chen2023fengwu have achieved remarkable success, they do not address the fundamental challenge of condensing and reasoning with the vast body of expert knowledge required for diagnostic analysis.Consequently, the equally crucial domain of post-event analysis, which involves understanding the complex atmospheric dynamics and physical mechanisms that precipitate an extreme event, has been largely overlooked. This diagnostic process is fundamental to improving future forecasts, refining climate models, and informing effective disaster mitigation strategies. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and intelligent agents presents a promising new frontier, yet their application in this specialized domain is hampered by the critical limitation that their vast knowledge is unmoored from the physical reality captured in high-dimensional meteorological datasets. Without the ability to access, process, and reason over observational data, their analytical potential remains untapped.\nTo bridge this chasm between abstract reasoning and data-driven scientific inquiry, we introduce the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework designed specifically for the diagnostic analysis of extreme weather events. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , EWE operationalizes the workflow of a human expert. For any given event, it first leverages its embedded meteorological knowledge to formulate a structured analytical plan. It then utilizes a specialized toolkit to retrieve and process vast quantities of relevant meteorological data for the specific time and location. Crucially, EWE autonomously generates Python-based visualization tools to transform raw numerical data into interpretable formats, such as synoptic charts and diagnostic plots. These visualizations are then interpreted by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), enabling a holistic analysis that captures global patterns and key atmospheric features, mirroring the diagnostic process of human experts and enhancing the credibility of its findings.\nAt its core, the EWE framework integrates three synergistic components:\na) Knowledge-Enhanced Planning guides the analysis workflow and constrains LLM hallucinations by decomposing complex tasks into knowledge-anchored sub-tasks, leveraging Chain-of-Thought wei2022chain ; yao2023react prompting based on expert examples.\nb) Self-Evolving Closed-Loop Reasoning employs a unified Checker module to verify the success of each executed action, thereby ensuring operational correctness.\nc) Meteorological Toolkit provides a specialized library of functions for meteorological data retrieval, processing, and the computation of canonical diagnostic equations, which guarantees that EWE can effectively design appropriate analytical tools for a given task.\nAs the first work dedicated to automated extreme weather analysis, this paper makes several key contributions. To validate EWE and provide a fair benchmark for future research, we establish the first comprehensive dataset for this task, curating 103 high-impact extreme weather events from the past decade, sourced from the EM-DAT database and WMO reports and covering all major IPCC AR6 categories. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, LLM-based step-wise evaluation metric that assesses the entire analytical workflow, from code generation to the extraction of key meteorological insights. This provides a granular assessment of an agent\u2019s true diagnostic capabilities. Collectively, these contributions not only advance automated scientific discovery but also hold the potential to democratize expertise, providing an accessible intellectual resource for developing nations that disproportionately suffer from extreme weather yet often lack dedicated specialist teams.",

        "paragraphs": "AI for Meteorology. Recent advancements in meteorological foundation models, such as Pangu-Weather bi2023accurate , GraphCast lam2023learning , and Fengwu chen2023fengwu , have revolutionized global weather forecasting with unprecedented predictive accuracy. However, these systems are primarily prognostic tools optimized for numerical fidelity, lacking intrinsic mechanisms for causal inference or diagnostic interpretation. To address the need for interpretability, another stream of research has leveraged explainable AI (XAI) techniques for climate science. XAI methods srinivasan2020machine ; happe2024detecting have been used to uncover physical mechanisms, but often at the cost of oversimplifying multivariate interactions or requiring significant domain expertise for post-hoc analysis. Recent work has demonstrated their potential in generating severe-weather outlooks lawson2025pixels , recognizing cartographic features on weather maps takasuka2024recognition , and assisting in data processing and event diagnosis tasks zhang2025foundation . Yet, these models are confined to executing discrete, human-prompted tasks, such as generating analysis code or interpreting pre-selected visualizations, lacking the autonomy to orchestrate an end-to-end physical mechanism inquiry. Our work builds upon these advancements by proposing a novel paradigm that recasts the LLM from a passive tool into an autonomous agent for extreme event. We introduce a framework where this agent independently manages the entire workflow, from high-level event definition and exploratory data analysis to the identification of underlying physical mechanisms. This is achieved through a closed-loop, iterative process that directly addresses the limitations of prior work.\nMLLM-Based Agent. The development of LLM-based agents, which utilize LLMs and increasingly Multimodal Large Language Models as a reasoning backbone, has seen rapid progress wang2024survey ; xi2025rise ; sumers2023cognitive .

        "paragraphs": "Traditional diagnosis of extreme weather events relies on experts manually synthesizing multi-source data to reconstruct an event\u2019s physical mechanisms. This manual-centric approach is labor-intensive, time-consuming, poorly scalable, and prone to subjective biases, proving inefficient for rapidly evolving systems like cyclones.\nTo overcome these limitations, we formalize extreme events diagnosis as an autonomous exploration and reasoning task for an MLLM-powered agent. We abstract the diagnostic workflow into an iterative trajectory, \u03c4 = ( t k , a k , o k , i k ) k = 1 N \\tau=(t_{k},a_{k},o_{k},i_{k})_{k=1}^{N} , representing a cycle of Thought, Action, Observation, and Interpretation. In this loop, the agent iteratively plans, uses tools on meteorological data, and integrates observations with its internal knowledge to progressively construct a physically consistent causal explanation for the target event.\nTo implement this process, we propose Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), a novel framework integrating three core components as illustrated in Fig. 2 :\nKnowledge-Enhanced Planning . Leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with expert exemplars to decompose the diagnostic task into a plan of knowledge-anchored sub-goals.

A specialized library of functions for meteorological data retrieval, processing, and computation of canonical diagnostic equations. These tools provide the necessary empirical grounding for the agent\u2019s scientific conclusions.\nTo overcome the limitations of Large Language Models in complex meteorological analysis, such as incomplete reasoning and a high propensity for hallucination, we propose a knowledge-enhanced planning approach. This method utilizes expert-annotated chain-of-thought wei2022chain to structure the LLM\u2019s problem-solving process. We argue that for domain-specific problem-solving, emulating the reasoning path of an expert is a superior strategy for harnessing the internal knowledge of the model and ensuring its reliable application. Therefore, we propose an analytical framework to constrain the reasoning process, guiding the model to effectively retrieve, structure, and apply its latent meteorological knowledge. Specifically, we first manually annotate step-by-step analytical guidelines for different types of extreme events. These guidelines are provided to the agent for initial planning and are also stored in a memory module as persistent and robust context, which the LLM can reference when executing subtasks. This dual mechanism ensures that domain expertise constrains the entire process, from high-level planning to low-level execution.\nThese CoT guidelines are constructed based on two key principles: 1. Step-by-step Analysis. This principle decomposes complex diagnostics into a multi-scale, sequential workflow that emulates expert procedures (e.g., identifying circulation patterns, calculating diagnostic fields like potential vorticity). 2. Knowledge Grounding in Reasoning. This principle mandates that each reasoning step explicitly cites the underlying physical laws, equations, or empirical rules. By forcing the LLM to align its reasoning with this expert-defined structure, it learns to correctly access and utilize its vast but often unstructured internal knowledge.\nThe core of our agent is that it operates within a self-evolving, closed-loop reasoning framework to automate the diagnosis of physical mechanisms. This framework enables the agent to iteratively refine its analytical approach by seamlessly integrating thought, action, observation, interpretation, and multi-faceted feedback.\nThe process begins with a thought phase. At each step k k , the agent queries its structured memory to reason about the current analytical objective. This process generates a structured reasoning trace, which explicates the logic for formulating the subsequent action, a k a_{k} . This action, typically a piece of code for data processing or visualization, is then executed in the environment. The agent performs an initial self-debug chen2023teaching ; wang2024executable based on direct environmental feedback, such as execution errors or returned data, forming the primary feedback loop.\nHowever, for complex physical mechanisms diagnosis, relying solely on environmental feedback is insufficient, as it fails to detect latent flaws that do not cause explicit errors but can lead to erroneous scientific conclusions. To address this, we introduce a dual-auditor module for comprehensive self-evaluation. The Code Auditor ensures the procedural correctness of the agent\u2019s generated code. It performs static analysis to identify subtle yet critical bugs that escape standard exception handling, such as the incorrect use of tool parameters or flawed data indexing. By flagging these latent bugs, the auditor prevents the agent from deriving physical insights from corrupted data analysis. The Content Auditor ensures the semantic integrity and perceptual clarity of the generated outputs, particularly visualizations. In atmospheric science, visual analysis is paramount. This auditor assesses visualizations for issues like over-plotting, low-contrast color schemes, or occluded labels that could obscure or misrepresent critical weather patterns.\nThe feedback from both the environment and the dual-auditor system is then integrated, informing the agent\u2019s next thought phase. This closed-loop process allows the agent to continuously evolve its strategy, correcting not only its code but also its data presentation methods. If the current sub-task\u2019s goal is met, the agent advances to the next step in its overarching plan. This iterative refinement cycle repeats until a logically coherent diagnosis of the physical mechanism is achieved, at which point the process terminates.\nMemory. To support this long-horizon reasoning process, the agent employs a dynamic memory management module. This module archives successfully executed actions and their outcomes as positive exemplars to guide future reasoning. Upon the completion of a sub-task, the agent distills the key findings into a concise summary for long-term retention. Concurrently, it prunes all transient information associated with the completed sub-task, such as intermediate variables and detailed logs. This strategy of knowledge distillation and context pruning ensures that the input context remains salient and computationally tractable, preventing performance degradation from excessive context length while reducing token consumption.\nData Acquisition Tool. We developed data acquisition tools to retrieve multivariate meteorological data for specific extreme weather events. The tool queries a database by a specified temporal range and a list of required variables. For this study, it sources data from the 0.25\u00b0 ERA5 reanalysis dataset ( > > 300TB). To provide a crucial baseline for anomaly quantification, the tool also extracts a 30-year climatology. All retrieved data are packaged into NetCDF files with complete metadata preserved, ensuring direct interpretability by our AI agent. The tool features a data-source agnostic design, making it readily adaptable to other reanalysis or observational datasets.\nAnalysis Tools. We introduce the Analysis Toolkit to address a key limitation of LLMs in scientific domains: while proficient at generating code for basic tasks (e.g., plotting with matplotlib), they struggle with complex, domain-specific computations. For instance, calculating Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT)\u2014a critical diagnostic\u2014requires both deep meteorological knowledge and precise coding, a dual challenge for generalist models. Our toolkit directly addresses this by providing a curated library of pre-verified Python functions for such diagnostics. Each function was implemented and rigorously cross-validated by domain experts to ensure scientific accuracy.",

This process generates a structured reasoning trace, which explicates the logic for formulating the subsequent action, a k a_{k} . This action, typically a piece of code for data processing or visualization, is then executed in the environment. The agent performs an initial self-debug chen2023teaching ; wang2024executable based on direct environmental feedback, such as execution errors or returned data, forming the primary feedback loop.\nHowever, for complex physical mechanisms diagnosis, relying solely on environmental feedback is insufficient, as it fails to detect latent flaws that do not cause explicit errors but can lead to erroneous scientific conclusions. To address this, we introduce a dual-auditor module for comprehensive self-evaluation. The Code Auditor ensures the procedural correctness of the agent\u2019s generated code. It performs static analysis to identify subtle yet critical bugs that escape standard exception handling, such as the incorrect use of tool parameters or flawed data indexing. By flagging these latent bugs, the auditor prevents the agent from deriving physical insights from corrupted data analysis. The Content Auditor ensures the semantic integrity and perceptual clarity of the generated outputs, particularly visualizations. In atmospheric science, visual analysis is paramount. This auditor assesses visualizations for issues like over-plotting, low-contrast color schemes, or occluded labels that could obscure or misrepresent critical weather patterns.\nThe feedback from both the environment and the dual-auditor system is then integrated, informing the agent\u2019s next thought phase. This closed-loop process allows the agent to continuously evolve its strategy, correcting not only its code but also its data presentation methods. If the current sub-task\u2019s goal is met, the agent advances to the next step in its overarching plan. This iterative refinement cycle repeats until a logically coherent diagnosis of the physical mechanism is achieved, at which point the process terminates.\nMemory. To support this long-horizon reasoning process, the agent employs a dynamic memory management module. This module archives successfully executed actions and their outcomes as positive exemplars to guide future reasoning. Upon the completion of a sub-task, the agent distills the key findings into a concise summary for long-term retention. Concurrently, it prunes all transient information associated with the completed sub-task, such as intermediate variables and detailed logs. This strategy of knowledge distillation and context pruning ensures that the input context remains salient and computationally tractable, preventing performance degradation from excessive context length while reducing token consumption.",

            "paragraphs": "Data Acquisition Tool. We developed data acquisition tools to retrieve multivariate meteorological data for specific extreme weather events. The tool queries a database by a specified temporal range and a list of required variables. For this study, it sources data from the 0.25\u00b0 ERA5 reanalysis dataset ( > > 300TB). To provide a crucial baseline for anomaly quantification, the tool also extracts a 30-year climatology. All retrieved data are packaged into NetCDF files with complete metadata preserved, ensuring direct interpretability by our AI agent. The tool features a data-source agnostic design, making it readily adaptable to other reanalysis or observational datasets.\nAnalysis Tools. We introduce the Analysis Toolkit to address a key limitation of LLMs in scientific domains: while proficient at generating code for basic tasks (e.g., plotting with matplotlib), they struggle with complex, domain-specific computations. For instance, calculating Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT)\u2014a critical diagnostic\u2014requires both deep meteorological knowledge and precise coding, a dual challenge for generalist models. Our toolkit directly addresses this by providing a curated library of pre-verified Python functions for such diagnostics. Each function was implemented and rigorously cross-validated by domain experts to ensure scientific accuracy.",

        "paragraphs": "To rigorously assess the agent\u2019s proficiency in analyzing extreme events, we have curated a dataset of extreme events and introduce a multi-dimensional, step-wise automated evaluation framework. For a given extreme weather event and an initial user prompt, the interaction between the agent and the environment is captured as a trajectory, \u03c4 = ( \u03c4 0 , \u03c4 1 , \u2026 , \u03c4 n ) \\tau=(\\tau_{0},\\tau_{1},...,\\tau_{n}) . Each step \u03c4 k = ( a k , o k , i k ) \\tau_{k}=(a_{k},o_{k},i_{k}) comprises an action a t a_{t} executed by the agent, the resultant observation o t o_{t} from the environment (e.g., numerical results, meteorological visualizations), and a corresponding interpretation i t i_{t} generated by the agent for diagnostic-related observations. Our framework evaluates the performance of the agent along three primary dimensions, code, visualization, and physical diagnostic analysis. While the final report is a key artifact,we argue that a step-wise evaluation is crucial for effective credit assignment and for optimizing the decision-making policy.. Therefore, our framework computes a scalar reward r k r_{k} for each step, formulated as: r k = \u2130 \u200b ( e , a k , o k , i k ) r_{k}=\\mathcal{E}(e,a_{k},o_{k},i_{k}) where e e represents the event context and \u2130 \\mathcal{E} is our automated evaluator. The overall automatic evaluation pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 3 .\nEvent Collection. We constructed a dataset of high-impact extreme weather events by curating records from the EM-DAT database and the WMO State of the Global Climate reports. Our methodology prioritizes events from the last decade with significant, documented socio-economic consequences, global coverage (excluding Antarctica), and alignment with IPCC AR6 event categories: temperature extremes (heatwaves, cold waves), extreme precipitation, droughts, and storms (tropical/extratropical cyclones). Events without demonstrable human impact, regardless of meteorological severity, were excluded. Each event sample is annotated with its precise start and end dates, location, and type. Missing temporal information was manually verified using public sources. To ensure accurate alignment with local time, the timezone for each event location was recorded, facilitating analysis based on the natural day.\nChecklist Annotation and Generation. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework centered on LLM-generated checklists to standardize the assessment of extreme event analysis. Initial explorations with zero-shot generation yielded checklists that lacked the required granularity and contextual relevance for specific events and analytical tasks. To overcome this, we developed a one-shot exemplar-guided prompting strategy. The core of our method is a meticulously hand-crafted exemplar, which serves as a one-shot prompt. This exemplar details a multi-modal evaluation rubric for a canonical task, defining precise scoring criteria for code, visualizations, and physical diagnostics. By conditioning on this high-quality exemplar, the LLM learns to generate checklists that are both structurally sound and semantically aligned with the task. The fidelity of these generated checklists is further ensured through a rigorous human verification process on a randomly sampled subset, validating their accuracy, coherence, and comprehensiveness.\nThe evaluation rubric itself is multi-dimensional. It first assesses Code Fidelity, verifying the correctness of the implementation, particularly the data processing pipelines, visualization rendering code, and the accurate formulation of fundamental physical equations, such as potential vorticity. The rubric then evaluates Visualization Quality, assessing the informativeness and perceptual clarity of the visual outputs, including the efficacy of color maps, the precision of legends, and the clarity of all textual annotations. Most critically, it gauges the Depth of Physical Interpretation. Beyond factual accuracy and consistency with visualizations, we evaluate the analysis\u2019s explanatory power. We prioritize a coherent, physically-grounded narrative that establishes clear causal links. For instance, instead of merely stating an observation such as \u201cpositive vorticity advection\u201d, a high-quality analysis must causally link this observation to its physical implications, such as inducing upward vertical motion and contributing to cyclogenesis. The objective is to reward a demonstrated understanding of the underlying dynamics, rather than the simple recitation of disconnected diagnostic facts.\nStep Classification. Each interaction step within the agent\u2019s trajectory is assigned to a specific behavioral category (e.g., Data Exploration, Event Characterization, Dynamics Analysis). Technically, this is achieved by first constructing a textual representation for each step, which concatenates the action, observation, and the interpretation. This textual block is then processed by a Large Language Model, which leverages its understanding of the semantic context to classify the step according to a pre-defined taxonomy. This methodology facilitates the automated, granular annotation of agent-environment interaction traces, which is a prerequisite for our subsequent category-aware evaluation, where distinct sets of criteria are applied to assess the quality of different types of steps.\nEvaluation Our methodology for evaluating the quality of generated content relies on a robust, MLLM-based framework. For each classified step of the analytical process, we aggregate all pertinent artifacts\u2014code, visualizations, and textual interpretations\u2014along with the source event data and a structured checklist. This consolidated multimodal content is then submitted to an MLLM-based evaluator, which is primed with specialized meteorological domain knowledge for assessment.\nTo mitigate potential evaluator bias and ensure a fair comparison, we employ two state-of-the-art models, namely GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-pro as judge. The evaluation is conducted under two complementary protocols:\nSingle-Response Grading: Each step of agent is assessed in isolation to assign an absolute score reflecting its intrinsic quality. This protocol measures the standalone performance of each agent.\nComparative Grading: For a given event, outputs from all competing models are presented concurrently to the judge. The judge first identifies the most meritorious response to serve as an ad-hoc standard, and subsequently grades all candidates based on their quality relative to this standard.",

We therefore selected a range of state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source (LLAMA-4-Maverick) and proprietary (Claude-4, GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Pro, O4-Mini) models. For all experiments, we set the inference temperature to 0 for reproducibility. Each agent run was limited to 40 steps, beyond which the task was marked as a failure. Code and figure auditor were performed by the same model instance.\nEvaluation. We utilized GPT-4.1 for both step classification and a checklist-based content evaluation. The evaluator was supplied with metadata (variables, units, time) for accurate assessment. While we tested Gemini-2.5-Pro as an alternative, it tended to penalize correct code, leading to inaccurately low scores. Consequently, we designated GPT-4.1 as the sole judge for our evaluation to ensure the consistency and reliability.\nDataset . Our dataset contains 103 extreme weather events across six types (Fig. 4 ). The most prominent categories are cyclonic events (26.2% combined) and extreme precipitation (23.3%). The dataset offers global coverage across all inhabited continents, with a distribution skewed towards Asia (32.0%), Europe (24.3%), and North America (21.4%), reflecting global population and data availability patterns.\nWe present a comprehensive evaluation of five leading Large Language Models on a complex, multi-step meteorological analysis task. The performance of each model is quantified using an MLLM-as-a-judge chen2024mllm ; zhang2025artifactsbench across seven distinct stages of the analysis pipeline. The results, presented in Tab. 1 , detail the performance of five state-of-the-art models across seven distinct analytical stages under two evaluation settings: Single-Response Grading (SG) and Comparative Grading (CG).\nPerformance in Single-Response Grading (SG) Evaluation. Our independent SG evaluation reveals significant task specialization among models (see Tab. 1 ). For instance, while o4-mini-2025-04-16 excels at the initial Plan stage (0.974), Claude-4-Sonnet dominates the subsequent analytical phases, achieving the highest scores in event identification (Identi., 0.783), mesoscale analysis (Meso., 0.700), and final synthesis (Report, 0.981). GPT-4.1-2025-04-14 also shows strong performance, particularly in synoptic-scale analysis (Synop., 0.785).\nPerformance in Comparative Grading (CG) Evaluation. Our results show that Comparative Grading (CG) is a more discriminative evaluation protocol than Single Grading (SG). Under CG, the performance gaps between models widen significantly, particularly in complex analytical stages. For instance, the performance spread between the top and bottom-performing models increased from 0.255 (SG) to 0.360 (CG) in the Synoptic stage, and from 0.394 to 0.529 in the Report generation stage. This suggests that while most models produce acceptable standalone outputs, direct side-by-side comparison effectively surfaces nuanced qualitative differences.\nThis sharpened evaluation clarifies the model hierarchy. Claude-4-Sonnet emerges as the top performer, excelling in a majority of analytical stages: Identi. (0.802), Synop. (0.827), Meso. (0.782), Thermo. (0.750), and Report (0.950). Its superior scientific reasoning is further highlighted by its scores increasing in several tasks under CG, against a general deflationary trend. GPT-4.1-2025-04-14 remains the strongest in upstream planning and data processing tasks (Plan: 0.832, Data: 0.624), whereas models like Llama-4-Maverick show a more significant performance drop, confirming CG\u2019s efficacy in identifying model-specific strengths and weaknesses.\nExamples of Qualitative Results. Fig. 5 illustrates the workflow for analyzing extreme precipitation events, which includes two main stages: event qualification and large-scale weather analysis. For better understanding, each stage is organized from top to bottom to show the agent\u2019s plan, the code generated to accomplish the plan, the resulting visualization, and the analysis of the results. These steps correspond to the thought, action, observation, and interpretation components described in the main text. This structure clearly demonstrates how the agent decomposes the problem and performs end-to-end reasoning and analysis.\nWe conduct comprehensive ablation studies on a limited set of samples. Our framework integrates three key components: analysis tools, a code and figure auditor for verifying and correcting the generated code and analysis logic; and a meteorological Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that infuses domain knowledge into reasoning process. As shown in Tab. 2 , we evaluate the model performance on three distinct analysis dimensions: synoptic-scale, mesoscale, and thermodynamic analysis.\nFull model vs. Baseline. Our full model achieves the best performance across all three metrics. Compared to the baseline model which excludes all components, the full model demonstrates a significant improvement, particularly on synoptic-scale (+0.239) and mesoscale (+0.213) analysis. This underscores the substantial value of the synergistic integration of our modules.\nImportance of Analysis Tools. Removing the tools module from the full model results in a marked performance degradation across all metrics, most notably in thermodynamic analysis, where the score plummets from 0.679 to 0.537. This is expected, as thermodynamic analysis (e.g., calculating potential temperature) heavily relies on precise numerical computations, which is the core function of the tools module. This highlights that equipping the model with external computational tools is indispensable for tackling scientific analysis tasks.\nRole of the Auditor. Similarly, removing the auditor module leads to a performance drop, especially in mesoscale analysis. This indicates that the auditor plays a critical role in ensuring the correctness of the figure and the reliability of the generated code. Through self-auditing and correction, the model produces more accurate and reliable analyses, mitigating performance losses caused by faulty code or unclear visualization.\nFig. 6 highlights the contribution of our Figure Auditor to visualization clarity. The baseline generation (left), depicting the 500 hPa geopotential height and wind, is characterized by a high-density wind vector field that creates visual clutter and obscures synoptic-scale features. In contrast, the refined output guided by our auditor employs a sparsified vector field. This strategic downsampling significantly enhances perceptual clarity, allowing for immediate identification of large-scale circulation. A clear example is the pronounced low-pressure trough, where the refined visualization makes the southward-dipping contours and the associated pre-trough southwesterly and post-trough northwesterly flows immediately apparent. This demonstrates the auditor\u2019s effectiveness in producing scientifically interpretable visualizations.\nFoundational Role of CoT. Although there is no setting where only the cot is removed, the starkly poor performance of the baseline model serves as strong evidence for the foundational role of cot. Without the meteorological domain knowledge and structured reasoning pathways provided by cot, the model struggles to effectively utilize the tools, even when available, leading to a comprehensive collapse in analytical capability.",

        "While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored.",
        "We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task.",
        "EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit.",
        "It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses.",
        "To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric.",
        "EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather."

        "The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, driven by anthropogenic climate change, pose a significant and escalating threat to global society and ecosystems.",
        "A deep understanding of the physical mechanisms and developmental processes behind these events is therefore paramount.",
        "Such analysis is not only critical for accurate attribution and improving future forecasts but is also fundamental to comprehending the broader dynamics of our changing Earth system.",
        "However, the prevailing approach to this diagnostic analysis remains a deeply labor-intensive endeavor, reliant on a small pool of meteorological experts who apply years of accumulated, specialized knowledge to each case.",
        "In an era of accelerating climate change, where such events are becoming commonplace, this manual paradigm is proving unsustainable.",
        "A vast and growing number of events remain unanalyzed, leaving critical patterns and insights undiscovered and hindering our collective ability to adapt.",
        "This critical gap in diagnostic analysis arises in part from the prevailing trajectory of AI development in Earth system science, which has prioritized the development of powerful predictive models over tools that can automate and scale scientific understanding.",
        "While forecasting models like Pangu-Weather bi2023accurate , GraphCast lam2023learning , and FengWu chen2023fengwu have achieved remarkable success, they do not address the fundamental challenge of condensing and reasoning with the vast body of expert knowledge required for diagnostic analysis.Consequently, the equally crucial domain of post-event analysis, which involves understanding the complex atmospheric dynamics and physical mechanisms that precipitate an extreme event, has been largely overlooked.",
        "This diagnostic process is fundamental to improving future forecasts, refining climate models, and informing effective disaster mitigation strategies.",
        "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and intelligent agents presents a promising new frontier, yet their application in this specialized domain is hampered by the critical limitation that their vast knowledge is unmoored from the physical reality captured in high-dimensional meteorological datasets.",
        "Without the ability to access, process, and reason over observational data, their analytical potential remains untapped.",
        "To bridge this chasm between abstract reasoning and data-driven scientific inquiry, we introduce the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework designed specifically for the diagnostic analysis of extreme weather events.",
        "As illustrated in Fig.",
        "1 , EWE operationalizes the workflow of a human expert.",
        "For any given event, it first leverages its embedded meteorological knowledge to formulate a structured analytical plan.",
        "It then utilizes a specialized toolkit to retrieve and process vast quantities of relevant meteorological data for the specific time and location.",
        "Crucially, EWE autonomously generates Python-based visualization tools to transform raw numerical data into interpretable formats, such as synoptic charts and diagnostic plots.",
        "These visualizations are then interpreted by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), enabling a holistic analysis that captures global patterns and key atmospheric features, mirroring the diagnostic process of human experts and enhancing the credibility of its findings.",
        "At its core, the EWE framework integrates three synergistic components:a) Knowledge-Enhanced Planning guides the analysis workflow and constrains LLM hallucinations by decomposing complex tasks into knowledge-anchored sub-tasks, leveraging Chain-of-Thought wei2022chain ; yao2023react prompting based on expert examples.",
        "b) Self-Evolving Closed-Loop Reasoning employs a unified Checker module to verify the success of each executed action, thereby ensuring operational correctness.",
        "c) Meteorological Toolkit provides a specialized library of functions for meteorological data retrieval, processing, and the computation of canonical diagnostic equations, which guarantees that EWE can effectively design appropriate analytical tools for a given task.",

        "This method utilizes expert-annotated chain-of-thought wei2022chain to structure the LLM\u2019s problem-solving process.",
        "We argue that for domain-specific problem-solving, emulating the reasoning path of an expert is a superior strategy for harnessing the internal knowledge of the model and ensuring its reliable application.",
        "Therefore, we propose an analytical framework to constrain the reasoning process, guiding the model to effectively retrieve, structure, and apply its latent meteorological knowledge.",
        "Specifically, we first manually annotate step-by-step analytical guidelines for different types of extreme events.",
        "These guidelines are provided to the agent for initial planning and are also stored in a memory module as persistent and robust context, which the LLM can reference when executing subtasks.",
        "This dual mechanism ensures that domain expertise constrains the entire process, from high-level planning to low-level execution.",
        "These CoT guidelines are constructed based on two key principles: 1.",
        "Step-by-step Analysis.",
        "This principle decomposes complex diagnostics into a multi-scale, sequential workflow that emulates expert procedures (e.g., identifying circulation patterns, calculating diagnostic fields like potential vorticity).",
        "Knowledge Grounding in Reasoning.",
        "This principle mandates that each reasoning step explicitly cites the underlying physical laws, equations, or empirical rules.",
        "By forcing the LLM to align its reasoning with this expert-defined structure, it learns to correctly access and utilize its vast but often unstructured internal knowledge.",
        "The core of our agent is that it operates within a self-evolving, closed-loop reasoning framework to automate the diagnosis of physical mechanisms.",
        "This framework enables the agent to iteratively refine its analytical approach by seamlessly integrating thought, action, observation, interpretation, and multi-faceted feedback.",
        "The process begins with a thought phase.",
        "At each step k k , the agent queries its structured memory to reason about the current analytical objective.",
        "This process generates a structured reasoning trace, which explicates the logic for formulating the subsequent action, a k a_{k} .",
        "This action, typically a piece of code for data processing or visualization, is then executed in the environment.",
        "The agent performs an initial self-debug chen2023teaching ; wang2024executable based on direct environmental feedback, such as execution errors or returned data, forming the primary feedback loop.",
        "However, for complex physical mechanisms diagnosis, relying solely on environmental feedback is insufficient, as it fails to detect latent flaws that do not cause explicit errors but can lead to erroneous scientific conclusions.",
        "To address this, we introduce a dual-auditor module for comprehensive self-evaluation.",
        "The Code Auditor ensures the procedural correctness of the agent\u2019s generated code.",
        "It performs static analysis to identify subtle yet critical bugs that escape standard exception handling, such as the incorrect use of tool parameters or flawed data indexing.",
        "By flagging these latent bugs, the auditor prevents the agent from deriving physical insights from corrupted data analysis.",
        "The Content Auditor ensures the semantic integrity and perceptual clarity of the generated outputs, particularly visualizations.",
        "In atmospheric science, visual analysis is paramount.",
        "This auditor assesses visualizations for issues like over-plotting, low-contrast color schemes, or occluded labels that could obscure or misrepresent critical weather patterns.",
        "The feedback from both the environment and the dual-auditor system is then integrated, informing the agent\u2019s next thought phase.",
        "This closed-loop process allows the agent to continuously evolve its strategy, correcting not only its code but also its data presentation methods.",
        "If the current sub-task\u2019s goal is met, the agent advances to the next step in its overarching plan.",
        "This iterative refinement cycle repeats until a logically coherent diagnosis of the physical mechanism is achieved, at which point the process terminates.",
        "Memory.",
        "To support this long-horizon reasoning process, the agent employs a dynamic memory management module.",
        "This module archives successfully executed actions and their outcomes as positive exemplars to guide future reasoning.",
        "Upon the completion of a sub-task, the agent distills the key findings into a concise summary for long-term retention.",
        "Concurrently, it prunes all transient information associated with the completed sub-task, such as intermediate variables and detailed logs.",
        "This strategy of knowledge distillation and context pruning ensures that the input context remains salient and computationally tractable, preventing performance degradation from excessive context length while reducing token consumption.",

        "The tool features a data-source agnostic design, making it readily adaptable to other reanalysis or observational datasets.",
        "Analysis Tools.",
        "We introduce the Analysis Toolkit to address a key limitation of LLMs in scientific domains: while proficient at generating code for basic tasks (e.g., plotting with matplotlib), they struggle with complex, domain-specific computations.",
        "For instance, calculating Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT)\u2014a critical diagnostic\u2014requires both deep meteorological knowledge and precise coding, a dual challenge for generalist models.",
        "Our toolkit directly addresses this by providing a curated library of pre-verified Python functions for such diagnostics.",
        "Each function was implemented and rigorously cross-validated by domain experts to ensure scientific accuracy.",
        "To rigorously assess the agent\u2019s proficiency in analyzing extreme events, we have curated a dataset of extreme events and introduce a multi-dimensional, step-wise automated evaluation framework.",
        "For a given extreme weather event and an initial user prompt, the interaction between the agent and the environment is captured as a trajectory, \u03c4 = ( \u03c4 0 , \u03c4 1 , \u2026 , \u03c4 n ) \\tau=(\\tau_{0},\\tau_{1},...,\\tau_{n}) .",
        "Each step \u03c4 k = ( a k , o k , i k ) \\tau_{k}=(a_{k},o_{k},i_{k}) comprises an action a t a_{t} executed by the agent, the resultant observation o t o_{t} from the environment (e.g., numerical results, meteorological visualizations), and a corresponding interpretation i t i_{t} generated by the agent for diagnostic-related observations.",
        "Our framework evaluates the performance of the agent along three primary dimensions, code, visualization, and physical diagnostic analysis.",
        "While the final report is a key artifact,we argue that a step-wise evaluation is crucial for effective credit assignment and for optimizing the decision-making policy..",
        "Therefore, our framework computes a scalar reward r k r_{k} for each step, formulated as: r k = \u2130 \u200b ( e , a k , o k , i k ) r_{k}=\\mathcal{E}(e,a_{k},o_{k},i_{k}) where e e represents the event context and \u2130 \\mathcal{E} is our automated evaluator.",

        "Event Collection.",
        "We constructed a dataset of high-impact extreme weather events by curating records from the EM-DAT database and the WMO State of the Global Climate reports.",
        "Our methodology prioritizes events from the last decade with significant, documented socio-economic consequences, global coverage (excluding Antarctica), and alignment with IPCC AR6 event categories: temperature extremes (heatwaves, cold waves), extreme precipitation, droughts, and storms (tropical/extratropical cyclones).",
        "Events without demonstrable human impact, regardless of meteorological severity, were excluded.",
        "Each event sample is annotated with its precise start and end dates, location, and type.",
        "Missing temporal information was manually verified using public sources.",
        "To ensure accurate alignment with local time, the timezone for each event location was recorded, facilitating analysis based on the natural day.",
        "Checklist Annotation and Generation.",
        "We introduce a systematic evaluation framework centered on LLM-generated checklists to standardize the assessment of extreme event analysis.",
        "Initial explorations with zero-shot generation yielded checklists that lacked the required granularity and contextual relevance for specific events and analytical tasks.",
        "To overcome this, we developed a one-shot exemplar-guided prompting strategy.",
        "The core of our method is a meticulously hand-crafted exemplar, which serves as a one-shot prompt.",
        "This exemplar details a multi-modal evaluation rubric for a canonical task, defining precise scoring criteria for code, visualizations, and physical diagnostics.",
        "By conditioning on this high-quality exemplar, the LLM learns to generate checklists that are both structurally sound and semantically aligned with the task.",
        "The fidelity of these generated checklists is further ensured through a rigorous human verification process on a randomly sampled subset, validating their accuracy, coherence, and comprehensiveness.",
        "The evaluation rubric itself is multi-dimensional.",
        "It first assesses Code Fidelity, verifying the correctness of the implementation, particularly the data processing pipelines, visualization rendering code, and the accurate formulation of fundamental physical equations, such as potential vorticity.",
        "The rubric then evaluates Visualization Quality, assessing the informativeness and perceptual clarity of the visual outputs, including the efficacy of color maps, the precision of legends, and the clarity of all textual annotations.",
        "Most critically, it gauges the Depth of Physical Interpretation.",
        "Beyond factual accuracy and consistency with visualizations, we evaluate the analysis\u2019s explanatory power.",
        "We prioritize a coherent, physically-grounded narrative that establishes clear causal links.",
        "For instance, instead of merely stating an observation such as \u201cpositive vorticity advection\u201d, a high-quality analysis must causally link this observation to its physical implications, such as inducing upward vertical motion and contributing to cyclogenesis.",
        "The objective is to reward a demonstrated understanding of the underlying dynamics, rather than the simple recitation of disconnected diagnostic facts.",
        "Step Classification.",
        "Each interaction step within the agent\u2019s trajectory is assigned to a specific behavioral category (e.g., Data Exploration, Event Characterization, Dynamics Analysis).",
        "Technically, this is achieved by first constructing a textual representation for each step, which concatenates the action, observation, and the interpretation.",
        "This textual block is then processed by a Large Language Model, which leverages its understanding of the semantic context to classify the step according to a pre-defined taxonomy.",
        "This methodology facilitates the automated, granular annotation of agent-environment interaction traces, which is a prerequisite for our subsequent category-aware evaluation, where distinct sets of criteria are applied to assess the quality of different types of steps.",
        "Evaluation Our methodology for evaluating the quality of generated content relies on a robust, MLLM-based framework.",
        "For each classified step of the analytical process, we aggregate all pertinent artifacts\u2014code, visualizations, and textual interpretations\u2014along with the source event data and a structured checklist.",
        "This consolidated multimodal content is then submitted to an MLLM-based evaluator, which is primed with specialized meteorological domain knowledge for assessment.",

        "This protocol measures the standalone performance of each agent.",
        "Comparative Grading: For a given event, outputs from all competing models are presented concurrently to the judge.",

        "MLLMs .",
        "The task of agent demands strong reasoning, long-context processing, and multi-modal understanding.",

        "This highlights that equipping the model with external computational tools is indispensable for tackling scientific analysis tasks.",
        "Role of the Auditor.",

A deep understanding of the physical mechanisms and developmental processes behind these events is therefore paramount. AI for Meteorology. Recent advancements in meteorological foundation models, such as Pangu-Weather bi2023accurate , GraphCast lam2023learning , and Fengwu chen2023fengwu , have revolutionized global weather forecasting with unprecedented predictive accuracy. Traditional diagnosis of extreme weather events relies on experts manually synthesizing multi-source data to reconstruct an event\u2019s physical mechanisms. This manual-centric approach is labor-intensive, time-consuming, poorly scalable, and prone to subjective biases, proving inefficient for rapidly evolving systems like cyclones. To rigorously assess the agent\u2019s proficiency in analyzing extreme events, we have curated a dataset of extreme events and introduce a multi-dimensional, step-wise automated evaluation framework. For a given extreme weather event and an initial user prompt, the interaction between the agent and the environment is captured as a trajectory, \u03c4 = ( \u03c4 0 , \u03c4 1 , \u2026 , \u03c4 n ) \\tau=(\\tau_{0},\\tau_{1},...,\\tau_{n}) . MLLMs . The task of agent demands strong reasoning, long-context processing, and multi-modal understanding. This study proposes Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent for extreme weather event analysis, addressing limitations of traditional labor-intensive methods. EWE integrates three core components\u2014Knowledge-Enhanced Planning, Self-Evolving Closed-Loop Reasoning, and a Meteorological Toolkit\u2014to enable credible, end-to-end diagnosis."

        "paragraphs": "Web automation enables the completion of high-level tasks, such as booking flights or shopping online, through intelligent agents that mimic human interaction on webpages. These agents achieve this by interpreting high-level tasks, breaking them down into low-level sub-tasks, and seamlessly interacting with web elements. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in autonomous web navigation through their strong reasoning and decision-making abilities ( yao2022webshop ; deng2023mind2web ) . Current web agents approaches fall into three main categories: 1) Textual HTML/DOM-based ( yao2022webshop ; song2024beyond ) , 2) Visual Screenshot-based ( lin2024showui ; cheng2024seeclick ) , and 3) Multi-modal-based ( he2024webvoyager ; zheng2024gpt ) . Visual screenshots provide an intuitive, human-like understanding of webpage state, making them effective for reasoning about low-level sub-tasks. However, they contain limited semantic information, especially for special icons, and are sensitive to variations in resolution and overlapping elements. In contrast, HTML/DOMs offer precise and stable semantic and structural information that enables accurate element selection with minimal ambiguity.\nIn this paper, we leverage the complementary advantages of text and visual multi-modal information and design a multi-stage framework: A planner model takes the high-level task (e.g., \u201cBook a flight to New York\u201d) and a screenshot , then decomposes it into a low-level sub-task (e.g., \u201cFind the destination field and Type NYC\u201d). Based on the sub-task, an action grounder model processes the DOMs to precisely localize and execute the required operations (e.g., selecting <input id=\u201cdestination\u201d>to type \u201cNYC\u201d). However, modern webpage DOMs typically contain 10,000\u2013100,000 tokens\u2014far exceeding the context capacity of most LLMs. This results in token truncation and attention dilution, leading to critical information loss and significant processing delays ( gou2024navigating ; deng2023mind2web ) . Existing HTML pruning methods fall short, either relying on overly simplistic heuristic filtering ( he2024webvoyager ; pan2024webcanvas ) or requiring separate language models for element-ranking ( deng2023mind2web ) . Neither approach effectively addresses the core issue. The fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently and accurately navigate task-relevant elements from complete DOM structures.\nTo this end, we propose a Prune4Web pipeline through a novel paradigm: DOM Tree Pruning Programming. We observe that the low-level sub-tasks (e.g.,\u201cFind the destination field\u201d) output by the planner contain extensive semantic clues about potentially relevant DOM elements. This insight motivates us to shift the LLM\u2019s role from directly locating elements in lengthy DOMs to generating a locator program based solely on the low-level sub-tasks, thereby avoiding the need to feed long DOM sources into the LLMs ( jiang2024survey ; zhang2023planning ) . Specifically, we implement this concept through our Programmatic Element Filter model. This filter receives a specific low-level sub-task from the upstream Planner and prompts the LLM to generate a concise, task-specific Python scoring program . We design a heuristic-based scoring program template, requiring the LLM to generate only key parameters for better controllability and flexibility. The generated program runs independently outside the LLM, efficiently traversing the complete DOM tree to score and rank all elements. This approach reduces candidate elements by 25 \u223c \\sim 50 times , enabling precise action localization without attention dilution. A downstream LLM-based Action Grounder then selects the final element from this refined shortlist, completing the grounding task.\nTo train the models within Prune4Web, we create an automated data synthesis pipeline that annotates structured intermediate outputs from raw data with minimal human intervention. These include low-level sub-tasks for the Planner and key parameters for the Programmatic Element Filter. For optimization, we develop a novel two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly trains the Planner, Filter, and Grounder as a unified model. We initially use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with our annotated data to train a base model ( zheng2024llamafactory ) . Subsequently, we apply Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to enhance the Planner\u2019s long-term planning capabilities while integrating the programmatic filtering process into this optimization framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets ( deng2023mind2web ; pan2024webcanvas ) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Prune4Web. Notably, on our low-level sub-task grounding benchmark, our approach greatly boosts grounding accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28% , showing its core advantage.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\nWe design a multimodal web agent framework that seamlessly combines the intuitive reasoning of visual inputs with the semantic precision of HTML/DOM.\nWe introduce Prune4Web with a Programmatic Element Filter that generates task-specific Python scoring programs to efficiently filter and rank elements to address the DOM scalability bottleneck.\nWe present a data annotation method and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimize the planner, filter, and grounder. We use SFT and RFT to enhance planning and programmatic filtering. Strong empirical evidence validates our method on standard benchmarks.",

        "paragraphs": "Multimodal-based Web Agents. To achieve higher precision in web interaction, directly processing HTML source code has recently become a significant research direction for LLM-based agents ( lai2024autowebglm ; song2024beyond ) , leading to notable advancements. Researchers have leveraged the rich semantic and structural information within the DOM by developing multimodal fusion techniques ( zheng2024gpt ; furuta2023multimodal ) or more powerful end-to-end models ( lin2024showui ; cheng2024seeclick ; hong2024cogagent ; xu2024aguvis ) for precise element localization and operation. However, these efforts toward precision inevitably face the challenge of information overload ( gou2024navigating ; deng2023mind2web ; xue2025illusion ) . Modern webpage HTML sources typically contain vast amounts of irrelevant information. Feeding this directly into an LLM wastes computational resources and dilutes the model\u2019s focus across lengthy context ( gur2023real ) . Balancing HTML\u2019s precision with efficient information processing remains a critical, unsolved challenge.\nDOM Tree Pruning Strategies. DOM tree pruning is a key technique for addressing information overload challenge. Existing methods fall into two categories. The first is rule-based filtering, which relies on fixed heuristics like converting the DOM to a simplified accessibility tree ( he2024webvoyager ; zhou2023webarena ) . The second is LLM-based ranking, where the model is prompted to score and select from a large number of element candidates ( deng2023mind2web ; lu2024weblinx ; kerboua2025lineretriever ) . Rule-based approaches are too rigid and generalize poorly. LLM-based ranking fails to reduce the burden of processing long contexts. In contrast, our work introduces DOM Tree Pruning Programming, a new paradigm that addresses both limitations by having the LLM generate a lightweight locator program ( qiao2024autoact ; jiang2024self ) .\nProgrammatic Thinking for Agents. Our method is rooted in programmatic thinking\u2014a paradigm that enhances LLM abilities by prompting them to generate intermediate code or plans to solve complex problems. This approach has shown effective for general reasoning and planning ( jiang2024survey ; zhang2023planning ; wei2022chain ; gupta2023visual ; zhou2025code ; qin2024mp5 ) . In the agent field, programmatic thinking typically generates high-level action sequences that control agent behavior on the web ( ma2023laser ) , mobile devices ( wen2024autodroid ; zhang2023appagent ) , or general computer operations ( zhang2024ufo ; tan2024cradle ; wu2024copilot ; xie2025osworld ) . Our work innovatively applies this paradigm to the lower-level problem of DOM filtering by generating an executable scoring function that actively reshapes the model\u2019s input.\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning for Agents. To enable agents to learn complex policies beyond static datasets, Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is increasingly used to optimize LLM agents for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments ( lu2025uir1 ; qi2024webrl ; bai2025digirl ; guo2025deepseek ) . RFT allows agents to learn from outcomes via a reward mechanism, enabling them to master complex strategies. In Prune4Web, we not only employ RFT to optimize the Planner\u2019s capabilities but also innovatively use the success or failure of our DTPP process to provide rich intermediate reward signals ( zhou2025roborefer ) , facilitating more efficient policy learning.",

        "paragraphs": "We introduce Prune4Web, a multi-stage framework for complex web automation tasks. The complete workflow is shown in Figure 2 . The framework consists of three stages: task planning, element filtering, and action grounding.\nPlanning Stage. The workflow begins with the Planner model, which decomposes a high-level task T T into low-level sub-tasks S t S_{t} based on the current webpage screenshot S \u200b c t Sc_{t} and operational history H t H_{t} . This process is formally expressed as: S t = Planner \u200b ( T , S \u200b c t , H t ) S_{t}=\\text{Planner}(T,Sc_{t},H_{t}) . For example, given the high-level task \u201cBook a flight to New York,\u201d the Planner might generate low-level sub-tasks like \u201cFind the destination field\u201d and \u201cType NYC\u201d, as well as current states. The Planner intentionally does not access the HTML source code, keeping its focus on high-level strategic decomposition.\nFiltering Stage. If a low-level sub-task S t S_{t} requires interaction with a specific element, the workflow proceeds to the filtering stage managed by the Programmatic Element Filter model. This model implements our core method, DOM Tree Pruning Programming, to generate a refined list of candidate elements C t C_{t} from the complete HTML source code: C t = ProgrammaticElementFilter \u200b ( S t , HTML t ) C_{t}=\\text{ProgrammaticElementFilter}(S_{t},\\text{HTML}_{t}) . The resulting list C t C_{t} then serves as the sole input for the subsequent Action Grounder.\nAction Grounding Stage. The Action Grounder completes the workflow by generating the final executable action A t A_{t} . It takes two inputs: the low-level sub-task S t S_{t} from the Planner and the pruned candidate list C t C_{t} from the Programmatic Element Filter. This is formally expressed as A t = ActionGrounder \u200b ( S t , [ C t ] ) A_{t}=\\text{ActionGrounder}(S_{t},[C_{t}]) , where the brackets indicate that [ C t ] [C_{t}] is conditional. This is because [ C t ] [C_{t}] is only required for element-specific actions (e.g., \u2018click\u2019), whereas abstract actions (e.g., \u2018task complete\u2019) are grounded directly from S t S_{t} .\nIn summary, the Prune4Web framework offers a dual advantage. It uses the structured, precise information from the DOM to avoid the pitfalls of visual-based localization in complex scenarios. At the same time, its innovative filtering stage distills verbose HTML into a concise list of candidates. This effectively mitigates information overload and significantly reduces the difficulty and error rate of the grounding task for the Action Grounder.\nDOM Tree Pruning Programming is the technical core of Prune4Web. It offloads the heavy task of element filtering from the LLM itself to a lightweight, dynamically generated program.\nStep 1: Initial Rule-based Filtering. The process begins with a rule-based preliminary filtering of the raw HTML t \\text{HTML}_{t} . The core principle is to retain elements with clear interactive features based on their tags (e.g., <a>, <button>, <input>) or \u2018role\u2019 attributes (e.g., \u2018checkbox\u2019). For non-interactive elements, we extract key textual information (from \u2018text\u2019, \u2018aria-label\u2019, etc.) and attach it to the nearest interactive element as supplementary context. This step yields a pre-processed DOM tree containing only context-enriched interactive elements, serving as a more structured and less noisy initial candidate set.\nStep 2: Scoring Function Generation. The core task of the Programmatic Element Filter is to generate a Python scoring function f s \u200b c \u200b o \u200b r \u200b e \u200b _ \u200b t f_{score\\_t} for the current step. We design a heuristic-based Scoring Function Template, where the LLM only needs to generate key parameters for this template. This approach significantly improves the stability and controllability of the generated code while maintaining flexibility. Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo-code of the template. The template mimics human intuition when searching for elements using keywords. It assumes that a target element contains identifiable textual features within the HTML. The template performs tiered, weighted matching across different attributes: Tier 1 includes visible \u2018text\u2019; Tier 2 includes non-visible but high-semantic attributes like \u2018aria-label\u2019 and \u2018placeholder\u2019; and Tier 3 includes other attributes like \u2018class\u2019 or \u2018id\u2019 that may contain semantic cues. The template also integrates multiple matching types (e.g., exact, substring, fuzzy) and assigns weights based on match quality. With this design, the Programmatic Element Filter simply generates a set of keywords and their corresponding base weights based on the low-level sub-task S t S_{t} , enabling multi-faceted relevance scoring for each element.\nStep 3: Pruning Execution and Output Formatting. The generated scoring function f s \u200b c \u200b o \u200b r \u200b e \u200b _ \u200b t f_{score\\_t} is immediately executed to compute a score s s for each element e e in the pre-processed DOM tree. The system then selects the Top-N highest-scoring elements, where N defaults to 20. The impact of varying N from 1 to 20 on pruning efficiency is visualized and analyzed in the Experiments section.\nDiscussion. The primary advantage of DOM Tree Pruning Programming lies in its combination of flexibility and structure. The LLM provides high-level, context-aware intelligence by generating keywords and weights, while the hard-coded function template ensures robust, efficient, and interpretable scoring and execution. By generating a lightweight function instead of directly processing lengthy raw HTML, this paradigm avoids attention dilution from long contexts and significantly reduces inference latency.\nTo effectively train our multi-stage architecture and rigorously evaluate DOM Tree Pruning Programming, we reconstructed and re-annotated the public Multimodal-Mind2Web (MM2W) dataset ( deng2023mind2web ) . The original MM2W dataset contains only high-level tasks, per-step source code, and final target elements and actions, lacking the intermediate reasoning steps our framework requires. To address this, we used GPT-4o ( hurst2024gpt ) as an annotation tool to add rich intermediate labels for each step. These labels include: (1) low-level sub-tasks for the Planner; (2) keywords and their weights for the Programmatic Element Filter; and (3) pruned DOM trees and thought processes for the Action Grounder. After annotation, we performed secondary cleaning and manual verification to ensure high data quality while strictly adhering to MM2W\u2019s original train/test splits. Using this annotated data, we constructed a new evaluation set that treats generated low-level sub-tasks as direct input to evaluate the grounding performance of subsequent models, directly validating the effectiveness of DOM Tree Pruning Programming. Our final dataset contains approximately 5,000 high-quality interaction steps, divided into training and test sets.\nOur training strategy involves two core stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT), both conducted on the Qwen2.5VL-3B-Instruct model.\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The goal of SFT is to teach the base model to perform three distinct roles: Planner, Programmatic Element Filter, and Action Grounder. We explored two SFT paradigms: Separate Models and Unified Model. In the Separate Models approach, we fine-tune three independent models, each specialized for one task. The Planner maps high-level tasks and screenshots to low-level sub-tasks. The Programmatic Element Filter maps low-level sub-tasks to scoring program parameters. The Action Grounder maps low-level sub-tasks and pruned lists to final actions. In the Unified Model approach, we designed an innovative two-turn dialogue template to optimize a single model. In the first turn, the model acts as both Planner and Programmatic Element Filter, generating the low-level sub-task and scoring parameters simultaneously. In the second turn, after receiving the pruned list from the executed program, the model acts as the Action Grounder to output the final action. Experiments show the unified model is better suited for highly-coupled web automation tasks.\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). As SFT is insufficient for teaching complex, long-horizon planning and task decomposition, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) ( shao2024deepseekmath ) for targeted RFT of the Planner (or the first turn of the unified model). We apply RFT selectively to the Planner because the Programmatic Element Filter and Action Grounder handle more deterministic tasks that can be effectively learned through SFT. The success of RFT depends on our Hierarchical Reward Mechanism, which provides timely feedback to the Planner based on downstream model performance. The Planner\u2019s reward R t \u200b o \u200b t \u200b a \u200b l R_{total} at each step combines format and accuracy components: R t \u200b o \u200b t \u200b a \u200b l = R f \u200b o \u200b r \u200b m \u200b a \u200b t + R f \u200b i \u200b l \u200b t \u200b e \u200b r \u200b i \u200b n \u200b g + R g \u200b r \u200b o \u200b u \u200b n \u200b d \u200b i \u200b n \u200b g R_{total}=R_{format}+R_{filtering}+R_{grounding} . Here, R f \u200b o \u200b r \u200b m \u200b a \u200b t R_{format} ensures the generated low-level sub-task follows the correct format, R f \u200b i \u200b l \u200b t \u200b e \u200b r \u200b i \u200b n \u200b g R_{filtering} provides critical intermediate feedback by verifying whether the Programmatic Element Filter\u2019s program successfully retains the ground-truth element in the pruned list, and R g \u200b r \u200b o \u200b u \u200b n \u200b d \u200b i \u200b n \u200b g R_{grounding} measures final sub-task success based on the Action Grounder\u2019s output. In our design, these rewards are binary rewards (1 for success, 0 for failure).",

We compare our method with proprietary models such as GPT-4 ( achiam2023gpt ) , GPT-4o ( hurst2024gpt ) , and SeeAct ( zheng2024gpt ) , as well as state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods based on open-source models, including SeeClick-9.6B ( cheng2024seeclick ) , MiniCPM-3.1B ( hu2024minicpm ) , ScribeAgent-32B ( shen2024scribeagent ) , GPT-4o UGround ( gou2024uground ) , EDGE-9.6B ( chen2024edge ) , and MindAct Flan-T5XL ( mind2web ) .\nPerformance on Standard Web Benchmarks. On the official Multimodal-Mind2Web test splits (results in Table 1 ), our proposed Prune4Web, particularly the Two-turn Dialogue unified model, demonstrates strong performance and significantly outperforms several baselines. Notably, our model achieves this competitive performance on a moderately sized training set of only \u223c \\sim 5,000 trajectories while directly processing raw, complex HTML. This demonstrates our method\u2019s excellent data efficiency and significant potential for improvement.\nPerformance on Low-Level Sub-Task Grounding. To precisely and isolatingly evaluate the effectiveness of DOM Tree Pruning Programming, we use a ground-truth low-level sub-task as direct input to evaluate the grounding performance of the Programmatic Element Filter and Action Grounder models. Since the unified Two-turn Dialogue model cannot be easily dissected for this purpose, we evaluate the Programmatic Element Filter and Action Grounder models trained using the Separate Models strategy. We report results for: 1) fine-tuning the Qwen2.5VL-3B-Instruct model using original HTML without pruning, 2) oracle pruning (GT elements guaranteed in top candidates), 3) direct pruning and decision with LLMs, and 4) our Prune4Web pruning and decision. The results (Table 2 ) show that, given a perfect low-level sub-task, our full Programmatic Element Filter\u2013Action Grounder pipeline achieves a grounding accuracy of 88.28%. This performance far surpasses the baseline without pruning (46.8%) and significantly outperforms using the more powerful GPT-4o as the Action Grounder (80.65%). Additionally, even with the much lighter Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, our method shows superior performance on both pruning results and grounding accuracy. This experiment demonstrates that our DOM Tree Pruning Programming method achieves state-of-the-art performance in precise element localization and operation.\nTo meticulously validate the contributions of our key design choices, we conduct ablation studies and further analyses. These experiments investigate the precision of our filtering mechanism, the effectiveness of programmatic filtering compared to simpler baselines, the contribution of our multi-stage architecture, and the efficacy of our training strategies. We also evaluate the framework\u2019s robustness in dynamic online environments to demonstrate its practical applicability.\nPerformance in Dynamic Online Environments. The effectiveness of Prune4Web in dynamic online environments is demonstrated through our ablation studies in Table 3 and Table 4 . Component analysis on a curated set of 30 online tasks shows consistent performance improvements. Our programmatic filtering significantly enhances task completion rates for smaller models like GPT-4o-mini, while the complete three-stage architecture achieves the best overall results. These findings confirm the framework\u2019s generalization capability and practical applicability in real-world settings.\nEffectiveness of Programmatic DOM Filtering. We compared our programmatic filtering against a baseline where the LLM directly performs Top-N selection in Table 3 . The results show that for the powerful GPT-4o, our method maintains a high level of performance. However, its true value is demonstrated on smaller models. For GPT-4o-mini, Prune4Web\u2019s filtering boosts the task completion rate by over 5 percentage points (from 26.3% to 31.6%). For our fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-3B, the baseline fails completely (0.0%), while our structured method achieves a functional score (5.2%). This highlights that the programmatic approach is essential for enabling smaller or specialized models to handle complex filtering tasks. filtering tasks.\nContribution of the Multi-Stage Architecture. We evaluated the necessity of our three-stage Planning-Filtering-Action Grounding architecture. As shown in Table 4 , each stage provides a clear benefit. For GPT-4o-mini, starting with only an Action Grounder yields 21.1% task completion. Adding the Planner boosts this to 26.3%, and further adding our Programmatic Element Filter brings the final performance to 31.6%. This steady improvement validates each component\u2019s contribution and confirms the rationality of our complete multi-stage design.\nEfficacy of Training Strategies. We also assessed the impact of the RFT in Table 5 . The results show that adding RFT on top of SFT consistently and significantly improves the Planner\u2019s capabilities. For the Separate Models framework, RFT boosts the Step Success Rate (Step SR) from 37.9% to 42.2%. For the Two-turn Dialogue Unified model, RFT provides an even larger boost, from 46.5% to 52.4%. These results confirm that our synergistic RFT approach, which uses filtering success as a reward, effectively optimize the Planner\u2019s policy for both training paradigms.\nFiltering Recall Analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of the scoring programs generated by the Programmatic Element Filter, we measured the Recall@N performance across various backbone models, as shown in Figure 3 . The results clearly indicate that our fine-tuned models significantly outperform the zero-shot GPT models at all values of N N . Specifically, both our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-0.5B and 3B models achieve a recall rate of over 90% when considering just the top 3 candidates ( N = 3 N=3 ), and approach 95% at N = 5 N=5 . In contrast, the powerful GPT-4o model only reaches approximately 72% recall at N = 3 N=3 and ends at around 86% at N = 20 N=20 . A particularly noteworthy finding is that our fine-tuned 0.5B model performs almost identically to the 3B model. This demonstrates that our DOM Tree Pruning Programming paradigm effectively distills the complex filtering task into a simple program generation problem that can be mastered even by smaller, more efficient models. This high recall with a small N N is crucial, as it provides the downstream Action Grounder with a small, high-quality set of candidates, significantly reducing the difficulty of the final grounding step.",

Our key innovation leverages LLMs to generate lightweight, interpretable Python programs that dynamically score and prune DOM elements based on semantic clues from decomposed sub-tasks. This approach eliminates the need for LLMs to process massive DOMs, reducing candidate elements by 25 \u223c \\sim 50 times while maintaining high accuracy. Our automated data annotation pipeline provides supporting data for training our model. Additionally, our two-turn dialogue training strategy jointly trains the Planner, Filter and Grounder as a unified model. This training approach combines SFT with a targeted RFT that uses intermediate filtering results as reward signals for the upstream Planner, significantly improving the model\u2019s strategic task decomposition capabilities.

        "paragraphs": "This section provides the necessary technical details and specific parameters to supplement the main paper. Our goal is to ensure the complete reproducibility of the Prune4Web framework.\nAs described in the main paper, the Prune4Web framework decomposes complex web tasks into a three-stage pipeline. The three stages are Planning, Filtering, and Action Grounding.\nThis section further clarifies the strong dependencies between these stages. The output of the Planning stage directly determines the goal for the Filtering stage. Correspondingly, the quality of the Filtering stage critically impacts the success of the Action Grounding stage.\nThis carefully designed structure of decoupled yet dependent components is key to the framework\u2019s ability to efficiently handle complex webpages. Its core philosophy is the separation of responsibilities. Each component focuses on the task it performs best. For example, the Planner is responsible for high-level strategic planning, while the Filtering and Grounding components handle low-level perception and execution.\nTo further clarify the system\u2019s interaction protocols and operational logic from an implementation perspective, we will now detail the internal data flow. Key data passed between models has explicit types. For instance, the low-level sub-task output by the Planner is a structured JSON object, while the parameters generated by the Programmatic Element Filter are passed to a Python function. The full DOM tree is provided as input only to the Filtering stage. In contrast, the Planner and Action Grounder process shorter, structured information. For example, the Planner receives a screenshot and a high-level task, while the Action Grounder receives a pruned list of candidate elements.\nThe workflow also contains explicit conditional logic. For example, the Filtering stage is activated only when the Planner\u2019s sub-task requires interaction with a page element. Otherwise, the workflow might proceed directly to an action that does not require element grounding, such as declaring the task complete in its final step. These implementation-level details are a necessary supplement to the framework diagram in the main text, ensuring that readers can understand the system\u2019s internal operating mechanics.\nThe main paper identifies DOM Tree Pruning Programming as our core technique to address the performance degradation of Large Language Models (LLMs) when processing long contexts. This section details its core implementation idea: we transform a complex, semantics-based filtering task into a simple code generation task based on a domain-specific language. Specifically, the LLM no longer parses the DOM directly. Instead, it generates a Python dictionary as a parameter, which is then passed to a fixed, lightweight scoring function that is subsequently executed in an external environment.\nInitial DOM Processing Script .\nBefore executing the Python scoring function, we first run a JavaScript script, buildDomTree.js, in the browser environment to preprocess the live DOM. The core function of this script is to traverse the entire DOM tree and construct a simplified JSON object that contains only the elements potentially valuable for the current task. This JSON object then serves as the interactive_elements input for the Python scoring function.\nInteractivity Judgment .\nThe isInteractiveElement function within the script defines what constitutes an interactive element. This is a complex boolean logic that considers multiple dimensions. These dimensions include HTML tags such as <a> and <button> , ARIA roles like button and link , specific attributes such as onclick and tabindex , CSS styles like cursor: pointer , and event listeners detected via window.getEventListeners . The function also includes special handling for common web components like cookie consent banners to improve robustness in real-world web environments.\nVisibility and Hierarchy Judgment .\nIn addition to interactivity, the script uses helper functions like isElementVisible and isTopElement to filter out elements that are invisible or obscured by other elements. This series of preprocessing steps ensures that the elements ultimately scored are those the user can currently see and interact with. It thus transforms a large, complex live DOM into a structured, pre-filtered, and smaller-scale JSON object, laying the foundation for efficient subsequent scoring.\nScoring Function Template .\nThe core of our method is a fixed, heuristic-based Python scoring function, the full implementation of which is provided in the supplementary code. Under this design, the LLM\u2019s task is significantly simplified. It only needs to generate a Python dictionary named keyword_weights, where the keys are keyword strings and the values are their corresponding base weights, which are integers ranging from 1 to 50. The function relies on the rapidfuzz library for efficient fuzzy string matching and uses nltk.stem.PorterStemmer to normalize keywords and text through stemming.\nComplex Scoring Logic .\nThe function employs a sophisticated, multi-layered weighted scoring mechanism to calculate the relevance score for each element. This includes base score bonuses for the highest-weighted keywords and for keywords matched in the text_content, as well as match-type weighting for different match types like exact equality or phrase containment. It also uses the rapidfuzz library for fuzzy matching with defined thresholds and applies an attribute bonus for keywords matched in a predefined list of trusted attributes. This design hard-codes the complex and error-prone matching and scoring logic into the function template, ensuring the robustness and interpretability of the filtering process. At the same time, it constrains the LLM\u2019s task to a simple and well-defined generation problem.\nIn the Prune4Web framework, the behavior of each LLM component is precisely guided by highly structured prompts. These prompts act as the bridge between our abstract methodology and the concrete behavior of the models. Their quality directly determines the framework\u2019s overall performance. To meet the highest standards of reproducibility, we provide the verbatim prompt templates used to generate the results reported in this paper in the following paragraphs.\nPlanner Prompt .\nThis prompt guides the model to act as a high-level planner. It requires the model to analyze the current situation based on the user\u2019s high-level task and a screenshot, and then generate a concise and clear low-level sub-task. The prompt includes strict output formatting requirements in JSON. It also contains specific instructions on how to handle common web interferences, such as pop-up dialogs.\nProgrammatic Element Filter Prompt .\nThis prompt configures the model as a keyword extraction expert. It receives the low-level sub-task from the Planner as input and is required to output a keyword_weights dictionary containing keywords and their weights. The prompt provides strategic advice on weight assignment, such as assigning higher weights to key nouns, to guide the model toward generating high-quality scoring parameters.\nAction Grounder Prompt .\nThis prompt requires the model to act as a precise executor. It receives the low-level sub-task and the pruned list of candidate elements as input. Its task is to select the single correct element from the list and decide on the action to be performed. The prompt emphasizes the need for logical reasoning during the thought process and to output the final decision in a specified format.\n\u201cTwo-turn Dialogue\u201d Unified Model Prompt .\nThis prompt has a more complex structure and is used to train the unified model. In the first turn of the dialogue, the model acts as both the Planner and the Filter, generating the low-level sub-task and scoring parameters at once. After receiving the results from the externally executed filtering process, the dialogue proceeds to the second turn. In this second turn, the model then acts as the Action Grounder to make the final decision. This design aims to enhance the model\u2019s ability for continuous reasoning within the task\u2019s context.\nTo ensure the deterministic nature of the agent\u2019s decision outputs and the reliability of downstream execution, we define a discrete and strict action space. This action space can be considered the API protocol between the Action Grounder model and the browser interaction engine, which is based on Playwright. The actions, including their names, parameters, and functional descriptions, will be detailed in a table, as referenced in Table 6 .\nExecution Details .\nThe element_index parameter is an abstract integer index. Upon receiving this index, the execution engine looks up the corresponding element\u2019s details, such as its XPath and CSS selectors, in the element hash map generated by buildDomTree.js. Subsequently, the engine employs a multi-strategy interaction method. It first attempts to perform a standard click or type operation using the retrieved selectors. If this fails, it falls back to dispatching JavaScript events, such as element.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent(\u2019click\u2019, ...)) , to simulate user interaction. This fallback mechanism is designed to improve the success rate of interactions on websites with complex front-end frameworks like React or Vue. Any model output that does not conform to the defined action space is considered an invalid action by the execution engine, thereby ensuring robust interaction.",

            "paragraphs": "In the Prune4Web framework, the behavior of each LLM component is precisely guided by highly structured prompts. These prompts act as the bridge between our abstract methodology and the concrete behavior of the models. Their quality directly determines the framework\u2019s overall performance. To meet the highest standards of reproducibility, we provide the verbatim prompt templates used to generate the results reported in this paper in the following paragraphs.\nPlanner Prompt .\nThis prompt guides the model to act as a high-level planner. It requires the model to analyze the current situation based on the user\u2019s high-level task and a screenshot, and then generate a concise and clear low-level sub-task. The prompt includes strict output formatting requirements in JSON. It also contains specific instructions on how to handle common web interferences, such as pop-up dialogs.\nProgrammatic Element Filter Prompt .\nThis prompt configures the model as a keyword extraction expert. It receives the low-level sub-task from the Planner as input and is required to output a keyword_weights dictionary containing keywords and their weights. The prompt provides strategic advice on weight assignment, such as assigning higher weights to key nouns, to guide the model toward generating high-quality scoring parameters.\nAction Grounder Prompt .\nThis prompt requires the model to act as a precise executor. It receives the low-level sub-task and the pruned list of candidate elements as input. Its task is to select the single correct element from the list and decide on the action to be performed. The prompt emphasizes the need for logical reasoning during the thought process and to output the final decision in a specified format.\n\u201cTwo-turn Dialogue\u201d Unified Model Prompt .\nThis prompt has a more complex structure and is used to train the unified model. In the first turn of the dialogue, the model acts as both the Planner and the Filter, generating the low-level sub-task and scoring parameters at once. After receiving the results from the externally executed filtering process, the dialogue proceeds to the second turn. In this second turn, the model then acts as the Action Grounder to make the final decision. This design aims to enhance the model\u2019s ability for continuous reasoning within the task\u2019s context.",

This action space can be considered the API protocol between the Action Grounder model and the browser interaction engine, which is based on Playwright. The actions, including their names, parameters, and functional descriptions, will be detailed in a table, as referenced in Table 6 .\nExecution Details .\nThe element_index parameter is an abstract integer index. Upon receiving this index, the execution engine looks up the corresponding element\u2019s details, such as its XPath and CSS selectors, in the element hash map generated by buildDomTree.js. Subsequently, the engine employs a multi-strategy interaction method. It first attempts to perform a standard click or type operation using the retrieved selectors. If this fails, it falls back to dispatching JavaScript events, such as element.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent(\u2019click\u2019, ...)) , to simulate user interaction. This fallback mechanism is designed to improve the success rate of interactions on websites with complex front-end frameworks like React or Vue. Any model output that does not conform to the defined action space is considered an invalid action by the execution engine, thereby ensuring robust interaction.",

        "paragraphs": "This section details the entire construction process for the custom dataset used to train and evaluate the Prune4Web framework. We aim to provide sufficient detail for other researchers to understand and reproduce our data preparation work.\nThe effectiveness of the Prune4Web framework relies heavily on high-quality training data annotated with intermediate reasoning steps. Existing web automation datasets generally lack the fine-grained intermediate labels required by our three-stage model, necessitating that we construct our own.\nPrimary Data Source .\nThe foundation for all our training and evaluation data is the public Multimodal-Mind2Web ( deng2023mind2web ) (MM2W) dataset. Among the currently available datasets, MM2W is the only one that provides both rich HTML source code and corresponding webpage screenshots, making it suitable for our multimodal framework. Other datasets, such as WebVoyager ( he2024webvoyager ; he2024openwebvoyager ) and Mind2Web-live ( pan2024webcanvas ) , only release their test sets and lack the necessary raw data for training. Therefore, MM2W is our sole choice at this stage, and we plan to collect or annotate more datasets in future work.\nInitial Data Cleaning .\nBefore beginning the annotation process, we first conducted a comprehensive initial cleaning of the MM2W training and test sets to eliminate annotation errors present in the original data. The first cleaning criterion was to remove data points where the Ground-Truth (GT) Element was actually missing from the HTML source code. The second criterion involved processing the original HTML source with our buildDomTree.js script, as described in Appendix A. We then checked if the GT element existed in our constructed DOM tree. If the GT element was lost because it could not be assigned an ID or XPath, we also considered this an annotation error in the original dataset and removed the data point.\nVisual and Action Data Processing .\nThe webpage screenshots provided in the MM2W dataset are often very long, with heights that can reach 10,000 pixels, making them unsuitable for direct model training and inference. We kept the screenshot width constant and vertically truncated the long screenshots into a series of standard-sized images with a height of 1080 pixels. We also recorded which of the truncated images contained the GT element. To enrich the action types, which were lacking in the original dataset, we added SCROLL and DONE actions. For truncated screenshots that did not contain the GT element, we annotated a SCROLL action. For the final screenshot in a task trajectory, we annotated a DONE action.\nOur data annotation pipeline was designed to generate intermediate labels corresponding to the three core components of our framework for each interaction step in the MM2W dataset. To ensure absolute fairness in testing, we annotated only the MM2W training set (cross_train) . The three official test sets (cross_task, cross_website, cross_domain) were not additionally annotated and were used directly for the final end-to-end evaluation.\nAnnotation Process .\nWe used GPT-4o ( hurst2024gpt ) as the core annotation tool and designed specialized prompts for each annotation task. When annotating the low-level sub-task, we provided the GT element information to GPT-4o to ensure the high accuracy of the generated sub-task. In addition to the core labels, we also annotated extra attributes for each stage, such as the current_state describing the page status and a detailed thinking process, to support potential future training based on richer contextual reasoning.\nMulti-Stage Quality Control .\nTo ensure the final quality of the annotated data, we designed a rigorous multi-stage filtering process. The first stage was an automatic filter. After annotating the keywords and weights for the Programmatic Element Filter, we immediately invoked the scoring function to prune the DOM tree. If the GT element did not appear in the top-20 list of the pruned results, we considered the annotation or the original data to be of poor quality and completely removed that data point, including its corresponding Planner and Grounder annotations, from the training set. In the second stage of automatic filtering, during subsequent training preparation, we further removed data points with excessively long original HTML source tokens to avoid potential training issues. The third stage was manual verification. After all automatic filtering processes were complete, we conducted a final manual sampling check to ensure the overall high quality of the final dataset.\nTo independently and precisely evaluate the effectiveness of our core method, DOM Tree Pruning Programming, we constructed a specialized benchmark from our newly annotated training set. We selected all steps that required interaction with page elements and randomly split them into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). This benchmark is specifically designed to measure the performance of the subsequent Filtering and Grounding stages, given a perfect low-level sub-task.\nEvaluation Method .\nOn this benchmark, we adopted a separate training strategy, independently retraining the Programmatic Element Filter and Action Grounder models. The evaluation process consists of two steps. In the first step, a model generates keywords and weights based on the input low-level sub-task and then performs pruning. In the second step, another model outputs the final action based on the pruned list of elements. This allows us to decouple the evaluation of the Planner\u2019s planning ability from the execution capability of the downstream components, thereby directly validating the effectiveness of our filtering and grounding methods.\nAfter all the cleaning, annotation, and filtering processes, we ultimately obtained a training dataset containing 5,503 high-quality interaction steps. An \u201cinteraction step\u201d refers to a single user action within a multi-step task, such as a click or an input. Each step includes the complete annotation information required for the three stages of our framework.\nDataset Splits and Usage .\nThis dataset of 5,503 steps was further divided into two parts. A total of 4,402 steps (approximately 80%) were used as the training set for the low-level sub-task grounding benchmark. The remaining 1,101 steps (approximately 20%) were used as the test set for the same benchmark. The grounding accuracy of 88.28% reported in the main paper was measured on these 1,101 test steps. It is important to note that the training set used for the end-to-end Prune4Web unified model consists of the entire dataset of 5,503 steps.",

To this end, we employed both offline benchmarks and online dynamic websites for testing.\nOffline Evaluation on Multimodal-Mind2Web .\nOur main offline evaluation was conducted on the Multimodal-Mind2Web (MM2W) benchmark. We strictly adhere to its official splits for the training, validation, and three test sets (cross-task, cross-website, cross-domain). This ensures that our results can be fairly and directly compared with other work in the field.\nOnline Evaluation on Dynamic Websites .\nTo test the model\u2019s generalization ability and robustness in real, dynamic environments, we also conducted a series of online evaluations. We first filtered out a list of persistently inaccessible websites from the Mind2Web-live and WebVoyager test sets (e.g., kbb.com, sixflags.com, etc.).

These metrics respectively measure element localization; operation type and parameter filling; and the overall success of a single interaction step.\nCustom Grounding Metrics .\nFor the low-level sub-task grounding benchmark, we use two main metrics. The first metric is Recall@k, which evaluates the performance of the filtering stage by measuring whether the ground-truth target element appears in the top-k candidates after pruning. The second metric is Grounding Accuracy, which evaluates the performance of the grounding stage by measuring whether the final executed action exactly matches the ground-truth action.\nLLM-Verified Task Completion Rate .\nFor online evaluation, we use the LLM-Verified Task Completion Rate as the primary metric, as the final state of online tasks is difficult to judge with fixed rules.

The server\u2019s CPU is a 14-core processor with 100G of RAM. During training, each GPU process was bound to a dedicated CPU core to ensure efficiency.\nSoftware Stack .\nThe software environment for the experiments was Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.10.

The key hyperparameters for the SFT stage were as follows: we used the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 5.0e-5 and a cosine learning rate schedule. The batch size per device was 1, with 8 gradient accumulation steps, resulting in an effective global batch size of 64. We used bf16 mixed-precision for training and enabled flash_attn for efficiency. The number of training epochs for all models was 3.\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) Hyperparameters .\nIn the RFT stage, we used the GRPO ( guo2025deepseek ) algorithm to optimize the Planner (or the first turn of the unified model).

        "paragraphs": "This section delves into the specific details of the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) stages, which together form our complete training strategy.\nAll models\u2019 foundational capabilities are initialized through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The goal of SFT is to teach the model to generate outputs that conform to our predefined format and content, based on a given input. This stage provides a good \u201ccold start\u201d model for the subsequent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) phase, allowing it to begin exploration from a reasonable base policy. We explored two SFT training paradigms: separated models and a unified model.\nSeparated Models Paradigm .\nIn the separated models paradigm, we independently trained three specialized models for the framework\u2019s three core components: the Planner, the Programmatic Element Filter, and the Action Grounder. Each model was trained on data specific to its corresponding task, and their respective training objectives and input-output formats are detailed below.\nPlanner Model SFT .\nThe training for the Planner model aims to teach it high-level planning. In training, the model receives input containing the current high-level task description and a webpage screenshot. It is trained to generate a structured string as output. This output string must contain two parts: a thought process enclosed in <think> tags, and a JSON object enclosed in <answer> tags. This JSON object needs to include a detailed analysis of the page state ( state_analysis ), an evaluation of task progress ( progress_evaluation ), challenges ( challenges ), the next low-level sub-task ( next_steps ), the action type ( action_type ), and the target text ( target ).\nProgrammatic Element Filter Model SFT .\nThe training for this model aims to teach it to extract keywords for element localization from the plan. During training, the model receives the complete JSON output from the Planner model as input. Its expected output is also a string containing <think> and <answer> tags. In this output, the JSON object enclosed by the <answer> tag must contain a keyword_weights key, whose value is a dictionary mapping keywords to their weights.\nAction Grounder Model SFT .\nThe training for the Action Grounder model aims to teach it to make the final decision based on the plan and the pruned list of elements. Its input is composed of the task context, the Planner\u2019s output, and the pruned list of DOM candidates. The model\u2019s expected output is also a string containing <think> and <answer> tags, where the JSON object enclosed by the <answer> tag must specify the final action type ( action ), the target element\u2019s ID ( id ), and any necessary input text ( input text ).\nUnified Model with Two-turn Dialogue .\nWe designed the unified model paradigm to explore the trade-offs between two different optimization paths for Web Agent tasks: one path involves decomposing the task and optimizing multiple separated models, while the other utilizes a unified data stream to optimize a single, end-to-end model. This paradigm uses an innovative \u201ctwo-turn dialogue\u201d training template to synergistically optimize all three component functionalities within a single model. First turn : The model\u2019s input consists of the high-level task, history, and a webpage screenshot. Its expected output is a structured string containing a thought process in <think> tags, a low-level sub-task in <plan> tags, and a keyword-weight dictionary in <keywords_weights> tags. Second turn : After the system simulates the filtering operation, the resulting pruned DOM list is provided as input. The model\u2019s expected output is then a JSON object containing the final action, enclosed in <answer> tags.\nData Format Reference .\nThe specific data formats and structures used in all the SFT training paradigms described above can be found in the data example files provided in the code repository accompanying our paper.\nAs SFT struggles to teach models complex, forward-looking, long-horizon planning, we employ Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further optimize the model. The goal of RFT is to enhance the Planner\u2019s strategic planning capabilities, enabling it to generate low-level sub-tasks that are more conducive to the success of downstream tasks. Therefore, RFT is applied only to the Planner model (in the separated paradigm) or to the first turn of the unified model.\nGRPO Algorithm Implementation .\nWe use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) algorithm for policy optimization. GRPO estimates the relative advantage of each response by comparing the rewards of multiple responses generated from a single prompt, which leads to more stable updates of the policy model. Our implementation is based on the VLM-R1 framework and uses its default hyperparameter configuration.\nThe GRPO algorithm extends policy gradient methods by refining the advantage estimation. A key aspect involves calculating the relative advantage A i A_{i} for the i i -th response in a set of candidate responses O = { o 1 , o 2 , \u2026 , o N } O=\\{o_{1},o_{2},\\ldots,o_{N}\\} generated from a state, given their respective rewards { r 1 , r 2 , \u2026 , r N } \\{r_{1},r_{2},\\ldots,r_{N}\\} . The relative advantage is computed as:\nwhere mean and std denote the mean and standard deviation of the rewards, and \u03f5 s \u200b t \u200b d \\epsilon_{std} is a small constant for numerical stability. These relative advantages are then used to update the policy model, often under KL divergence constraints to stabilize training.\nHierarchical Reward Mechanism .\nThe key to successful RFT lies in the hierarchical reward mechanism we designed for the Planner. The core idea of this mechanism is that the quality of the Planner is determined not only by itself but, more importantly, by whether its generated plan enables the subsequent Filter and Grounder components to execute successfully. Thus, the reward for the Planner at step t t , denoted as R t R_{t} , is composed of the format reward for its own output and the success rewards achieved by the downstream components in that step.\nReward Function Definition .\nThe reward we designed is step-wise; failure at one stage results in a reward of zero for all subsequent stages. The total reward R t R_{t} is calculated with the formula: R t = R f \u200b m \u200b t + \u03b1 \u22c5 R f \u200b i \u200b l \u200b t \u200b e \u200b r \u200b i \u200b n \u200b g \u200b _ \u200b s \u200b u \u200b c \u200b c \u200b e \u200b s \u200b s + \u03b2 \u22c5 R g \u200b r \u200b o \u200b u \u200b n \u200b d \u200b i \u200b n \u200b g \u200b _ \u200b s \u200b u \u200b c \u200b c \u200b e \u200b s \u200b s R_{t}=R_{fmt}+\\alpha\\cdot R_{filtering\\_success}+\\beta\\cdot R_{grounding\\_success} . Each component herein is a deterministic binary reward (1 for success, 0 for failure). Format Reward ( R f \u200b m \u200b t R_{fmt} ) : This checks if the Planner\u2019s output is a valid JSON object that contains all the required keys. The reward is 1 if the format is completely correct, and 0 otherwise. Filtering Success Reward ( R f \u200b i \u200b l \u200b t \u200b e \u200b r \u200b i \u200b n \u200b g \u200b _ \u200b s \u200b u \u200b c \u200b c \u200b e \u200b s \u200b s R_{filtering\\_success} ) : This reward is calculated only if R f \u200b m \u200b t = 1 R_{fmt}=1 . The system executes the filtering operation and checks if the ground-truth target element appears in the top-20 list of pruned candidates. The reward is 1 if it is present, and 0 otherwise. Grounding Success Reward ( R g \u200b r \u200b o \u200b u \u200b n \u200b d \u200b i \u200b n \u200b g \u200b _ \u200b s \u200b u \u200b c \u200b c \u200b e \u200b s \u200b s R_{grounding\\_success} ) : This reward is calculated only if R f \u200b i \u200b l \u200b t \u200b e \u200b r \u200b i \u200b n \u200b g \u200b _ \u200b s \u200b u \u200b c \u200b c \u200b e \u200b s \u200b s = 1 R_{filtering\\_success}=1 . The system proceeds with the grounding operation and checks if the final generated action perfectly matches the ground-truth action (including action type, element, and parameters). The reward is 1 if they match, and 0 otherwise. Considering this step-wise reward mechanism, we ultimately set the weight coefficients \u03b1 \\alpha and \u03b2 \\beta to 1 to ensure the model can optimize its performance stably and progressively.",

            "paragraphs": "All models\u2019 foundational capabilities are initialized through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The goal of SFT is to teach the model to generate outputs that conform to our predefined format and content, based on a given input. This stage provides a good \u201ccold start\u201d model for the subsequent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) phase, allowing it to begin exploration from a reasonable base policy. We explored two SFT training paradigms: separated models and a unified model.\nSeparated Models Paradigm .\nIn the separated models paradigm, we independently trained three specialized models for the framework\u2019s three core components: the Planner, the Programmatic Element Filter, and the Action Grounder. Each model was trained on data specific to its corresponding task, and their respective training objectives and input-output formats are detailed below.\nPlanner Model SFT .\nThe training for the Planner model aims to teach it high-level planning. In training, the model receives input containing the current high-level task description and a webpage screenshot. It is trained to generate a structured string as output. This output string must contain two parts: a thought process enclosed in <think> tags, and a JSON object enclosed in <answer> tags. This JSON object needs to include a detailed analysis of the page state ( state_analysis ), an evaluation of task progress ( progress_evaluation ), challenges ( challenges ), the next low-level sub-task ( next_steps ), the action type ( action_type ), and the target text ( target ).\nProgrammatic Element Filter Model SFT .\nThe training for this model aims to teach it to extract keywords for element localization from the plan. During training, the model receives the complete JSON output from the Planner model as input. Its expected output is also a string containing <think> and <answer> tags. In this output, the JSON object enclosed by the <answer> tag must contain a keyword_weights key, whose value is a dictionary mapping keywords to their weights.\nAction Grounder Model SFT .\nThe training for the Action Grounder model aims to teach it to make the final decision based on the plan and the pruned list of elements. Its input is composed of the task context, the Planner\u2019s output, and the pruned list of DOM candidates. The model\u2019s expected output is also a string containing <think> and <answer> tags, where the JSON object enclosed by the <answer> tag must specify the final action type ( action ), the target element\u2019s ID ( id ), and any necessary input text ( input text ).\nUnified Model with Two-turn Dialogue .\nWe designed the unified model paradigm to explore the trade-offs between two different optimization paths for Web Agent tasks: one path involves decomposing the task and optimizing multiple separated models, while the other utilizes a unified data stream to optimize a single, end-to-end model. This paradigm uses an innovative \u201ctwo-turn dialogue\u201d training template to synergistically optimize all three component functionalities within a single model. First turn : The model\u2019s input consists of the high-level task, history, and a webpage screenshot. Its expected output is a structured string containing a thought process in <think> tags, a low-level sub-task in <plan> tags, and a keyword-weight dictionary in <keywords_weights> tags. Second turn : After the system simulates the filtering operation, the resulting pruned DOM list is provided as input. The model\u2019s expected output is then a JSON object containing the final action, enclosed in <answer> tags.\nData Format Reference .\nThe specific data formats and structures used in all the SFT training paradigms described above can be found in the data example files provided in the code repository accompanying our paper.",

The goal of RFT is to enhance the Planner\u2019s strategic planning capabilities, enabling it to generate low-level sub-tasks that are more conducive to the success of downstream tasks. Therefore, RFT is applied only to the Planner model (in the separated paradigm) or to the first turn of the unified model.\nGRPO Algorithm Implementation .\nWe use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) algorithm for policy optimization. GRPO estimates the relative advantage of each response by comparing the rewards of multiple responses generated from a single prompt, which leads to more stable updates of the policy model. Our implementation is based on the VLM-R1 framework and uses its default hyperparameter configuration.\nThe GRPO algorithm extends policy gradient methods by refining the advantage estimation. A key aspect involves calculating the relative advantage A i A_{i} for the i i -th response in a set of candidate responses O = { o 1 , o 2 , \u2026 , o N } O=\\{o_{1},o_{2},\\ldots,o_{N}\\} generated from a state, given their respective rewards { r 1 , r 2 , \u2026 , r N } \\{r_{1},r_{2},\\ldots,r_{N}\\} .

This data serves as a tabular supplement to Figure 3 in the main paper, allowing readers to look up the precise recall rate for each value of k.\nDetailed Recall@k Performance .\nTable 7 details the Recall@k performance of four different backbone models: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct (Finetuned), and Qwen2.5VL-3B-Instruct (Finetuned), for k values ranging from 1 to 20. The data clearly shows that our fine-tuned models, even the smallest 0.5B version, exhibit extremely high recall rates at small k values (e.g., k \u00a1= 5), exceeding 95%. This finding is particularly important as it demonstrates that our method can place the ground-truth target element at the very top of the candidate list with high precision, thereby significantly reducing the decision-making difficulty for the downstream Action Grounder model.\nTo validate the efficiency of our method and its low dependency on computational resources, we designed an experiment to evaluate the performance when using a smaller-parameter model for the downstream components. Our hypothesis is that because the filtering and grounding tasks are greatly simplified within our framework, a smaller model should be able to maintain a high level of performance.\nExperimental Setup .\nWe created a mixed-parameter model configuration. The Planner continued to use the Qwen2.5VL-3B-Instruct model to ensure planning quality. The downstream Programmatic Element Filter and Action Grounder, however, used our trained Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model. We directly compare the performance of this mixed-model (3B Planner + 0.5B Downstream) with the separated model (Prune4Web-3B, Separated Models) reported in the main paper, which uses the 3B model for all components. The evaluation was conducted on the cross-task test set.\nResults and Analysis .\nTable 8 shows the performance comparison of the two configurations on the three key metrics of the cross-task test set. The experimental results show that the configuration using the 0.5B model for downstream tasks performs very closely to the configuration using the 3B model for all components, with only a very slight drop in performance. This result strongly demonstrates that our method successfully transforms complex perception tasks into simpler generation tasks, making them manageable even for small-parameter models. This highlights the high efficiency and cost-effectiveness of our approach for practical deployment.\nThis experiment aims to demonstrate that our filtering and grounding modules are not exclusively tied to our own Planner. Instead, they can serve as a universal, plug-and-play component to enhance the grounding performance of any existing Web Agent. To this end, we chose the current state-of-the-art GUI Agent model, UI-tars ( qin2025uitars ) , as our integration target and comparison baseline, evaluating its performance on web tasks.\nExperimental Setup .\nWe first evaluated the end-to-end performance of the UI-tars model on the cross-task test set as our baseline. Next, we constructed a hybrid system. We directly parsed the \u2018thought\u2018 generated by UI-tars during its decision-making process and used it as the low-level sub-task input for our pre-trained Programmatic Element Filter and Action Grounder models.

        "title": "Appendix F Case Studies and Discussion",
        "paragraphs": "This section provides detailed case studies to intuitively demonstrate the operational flow of the Prune4Web framework in practical tasks. Based on these cases, we then discuss the limitations of the current method and directions for future work.\nTo provide readers with a more intuitive understanding of the effectiveness of the Prune4Web framework across different task types, we present four success cases. We will first provide a detailed breakdown of an e-commerce task to showcase the complete workflow of the framework, followed by a brief introduction to several other cases to highlight its adaptability in various scenarios.\nDetailed Walkthrough: E-commerce Shopping Task .\nWe use the task \u201cBuy a $100 e-gift card for John on the Underarmour website\u201d as an example to demonstrate the end-to-end execution process of the framework. Planning Stage : After receiving the task and screenshot, the Planner accurately decomposes the task into a series of sub-tasks, such as \u201cfill in the recipient\u2019s email\u201d and \u201cclick to add to bag.\u201d Filtering Stage : In each step, the Programmatic Element Filter generates highly relevant keywords (e.g., \u201crecipient,\u201d \u201cemail\u201d) based on the current sub-task. As shown in Figure 4 , the generated Python scoring program is executed, precisely pruning hundreds of interactive elements on the page down to just a few relevant input fields. Grounding Stage : The Action Grounder makes decisions on a very small set of candidates, easily selecting the correct element and performing the corresponding action, such as entering the email address. This case clearly demonstrates how our programmatic pruning method significantly reduces decision-making difficulty, thereby achieving precise and efficient multi-step form filling.\nCapability Showcase: Information Retrieval on Amazon .\nPrune4Web excels at information retrieval tasks that involve searching and navigating through results. In the task \u201cFind the cost of a 2-year protection for PS4 on Amazon,\u201d the agent must first handle a CAPTCHA, then search for the product, and finally identify the correct information from a list of results. As shown in Figure 5 , the transition from a cluttered search results page to a focused view with only relevant protection plans clearly illustrates the effect of our Programmatic DOM Pruning. A large number of irrelevant elements are filtered out, simplifying the decision process and increasing the precision of the final action.\nCapability Showcase: Handling Dynamic Webpages on GitHub .\nIn tasks like \u201cSign up for a GitHub account,\u201d the page state changes dynamically with user input. Our framework demonstrates good adaptability. As the low-level sub-task generated by the Planner shifts from clicking the initial \u201cSign up\u201d button, to entering an email, and then to continuing, our programmatic pruning dynamically adapts to this shifting focus. As illustrated in Figure 6 , at each distinct step, it precisely filters the webpage to highlight only the relevant interactive elements for the current sub-task, demonstrating the framework\u2019s adaptability in complex, multi-step scenarios.\nCapability Showcase: Navigational Decision-Making on Amtrak .\nUnlike tasks that involve form-filling, many web automation challenges require the agent to make a series of navigational choices by understanding the semantic relevance of various hyperlinks. Figure 7 demonstrates the agent performing such a task: finding the national caf\u00e9 menu on the Amtrak website. At each step, such as on the \u201cOnboard Dining\u201d page, the Prune4Web framework leverages the task\u2019s intent to programmatically prune the options, correctly identifying \u201cCaf\u00e9\u201d as the most relevant link to achieve the goal. This showcases the framework\u2019s effectiveness in handling complex navigational challenges by interpreting the semantic hierarchy of a website.\nAnalysis of failure cases reveals that the ultimate success of a task requires both high-quality Planning and precise Action Grounding. Although our Prune4Web framework performs exceptionally well in the Action Grounding stage, effectively mitigating the problem of inaccurate element localization, a severe deficiency in the upstream Planning stage can still lead to the ultimate failure of the task. We will elaborate on this point with two typical planning failure cases.\nCase 1: Ineffective Exploration Loop on Rottentomatoes .\nIn the task \u201cView all of the Most Popular TV on rottentomatoes,\u201d the agent got stuck in a 25-step ineffective exploration loop and ultimately failed. The root cause of the failure lies in the Planner generating a flawed plan. It failed to identify the correct \u201cView All\u201d or \u201cMost Popular\u201d navigation links on the page, instead incorrectly guiding the agent to cycle through different category filters. This case demonstrates that a flawed plan, even if every step is executed with precision, cannot lead the agent to the final goal.\nCase 2: Incorrect Goal Identification on Carmax .\nIn the task \u201cSearch for a full-time job in sales in Springfield on carmax,\u201d the agent ended up on an incorrect page for an inventory position in Raleigh. The failure again originated from the Planning stage. The Planner failed to correctly associate the core entities \u201csales\u201d and \u201cSpringfield\u201d with the corresponding input fields or filters on the page, instead formulating an incorrect search strategy. Although Prune4Web dynamically adjusted the pruning based on the incorrect intermediate intent at each subsequent step, the entire task was trapped in an irrecoverable failure loop from the very beginning due to the initial planning error.\nCommon Conclusion .\nThese two cases both point to a core conclusion: the precision of the downstream execution modules cannot compensate for the failures of the upstream planning. This once again confirms the critical importance of the planning module in the overall agent architecture.\nAlthough Prune4Web achieved state-of-the-art performance in experiments, the aforementioned failure cases also reveal some limitations of its current implementation and help clarify the core contribution scope of this work. This section will systematically summarize these limitations and propose potential research directions accordingly.\nPrimacy of Planning and Scope of This Work .\nAs the failure cases show, the performance bottleneck of the current framework lies mainly in the Planning stage. The Planner may sometimes produce flawed or non-progressive plans, leading to task failure. Here, we wish to emphasize that the core contribution of the Prune4Web framework and method lies in the optimization of the Action Grounding process . We focus on solving the problem of how to accurately and efficiently localize and execute an action, given a low-level sub-task. The optimization of the planning and decomposition capabilities for high-level tasks, while crucial, is not the primary focus of this paper. Experiments show that for errors in the planning stage, optimization through SFT+RFT with a small amount of data is not significantly effective.\nChallenges in Filtering and Grounding .\nAlthough the current filtering and grounding stages are robust, they still face challenges when encountering non-standard web coding practices. Non-standard HTML structure : When web developers misuse non-semantic tags like <div> to build buttons or links, relying solely on CSS for their appearance and functionality, our method struggles to identify their interactivity due to the lack of explicit HTML tags or role attributes. Lack of semantic features : When a large number of interactive elements lack descriptive text, aria-labels, or other semantic attributes, our keyword matching mechanism becomes difficult. For example, a page might have many buttons with only icons and no text descriptions. Visual and source code inconsistency : Some websites prioritize visual presentation over the standardization of their HTML source code, leading to discrepancies between the text or structure in the source and what the user perceives visually. This can also mislead our filtering and grounding process.\nFuture Work .\nSignificantly improving planning capabilities can be an important direction for future work. This may require larger and more diverse planning training data, or the introduction of more powerful exploration mechanisms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search. To address the challenges in the filtering and grounding stages, future work could explore stronger multimodal fusion methods. For example, combining visual information to understand the functionality of elements defined by CSS, or using layout analysis to infer the actual function of non-semantic <div> tags, could help overcome the challenges posed by non-standard webpages. In summary, these limitations provide clear and valuable directions for future research in the field of web agents.

            "title": "F.1 Success Case Analysis",
            "paragraphs": "To provide readers with a more intuitive understanding of the effectiveness of the Prune4Web framework across different task types, we present four success cases. We will first provide a detailed breakdown of an e-commerce task to showcase the complete workflow of the framework, followed by a brief introduction to several other cases to highlight its adaptability in various scenarios.\nDetailed Walkthrough: E-commerce Shopping Task .\nWe use the task \u201cBuy a $100 e-gift card for John on the Underarmour website\u201d as an example to demonstrate the end-to-end execution process of the framework. Planning Stage : After receiving the task and screenshot, the Planner accurately decomposes the task into a series of sub-tasks, such as \u201cfill in the recipient\u2019s email\u201d and \u201cclick to add to bag.\u201d Filtering Stage : In each step, the Programmatic Element Filter generates highly relevant keywords (e.g., \u201crecipient,\u201d \u201cemail\u201d) based on the current sub-task. As shown in Figure 4 , the generated Python scoring program is executed, precisely pruning hundreds of interactive elements on the page down to just a few relevant input fields. Grounding Stage : The Action Grounder makes decisions on a very small set of candidates, easily selecting the correct element and performing the corresponding action, such as entering the email address. This case clearly demonstrates how our programmatic pruning method significantly reduces decision-making difficulty, thereby achieving precise and efficient multi-step form filling.\nCapability Showcase: Information Retrieval on Amazon .\nPrune4Web excels at information retrieval tasks that involve searching and navigating through results. In the task \u201cFind the cost of a 2-year protection for PS4 on Amazon,\u201d the agent must first handle a CAPTCHA, then search for the product, and finally identify the correct information from a list of results. As shown in Figure 5 , the transition from a cluttered search results page to a focused view with only relevant protection plans clearly illustrates the effect of our Programmatic DOM Pruning. A large number of irrelevant elements are filtered out, simplifying the decision process and increasing the precision of the final action.\nCapability Showcase: Handling Dynamic Webpages on GitHub .\nIn tasks like \u201cSign up for a GitHub account,\u201d the page state changes dynamically with user input. Our framework demonstrates good adaptability. As the low-level sub-task generated by the Planner shifts from clicking the initial \u201cSign up\u201d button, to entering an email, and then to continuing, our programmatic pruning dynamically adapts to this shifting focus. As illustrated in Figure 6 , at each distinct step, it precisely filters the webpage to highlight only the relevant interactive elements for the current sub-task, demonstrating the framework\u2019s adaptability in complex, multi-step scenarios.\nCapability Showcase: Navigational Decision-Making on Amtrak .\nUnlike tasks that involve form-filling, many web automation challenges require the agent to make a series of navigational choices by understanding the semantic relevance of various hyperlinks. Figure 7 demonstrates the agent performing such a task: finding the national caf\u00e9 menu on the Amtrak website. At each step, such as on the \u201cOnboard Dining\u201d page, the Prune4Web framework leverages the task\u2019s intent to programmatically prune the options, correctly identifying \u201cCaf\u00e9\u201d as the most relevant link to achieve the goal. This showcases the framework\u2019s effectiveness in handling complex navigational challenges by interpreting the semantic hierarchy of a website.",

            "title": "F.2 Failure Case Analysis: The Interdependence of Planning and Grounding",
            "paragraphs": "Analysis of failure cases reveals that the ultimate success of a task requires both high-quality Planning and precise Action Grounding. Although our Prune4Web framework performs exceptionally well in the Action Grounding stage, effectively mitigating the problem of inaccurate element localization, a severe deficiency in the upstream Planning stage can still lead to the ultimate failure of the task. We will elaborate on this point with two typical planning failure cases.\nCase 1: Ineffective Exploration Loop on Rottentomatoes .\nIn the task \u201cView all of the Most Popular TV on rottentomatoes,\u201d the agent got stuck in a 25-step ineffective exploration loop and ultimately failed. The root cause of the failure lies in the Planner generating a flawed plan. It failed to identify the correct \u201cView All\u201d or \u201cMost Popular\u201d navigation links on the page, instead incorrectly guiding the agent to cycle through different category filters. This case demonstrates that a flawed plan, even if every step is executed with precision, cannot lead the agent to the final goal.\nCase 2: Incorrect Goal Identification on Carmax .\nIn the task \u201cSearch for a full-time job in sales in Springfield on carmax,\u201d the agent ended up on an incorrect page for an inventory position in Raleigh. The failure again originated from the Planning stage. The Planner failed to correctly associate the core entities \u201csales\u201d and \u201cSpringfield\u201d with the corresponding input fields or filters on the page, instead formulating an incorrect search strategy. Although Prune4Web dynamically adjusted the pruning based on the incorrect intermediate intent at each subsequent step, the entire task was trapped in an irrecoverable failure loop from the very beginning due to the initial planning error.\nCommon Conclusion .\nThese two cases both point to a core conclusion: the precision of the downstream execution modules cannot compensate for the failures of the upstream planning. This once again confirms the critical importance of the planning module in the overall agent architecture.",

            "title": "F.3 Limitations and Future Work",
            "paragraphs": "Although Prune4Web achieved state-of-the-art performance in experiments, the aforementioned failure cases also reveal some limitations of its current implementation and help clarify the core contribution scope of this work. This section will systematically summarize these limitations and propose potential research directions accordingly.\nPrimacy of Planning and Scope of This Work .\nAs the failure cases show, the performance bottleneck of the current framework lies mainly in the Planning stage. The Planner may sometimes produce flawed or non-progressive plans, leading to task failure. Here, we wish to emphasize that the core contribution of the Prune4Web framework and method lies in the optimization of the Action Grounding process . We focus on solving the problem of how to accurately and efficiently localize and execute an action, given a low-level sub-task. The optimization of the planning and decomposition capabilities for high-level tasks, while crucial, is not the primary focus of this paper. Experiments show that for errors in the planning stage, optimization through SFT+RFT with a small amount of data is not significantly effective.\nChallenges in Filtering and Grounding .\nAlthough the current filtering and grounding stages are robust, they still face challenges when encountering non-standard web coding practices. Non-standard HTML structure : When web developers misuse non-semantic tags like <div> to build buttons or links, relying solely on CSS for their appearance and functionality, our method struggles to identify their interactivity due to the lack of explicit HTML tags or role attributes. Lack of semantic features : When a large number of interactive elements lack descriptive text, aria-labels, or other semantic attributes, our keyword matching mechanism becomes difficult. For example, a page might have many buttons with only icons and no text descriptions. Visual and source code inconsistency : Some websites prioritize visual presentation over the standardization of their HTML source code, leading to discrepancies between the text or structure in the source and what the user perceives visually. This can also mislead our filtering and grounding process.\nFuture Work .\nSignificantly improving planning capabilities can be an important direction for future work. This may require larger and more diverse planning training data, or the introduction of more powerful exploration mechanisms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search. To address the challenges in the filtering and grounding stages, future work could explore stronger multimodal fusion methods. For example, combining visual information to understand the functionality of elements defined by CSS, or using layout analysis to infer the actual function of non-semantic <div> tags, could help overcome the challenges posed by non-standard webpages. In summary, these limitations provide clear and valuable directions for future research in the field of web agents. We believe that a robust Web Agent requires the synergistic development of both planning and grounding capabilities.",

        "These agents achieve this by interpreting high-level tasks, breaking them down into low-level sub-tasks, and seamlessly interacting with web elements.",
        "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in autonomous web navigation through their strong reasoning and decision-making abilities ( yao2022webshop ; deng2023mind2web ) .",
        "Current web agents approaches fall into three main categories: 1) Textual HTML/DOM-based ( yao2022webshop ; song2024beyond ) , 2) Visual Screenshot-based ( lin2024showui ; cheng2024seeclick ) , and 3) Multi-modal-based ( he2024webvoyager ; zheng2024gpt ) .",
        "Visual screenshots provide an intuitive, human-like understanding of webpage state, making them effective for reasoning about low-level sub-tasks.",
        "However, they contain limited semantic information, especially for special icons, and are sensitive to variations in resolution and overlapping elements.",
        "In contrast, HTML/DOMs offer precise and stable semantic and structural information that enables accurate element selection with minimal ambiguity.",
        "In this paper, we leverage the complementary advantages of text and visual multi-modal information and design a multi-stage framework: A planner model takes the high-level task (e.g., \u201cBook a flight to New York\u201d) and a screenshot , then decomposes it into a low-level sub-task (e.g., \u201cFind the destination field and Type NYC\u201d).",
        "Based on the sub-task, an action grounder model processes the DOMs to precisely localize and execute the required operations (e.g., selecting <input id=\u201cdestination\u201d>to type \u201cNYC\u201d).",
        "However, modern webpage DOMs typically contain 10,000\u2013100,000 tokens\u2014far exceeding the context capacity of most LLMs.",
        "This results in token truncation and attention dilution, leading to critical information loss and significant processing delays ( gou2024navigating ; deng2023mind2web ) .",
        "Existing HTML pruning methods fall short, either relying on overly simplistic heuristic filtering ( he2024webvoyager ; pan2024webcanvas ) or requiring separate language models for element-ranking ( deng2023mind2web ) .",
        "Neither approach effectively addresses the core issue.",
        "The fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently and accurately navigate task-relevant elements from complete DOM structures.",
        "To this end, we propose a Prune4Web pipeline through a novel paradigm: DOM Tree Pruning Programming.",
        "We observe that the low-level sub-tasks (e.g.,\u201cFind the destination field\u201d) output by the planner contain extensive semantic clues about potentially relevant DOM elements.",
        "This insight motivates us to shift the LLM\u2019s role from directly locating elements in lengthy DOMs to generating a locator program based solely on the low-level sub-tasks, thereby avoiding the need to feed long DOM sources into the LLMs ( jiang2024survey ; zhang2023planning ) .",
        "Specifically, we implement this concept through our Programmatic Element Filter model.",
        "This filter receives a specific low-level sub-task from the upstream Planner and prompts the LLM to generate a concise, task-specific Python scoring program .",
        "We design a heuristic-based scoring program template, requiring the LLM to generate only key parameters for better controllability and flexibility.",
        "The generated program runs independently outside the LLM, efficiently traversing the complete DOM tree to score and rank all elements.",

        "In the agent field, programmatic thinking typically generates high-level action sequences that control agent behavior on the web ( ma2023laser ) , mobile devices ( wen2024autodroid ; zhang2023appagent ) , or general computer operations ( zhang2024ufo ; tan2024cradle ; wu2024copilot ; xie2025osworld ) .",
        "Our work innovatively applies this paradigm to the lower-level problem of DOM filtering by generating an executable scoring function that actively reshapes the model\u2019s input.",
        "Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Agents.",
        "To enable agents to learn complex policies beyond static datasets, Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is increasingly used to optimize LLM agents for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments ( lu2025uir1 ; qi2024webrl ; bai2025digirl ; guo2025deepseek ) .",
        "RFT allows agents to learn from outcomes via a reward mechanism, enabling them to master complex strategies.",
        "In Prune4Web, we not only employ RFT to optimize the Planner\u2019s capabilities but also innovatively use the success or failure of our DTPP process to provide rich intermediate reward signals ( zhou2025roborefer ) , facilitating more efficient policy learning.",
        "We introduce Prune4Web, a multi-stage framework for complex web automation tasks.",
        "The complete workflow is shown in Figure 2 .",
        "The framework consists of three stages: task planning, element filtering, and action grounding.",
        "Planning Stage.",
        "The workflow begins with the Planner model, which decomposes a high-level task T T into low-level sub-tasks S t S_{t} based on the current webpage screenshot S \u200b c t Sc_{t} and operational history H t H_{t} .",
        "This process is formally expressed as: S t = Planner \u200b ( T , S \u200b c t , H t ) S_{t}=\\text{Planner}(T,Sc_{t},H_{t}) .",
        "For example, given the high-level task \u201cBook a flight to New York,\u201d the Planner might generate low-level sub-tasks like \u201cFind the destination field\u201d and \u201cType NYC\u201d, as well as current states.",
        "The Planner intentionally does not access the HTML source code, keeping its focus on high-level strategic decomposition.",
        "Filtering Stage.",
        "If a low-level sub-task S t S_{t} requires interaction with a specific element, the workflow proceeds to the filtering stage managed by the Programmatic Element Filter model.",
        "This model implements our core method, DOM Tree Pruning Programming, to generate a refined list of candidate elements C t C_{t} from the complete HTML source code: C t = ProgrammaticElementFilter \u200b ( S t , HTML t ) C_{t}=\\text{ProgrammaticElementFilter}(S_{t},\\text{HTML}_{t}) .",
        "The resulting list C t C_{t} then serves as the sole input for the subsequent Action Grounder.",
        "Action Grounding Stage.",
        "The Action Grounder completes the workflow by generating the final executable action A t A_{t} .",
        "It takes two inputs: the low-level sub-task S t S_{t} from the Planner and the pruned candidate list C t C_{t} from the Programmatic Element Filter.",
        "This is formally expressed as A t = ActionGrounder \u200b ( S t , [ C t ] ) A_{t}=\\text{ActionGrounder}(S_{t},[C_{t}]) , where the brackets indicate that [ C t ] [C_{t}] is conditional.",
        "This is because [ C t ] [C_{t}] is only required for element-specific actions (e.g., \u2018click\u2019), whereas abstract actions (e.g., \u2018task complete\u2019) are grounded directly from S t S_{t} .",
        "In summary, the Prune4Web framework offers a dual advantage.",
        "It uses the structured, precise information from the DOM to avoid the pitfalls of visual-based localization in complex scenarios.",
        "At the same time, its innovative filtering stage distills verbose HTML into a concise list of candidates.",
        "This effectively mitigates information overload and significantly reduces the difficulty and error rate of the grounding task for the Action Grounder.",
        "DOM Tree Pruning Programming is the technical core of Prune4Web.",
        "It offloads the heavy task of element filtering from the LLM itself to a lightweight, dynamically generated program.",
        "Step 1: Initial Rule-based Filtering.",
        "The process begins with a rule-based preliminary filtering of the raw HTML t \\text{HTML}_{t} .",
        "The core principle is to retain elements with clear interactive features based on their tags (e.g., <a>, <button>, <input>) or \u2018role\u2019 attributes (e.g., \u2018checkbox\u2019).",
        "For non-interactive elements, we extract key textual information (from \u2018text\u2019, \u2018aria-label\u2019, etc.)",
        "and attach it to the nearest interactive element as supplementary context.",
        "This step yields a pre-processed DOM tree containing only context-enriched interactive elements, serving as a more structured and less noisy initial candidate set.",
        "Step 2: Scoring Function Generation.",
        "The core task of the Programmatic Element Filter is to generate a Python scoring function f s \u200b c \u200b o \u200b r \u200b e \u200b _ \u200b t f_{score\\_t} for the current step.",
        "We design a heuristic-based Scoring Function Template, where the LLM only needs to generate key parameters for this template.",
        "This approach significantly improves the stability and controllability of the generated code while maintaining flexibility.",
        "Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo-code of the template.",
        "The template mimics human intuition when searching for elements using keywords.",
        "It assumes that a target element contains identifiable textual features within the HTML.",
        "The template performs tiered, weighted matching across different attributes: Tier 1 includes visible \u2018text\u2019; Tier 2 includes non-visible but high-semantic attributes like \u2018aria-label\u2019 and \u2018placeholder\u2019; and Tier 3 includes other attributes like \u2018class\u2019 or \u2018id\u2019 that may contain semantic cues.",
        "The template also integrates multiple matching types (e.g., exact, substring, fuzzy) and assigns weights based on match quality.",
        "With this design, the Programmatic Element Filter simply generates a set of keywords and their corresponding base weights based on the low-level sub-task S t S_{t} , enabling multi-faceted relevance scoring for each element.",
        "Step 3: Pruning Execution and Output Formatting.",
        "The generated scoring function f s \u200b c \u200b o \u200b r \u200b e \u200b _ \u200b t f_{score\\_t} is immediately executed to compute a score s s for each element e e in the pre-processed DOM tree.",
        "The system then selects the Top-N highest-scoring elements, where N defaults to 20.",
        "The impact of varying N from 1 to 20 on pruning efficiency is visualized and analyzed in the Experiments section.",
        "Discussion.",
        "The primary advantage of DOM Tree Pruning Programming lies in its combination of flexibility and structure.",
        "The LLM provides high-level, context-aware intelligence by generating keywords and weights, while the hard-coded function template ensures robust, efficient, and interpretable scoring and execution.",
        "By generating a lightweight function instead of directly processing lengthy raw HTML, this paradigm avoids attention dilution from long contexts and significantly reduces inference latency.",
        "To effectively train our multi-stage architecture and rigorously evaluate DOM Tree Pruning Programming, we reconstructed and re-annotated the public Multimodal-Mind2Web (MM2W) dataset ( deng2023mind2web ) .",
        "The original MM2W dataset contains only high-level tasks, per-step source code, and final target elements and actions, lacking the intermediate reasoning steps our framework requires.",
        "To address this, we used GPT-4o ( hurst2024gpt ) as an annotation tool to add rich intermediate labels for each step.",
        "These labels include: (1) low-level sub-tasks for the Planner; (2) keywords and their weights for the Programmatic Element Filter; and (3) pruned DOM trees and thought processes for the Action Grounder.",
        "After annotation, we performed secondary cleaning and manual verification to ensure high data quality while strictly adhering to MM2W\u2019s original train/test splits.",

        "This section further clarifies the strong dependencies between these stages.",
        "The output of the Planning stage directly determines the goal for the Filtering stage.",
        "Correspondingly, the quality of the Filtering stage critically impacts the success of the Action Grounding stage.",

        "Specifically, the LLM no longer parses the DOM directly.",

        "Visibility and Hierarchy Judgment .",
        "In addition to interactivity, the script uses helper functions like isElementVisible and isTopElement to filter out elements that are invisible or obscured by other elements.",
        "This series of preprocessing steps ensures that the elements ultimately scored are those the user can currently see and interact with.",
        "It thus transforms a large, complex live DOM into a structured, pre-filtered, and smaller-scale JSON object, laying the foundation for efficient subsequent scoring.",
        "Scoring Function Template .",
        "The core of our method is a fixed, heuristic-based Python scoring function, the full implementation of which is provided in the supplementary code.",
        "Under this design, the LLM\u2019s task is significantly simplified.",
        "It only needs to generate a Python dictionary named keyword_weights, where the keys are keyword strings and the values are their corresponding base weights, which are integers ranging from 1 to 50.",

        "In the task \u201cView all of the Most Popular TV on rottentomatoes,\u201d the agent got stuck in a 25-step ineffective exploration loop and ultimately failed.",
        "The root cause of the failure lies in the Planner generating a flawed plan.",
        "It failed to identify the correct \u201cView All\u201d or \u201cMost Popular\u201d navigation links on the page, instead incorrectly guiding the agent to cycle through different category filters.",
        "This case demonstrates that a flawed plan, even if every step is executed with precision, cannot lead the agent to the final goal.",
        "Case 2: Incorrect Goal Identification on Carmax .",
        "In the task \u201cSearch for a full-time job in sales in Springfield on carmax,\u201d the agent ended up on an incorrect page for an inventory position in Raleigh.",
        "The failure again originated from the Planning stage.",
        "The Planner failed to correctly associate the core entities \u201csales\u201d and \u201cSpringfield\u201d with the corresponding input fields or filters on the page, instead formulating an incorrect search strategy.",
        "Although Prune4Web dynamically adjusted the pruning based on the incorrect intermediate intent at each subsequent step, the entire task was trapped in an irrecoverable failure loop from the very beginning due to the initial planning error.",
        "Common Conclusion .",
        "These two cases both point to a core conclusion: the precision of the downstream execution modules cannot compensate for the failures of the upstream planning.",
        "This once again confirms the critical importance of the planning module in the overall agent architecture.",
        "Although Prune4Web achieved state-of-the-art performance in experiments, the aforementioned failure cases also reveal some limitations of its current implementation and help clarify the core contribution scope of this work.",
        "This section will systematically summarize these limitations and propose potential research directions accordingly.",
        "Primacy of Planning and Scope of This Work .",
        "As the failure cases show, the performance bottleneck of the current framework lies mainly in the Planning stage.",
        "The Planner may sometimes produce flawed or non-progressive plans, leading to task failure.",
        "Here, we wish to emphasize that the core contribution of the Prune4Web framework and method lies in the optimization of the Action Grounding process .",
        "We focus on solving the problem of how to accurately and efficiently localize and execute an action, given a low-level sub-task.",
        "The optimization of the planning and decomposition capabilities for high-level tasks, while crucial, is not the primary focus of this paper.",
        "Experiments show that for errors in the planning stage, optimization through SFT+RFT with a small amount of data is not significantly effective.",
        "Challenges in Filtering and Grounding .",
        "Although the current filtering and grounding stages are robust, they still face challenges when encountering non-standard web coding practices.",
        "Non-standard HTML structure : When web developers misuse non-semantic tags like <div> to build buttons or links, relying solely on CSS for their appearance and functionality, our method struggles to identify their interactivity due to the lack of explicit HTML tags or role attributes.",
        "Lack of semantic features : When a large number of interactive elements lack descriptive text, aria-labels, or other semantic attributes, our keyword matching mechanism becomes difficult.",
        "For example, a page might have many buttons with only icons and no text descriptions.",
        "Visual and source code inconsistency : Some websites prioritize visual presentation over the standardization of their HTML source code, leading to discrepancies between the text or structure in the source and what the user perceives visually.",
        "This can also mislead our filtering and grounding process.",
        "Future Work .",
        "Significantly improving planning capabilities can be an important direction for future work.",
        "This may require larger and more diverse planning training data, or the introduction of more powerful exploration mechanisms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search.",
        "To address the challenges in the filtering and grounding stages, future work could explore stronger multimodal fusion methods.",
        "For example, combining visual information to understand the functionality of elements defined by CSS, or using layout analysis to infer the actual function of non-semantic <div> tags, could help overcome the challenges posed by non-standard webpages.",
        "In summary, these limitations provide clear and valuable directions for future research in the field of web agents.",
        "We believe that a robust Web Agent requires the synergistic development of both planning and grounding capabilities."

These agents achieve this by interpreting high-level tasks, breaking them down into low-level sub-tasks, and seamlessly interacting with web elements. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in autonomous web navigation through their strong reasoning and decision-making abilities ( yao2022webshop ; deng2023mind2web ) . Current web agents approaches fall into three main categories: 1) Textual HTML/DOM-based ( yao2022webshop ; song2024beyond ) , 2) Visual Screenshot-based ( lin2024showui ; cheng2024seeclick ) , and 3) Multi-modal-based ( he2024webvoyager ; zheng2024gpt ) . Visual screenshots provide an intuitive, human-like understanding of webpage state, making them effective for reasoning about low-level sub-tasks.",

These agents achieve this by interpreting high-level tasks, breaking them down into low-level sub-tasks, and seamlessly interacting with web elements. Multimodal-based Web Agents. To achieve higher precision in web interaction, directly processing HTML source code has recently become a significant research direction for LLM-based agents ( lai2024autowebglm ; song2024beyond ) , leading to notable advancements. We introduce Prune4Web, a multi-stage framework for complex web automation tasks. The complete workflow is shown in Figure 2 . Benchmarks, Datasets, and Metrics. We conduct our primary offline evaluation on the standard Multimodal-Mind2Web benchmark ( deng2023mind2web ) , following its official evaluation metrics (Element Accuracy, Operation F1, and Step Success Rate). This paper addressed the significant challenge of information overload for LLM-based web agents by introducing Prune4Web, a multi-stage architecture based on a Planning \u2192 \\rightarrow Programmatic Filtering \u2192 \\rightarrow Action Grounding workflow and the core method of DOM Tree Pruning Programming . Our key innovation leverages LLMs to generate lightweight, interpretable Python programs that dynamically score and prune DOM elements based on semantic clues from decomposed sub-tasks.
