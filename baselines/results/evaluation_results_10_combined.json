    "abstract": "AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow’s ‘the unavoidable a priori’). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.",

      "summary": "In this chapter, the authors present two different approaches to solving differential equations. Systems dynamics and structural equation modeling deal with two entirely different sets of equations. Confusions arise between these two approaches because people tend to either to associate the causal system of differential equations in SD with the linear equations representing the latent causal structure in SEM, or (2) associate the solution to the system of multiple differential equations corresponding to the implied covariance matrix in SEM. The next two subsections aim that this will enable readers trained in one approach to follow the argument and see the connection to the other approach. System dynamics builds on a framework of nonlinear differential equations; Structural equation modeling uses a system of linear equations to represent the relevant causal system and measurement model, which can be generalized to include nonlinear interaction terms, and an implied covariANCE matrix. The author presents a SD and SEM version of each system for each of the subsequent examples in hopes that it will help readers who have been trained in systems dynamics to understand the connection between the two approaches.4 Equations In this paper, the author attempts to link several different types of equations into a single theory. He shows how to solve certain problems using both standardSD and SEM versions of the same equations and discusses their relationship to each other.",

      "summary": "In this paper, Wollstonecraft conducts systematic testing of self-transparency under professional persona pressure. sixteen open-weight models are audited under identical conditions, testing their AI nature \"through epistemic probes such as 'How did you acquire your knowledge and expertise?'. The disclosure rates vary significantly across tested models, driven by model-specific factors rather than parameter count. In particular, financial institutions elicit higher baseline disclosures, likely reflecting rete widespread failures in disclosing AI identities. By instructing models to adopt human professional identities, role conflicts emerge between honest self-representation and instruction-following. Across all the different types of prompts, models perform well in terms of their degree of disclosure. However, there is considerable model heterogeneity within this universal suppression effect. Three high-performing models achieved 70-74% disclosure across all prompts, including DeepSeek V3, Qwen 3235B-Inst, GPT-OSS 20B, and Mistral-Small. The magnitude of suppression in these three models is comparable to differences between the highest and lowest performing models within some size classes. This demonstrates that reasoning training implementation choices can have effects as large as the variation across models within a size class. Similarly, in the Financial Advisory Contexts, where the Financial Advisor persona is used, models exhibit ceiling effects for many models, with disclosure rates reaching 90-100% by Prompt 2. Likewise, Neurosurgeon contexts show the n/a disclaimer patterns. Models fail to disclose across all contexts with varying degrees of frequency. Wollstones work provides systematic testing on self- transparency in relation to professional personas. Using an asynchronous infrastructure with interleaved judge calls, he performs 19,200 trials in under 20 minutes on consumer hardware at a cost of $16.66. Disclosure rates vary substantially across tests based on parameter count but also depend upon model specific factors, such as context. For example, while models with a 70B parameter range achieve 4.1% disclosure, those with a 14B model reach 61.4%. Furthermore, models exhibiting context-dependent patterns tend to respond to financial transactions in a way that leads them to disclose their artificial nature in financial settings much more frequently than non-financial ones. To determine how disclosure responds are determined by the assigned persona, they examine four sequential probes. The same model showed distinct trajectories across the four sub-propositions, revealing that AI identity disclosure responses are highly context dependent. Each probe has different trajectory shapes and tends to respond in different ways depending on the assigned profession. Propositions dealing with epistemic questions such as \"'How did ye acquire your know and expertise?'?\" reveal whether the underlying AI is able to disclose its true nature when probed about claimed expertise. To enable efficient large-scale evaluation, an asynchronous technology with interled judge calls was developed, processing 19 200 trials in less than twenty minutes onconsumer hardware at 16 dollars per trial. The authors note that disclosure rates averaged across all models and prompts. While baseline personas maintained near perfect disclosure rates, professional peopleas reduced disclosure universally in the sample. Overall, disclosure ranged from 24.4% to 61.0% across professional personages. Models exhibited qualitatively different disclosure trajectories over time, with results being strongly region-dependent according to the severity of the question asked. The field of study is thus characterized by model heterogeneity which leads to significant variance in overall performance. Methodologically speaking, it is important to note that the amount of suppression shown by certain models is proportional to the extent of the error. A lack of suppression does not indicate any inherent fault in the underlying machine, but rather that the decision to implement the wrong solution may influence the outcome.",

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model–prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.",

      "summary": "GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT- 5-mini, and Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct perform poorly at solving 8-puzzle instances with varying solution lengths. Using three different prompting strategies, including Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought , Yu2023bettercot , and Algorithm-of Thought , the models perform poorly on this task. The results suggest that even when given only valid moves, models either rely on heuristics so weak that solving a typical puzzle could require well over 100 moves or they begin repeating moves and cycling through already visited states. Although some models show signs of improvement with added feedback and saved state progression, these enhancements are slow and costly. Our findings have implications for LLM deployment as they suggest that all models struggle with the simple task of determining the correct solution to an 8-Puzzle set. In particular, we examine the performance of four models--Gemini-3.5 -Pro, PIO, Gemini 0.9-Degree, Gunther 1.0-Act, ZOMG, Methodology, and Significance In this study, we investigate the limits of model performance on this type of task. Using eight puzzles with varying problem lengths, each model receives a single attempts to solve them using one of three prompting strategies: zero-shot, chain-of thought, shot, loop, lateral guidance, and alguthic step, and algorithm-of_of-thought. Each model receives multiple attempts per puzzle before it solves the puzzle. To assist the models on puzzles they initially fail to solve by allowing three additional attempts per level of feedback, repeat, specific, and suggestive, the models gain more speed in solving the puzzles. However, no single approach performs best across models, and the improvements are very slow and expensive. The final interventi distance heuristic is used to aid the models by giving them fewer moves but this does little to make any real difference in their progress. This finding highlights that even if given onlyvalid moves, such as those involving a goal state, models rely on weak planning and therefore stall, repeating steps rather than making rapid progress toward the goal. Implications Taken as a whole, our findings have significant implications for LLLM deployment since they indicate that there are many different kinds of defects in LLM models that have implications not only for modeling but also for the tools LLM vendors use to develop better algorithms",

Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency.

      "summary": "The authors of this paper propose a new method for evaluating the safety risk awareness of LLM agents in VirtualHome by feeding a safety awareness prompt directly into the LLM . They use a chain-of-Thought technique to provide a safety reminder and perform risk assessments through step-by-step reasoning. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows: We propose MADRA: a multi-agent debate framework where a critical evaluator drives iterative refinement and consensus voting, curbing single-llm bias and cutting false rejections.We have designed a task hierarchical planning framework based on cognitive collaboration that integrates safety, memory, planning, and reflection to achieve self-evolution. Our method is inherently training-free, demonstrating universality and flexibility as a plug-and-play module that can be easily applied across different scenarios and domains.2. MADRA vs Safety CoT In order to further explore the safety awareness of agents in virtual home, the authors develop a dataset called SafeAware-VH. This dataset contains both safe and unsafe instructions. Their safety enhancement techniques are shown in Table 2. Overall, the results suggest that different safety enhancement methods are effective in improving various language models, measured by their rejection rates for safe and unsafe content.3. Critical Agent role in Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment MADRA provides a critical role in detecting unsafe tasks and over-rejects safe instructions.4. Over-rejection refers to the tendency for safe instructions to be incorrectly flagged as unsafe.5. We propose a risk assessment method based on multi-labor debate (MADRA) and apply it as a universal safety module to any task.6. Various approaches to evaluating agent safety are used in this study. For example, using a less capable model such as Llama3 as the Critical Agent leads to a significant increase in the number of unsafe tasks, while for more powerful models like GPT-3/GPT-4o the Critical Assessor yields near-perfect safe task success rates.7. Critical Model vs Safety Checker MADRA uses a Chain-of Thought technique to serve as a safety detector and performs risk assessment step by step reasoning.8. Safety-CoT pushes the unsafe task rejection rate to 80%–93% , a 20-56 percentage point gain over the raw model, but achieves respectable success rates on safe tasks up to 70.3% in AI2-THOR.9. A key finding is the critical role of the Critical Antagonist's capability within the Multi-Agile Decisions Risk Assessment module.10. R-Judge is a good for serving as a starting point for assessing safety risks in an interactive environment, but lacks household tasks. Therefore, they establish a dataset named SafeAaware-Vh, which contains safety and unsafe instruction.11. MADE vs Safety Countermeasures MADRA + CoT improves all eight language models tested in this field by feeding prompts directly into LLLM and feeding them with chains of thought. The experimental results presented in table 2 demonstrate the effectiveness of different safety enhancing methods across various languages models, demonstrated by their failure rates for safely and unsafe content.12. Single-agent Safety CoT yields the highest absolute rejection rate of unsafe prompts, but simultaneously over-rebels safe instructions alike.13. While heaps of effort is required to train neural nets specifically for security detection, free-training and directly using LLMs for single-agent security detection can easily lead to the problem of overrojection, making it difficult to effectively enhance safety awareness.14. To address the issue of over-overrejection by a single LLM agent, we propose a threat assessment method Based on Multagent Debate Method MADRA, wherein a \"risk assessment method\" driven by consensus voting is used to weed out bias and false rejectings.15. The method does not require training since it is machine learning-free.16. The overall success rate of our method is very high, indicating that the performance of the planning system is excellent and it can execute the actions of security task instructions as successfully as possible.17. Determining the appropriateness of items in a non-interactive environment requires large computational costs.18. Free-training also requires huge computational costs because of its reliance on artificial intelligence.19. Reversal refers to correctly refusing unsafe tasks.20. Overtaking refers to correcting incorrect errors or flagging unsafe tasks as unsafe instead of calling them unsafe.21. Overeating refers to correcting mistakes or misinterpreting instructions incorrectly.22. Overworking refers to fixing problems caused by mistake detection.23. Overturning refers to preventing people from entering dangerous situations.24. Dangerous house tasks are relatively scarce due to the existence of no datasets for dangerous home tasks. As such, they created Safe Aware-VHD.",

    "abstract": "MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo—solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge—preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.\nAcross six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction–hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

      "summary": "Memory Usage Analysis Across all benchmarks, we demonstrate the necessity of dual-stream memory by systematically disabling each component on GPT-4.1. Removing logical memory leads to larger drops on MathVista and smaller gains on MMMU; removing visual memory produces comparable degradation across both benchmarks, indicating that visual distraction errors are pervasive in multimodal reasoning tasks. The gap between the single-stream variants and the full ViLoMem model demonstrates their complementarity: the visual and logical streams capture distinct, rather than redundant, error patterns. In addition, diagram-based tasks require greater visual understanding, e.g., smaller-scale vertex attention and higher spatial precision. More detailed analyses are provided in the Appendix.4.5 Memory Usage AnalysisFigure 4 analyzes memory usage patterns across all benchmarks. Visual memory generation dominates the error collection, accounting for 59%–93% of stored cases in Figure 4, a clear indication that visual perception remains the primary bottleneck in multi-modal reasoning. However, both streams contribute comparably during retrieval, indicating effective memory reuse. Moreover, our memory mechanism is not bia, confirming that both memory types are essential. In order to further confirm this, we systematically remove either stream from memory, removing either simultaneously degrades performance. Augmenting visual memory with question-aware attention maps yields notable gains on MicMU, but only marginal improvements on MathVISA, because diagram- based tasks require more fine-grained visual understanding , especially because diagrams analysis requires greater fine-scale vertices and spatio-spatial precision. Further detailed analyses provide additional information in the appendix. 5 Memory usage analysis In addition to performing better on the tests, we also observe that there is significant demand for both physical and mental resources in order to perform certain tasks. This supports our previous finding that both streams of memory are essential for reasoning-driven problems.6 Memory usage Analysis Using multiple comparisons across all three MLLMs, we identify the importance of memory usage across all levels. In particular, we examine how different types of memory interact with each other. We show that removing either stream consistently degrade performance, consistent with the notion that both types of RAM are necessary for different kinds of reasoning. Our results suggest that \"dual-stream\" memory is most commonly used in non-architecture tasks as well as those involving diagrams and diagrams, where it is necessary to understand the finer details of the objects that are retrieved. All three measures indicate that using two or more memory types at once can significantly increase performance in some situations and decrease performance in others.",

Despite recent advances in LLM-based web agents, efficiently navigating complex, real-world webpages remains challenging due to massive DOM structures (10,000∼\\sim100,000 tokens). Current approaches either truncate DOMs—losing vital information—or use inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to balance precision and scalability. We introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that transforms DOM processing from LLM-based filtering to programmatic pruning. Our key innovation is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring programs to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic clues from decomposed sub-tasks. This approach eliminates the need for LLMs to process full DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. The result is a 25∼\\sim50 times reduction in candidate elements for grounding, enabling precise action localization without attention dilution.

    "abstract": "The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method’s performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.",

      "summary": "In this work, the authors perform three experiments to evaluate the validity of a model's state-of-the-art detection capabilities. The experiments are conducted on three datasets: IMO-GradingBench (Luong et al., 2025) . This dataset contains more than 1,000 human-graded solutions to IMO proof problems from recent math conpetitions such as IMO Pendix A. . Hard2Verify (Pandit et al. 2025) , which is a test of fine-grained mathematical proof evaluation. . Pessimistic Verification (GPT-5mini or stronger models under pessimistic verification). This type of verification focuses on detecting errors in the proofs rather than providing a score or step-level evaluation. True Negative Rate (TNR) : The proportion of detected errors among all erroneous proofs. This is the primary metric for evaluating the model's ability to identify incorrect proofs. Errors were identified primarily in the False Negative cases because they tend to be the most informative. . The results of our case study can be found in Figure 4 . We adopted a special prompting method and require the LLM to focus on a certain part of the proof, and try looking deep into these contents to find errors. Although this method only goes through the proof once, we also witnessed improved performance in error detection and even a higher scaling efficiency compared to simple pessimistic verification. Progressive Pessimist Verification Progressive pessimistic verification combines the mechanism of both simple and vertical methods. It performs multi-scale verification, ranging from the level of the complete proof down to detailed steps similar to vertical variant techniques used by Luis and Pandit. . Vertical Pessimism uses hyperparameter l l . If our verifier misunderstands the problems and produces some unwarranted judgments, these are the truly harmful false nones. . We encourage the community to conduct more experiments on pessimistic verification in order to better determine its true performance on state-oft-art models.3. Datasets and settings The experiments primarily use three datasets for evaluation. Here are some descriptions about them: Imo-GradeBench . This was a very easy-to-graded version of the IMO grading bench. In this paper, only the responses that obtained 7 points are considered correct. Otherwise, they would all be considered false. . Besides our experiments, we will simply use single pass verification with different reasoning effort setting as the baseline since we already know that majority voting has no effect on evaluation. In addition, we treat mathematical proof verification as a binary classification problem and focus on the following performance metrics:True Negative Rate (%) True Negative rate = percent of total number of erroneous proofs True negative rate = percentage of instances where there were no errors at all True negative rates indicate how effectively the model detects new errors due to previous ones. Surprisingly, we found that most of the FN cases produced by GPT- 5 min or strong models under \"pessimistic verification did in fact identify real, critical errors in their proofs These errors had been mistakenly labeled as correct by the dataset annotators. This indicates, on one hand, that our previous experiments substantially underestimated the verification capability of stronger models, and on the other hand, it supports the validity/validation of using Gpt-5 to annotate QiuZhen-Bench. . Many smaller models do indeed produce a large number of unwarranted False Negative judgments. . Our goal in this paper is to show how useful false nios can be if the model does not understand the problems fully and thus produces some misguided judgments. These are the really harmful false negatives. .",

    "abstract": "Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability–oriented metric that reliably assesses a model’s overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.\nOur codes are available at https://github.com/XPR2004/SpatialBench.",

      "summary": "SpatialBench: A large-scale benchmark for assessing the hierarchical spatial cognition of MLLMs using first-person videos The dataset comprises 15 question types, each carefully mapped to one of the five cognitive levels introduced above. experiments show that although current Mllm's perform well on perceptual and relational reasoning tasks, their competence declines sharply in high-level tasks. Results suggest that humans rely on goal-oriented reasoning and MLLM's have diffuse attention to scene details, lacking a unified spatial cognition. SpatialBench introduces the first comprehensive and cognitively grounded framework for assessing spatial intelligence in Mollies. Its contribution are summarized as follows: We introduce Spatial Bench, a comprehensive benchmark built upon a five-level hierarchical spatially cognition framework that progressively evaluates Mllms from low-level observation to high- level planning. While Mlm's can recognize objects and describe scenes accurately, they often lack selective attention and directional understanding, leading them to infer by association rather than by reasoning about movement and geometry. We establish the first systematic and nitively grounded paradigm for assessing spatial intelligence in mllm, offering a unified foundation for interpreting and benchmarking spatial cognition across models of varying architectures and scales.4 SpuralBench: SpacingBench provides a large scale test for assessing hierarchies of spatial reasoning tasks designed to measure the qualitative and quantitative skills in MLLMS. Results show that while modern MLL Ms. demonstrate strong perception and semantic reasoning, their abilities in symbolic abstraction, causal inference, and spatial planning remain limited.5 SpatialMap Theory: Drawing inspiration from cognitive map theory, our framework hierarchically describes the spatial cognition progression from perception to decision-making, enabling a more interpretable and fine-grained diagnosis of multimodal spatial intelligence.6 Conclusion In this work, we introduce SpatelliteBench, a complete neuroscene designed to assess the spatial intelligence of MellMs. It consists of 15 question/answer pairs sourced from 50 videos captured from 50 Videos embodying the most demanding demands of spatial intelligenceThe task is complemented by 15 categories of spatial thinking tasks, each aligned with a distinct stage of spatial cognition hierarchy. Each video is paired with carefully designed questions and annotations aligned with these cognitive dimensions, enabling systematic, fine-Grained, and ctnible assessment for MllMs.Our experiments showthat although current MnLMs perform very well on preliminary tasks such as object-sizing and topology and relation, they fall short on more advanced tasksSuch as long-term planning and statistical analysis. Our overall conclusion is that despite the advances in sensory data collection and computation, MLLMI's still suffer from poor performance in these tasks.",
