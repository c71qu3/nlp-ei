      "writers tend to use positive words more frequently than men, \n",
      "whereas there are no differences between the sexes in the use \n",
      "of negative words. This finding is once again in line with the \n",
      "attribution of stereotypical roles to females. For instance, \n",
      "women refer to positive emotions more often than men in \n",
      "conversations and writings (Feng & Ivanov, 2022; Thelwall \n",
      "et al., 2010), and positive emotions are cross-culturally con-\n",
      "sidered more desirable for females than for males (Diener & \n",
      "Lucas, 2004). Nevertheless, as for the frequency of emotion-\n",
      "ally laden terms, sex differences in valence have diminished \n",
      "as a function of societal progress worldwide, reaching com-\n",
      "parable scores in the last decade. Also, different from what \n",
      "stereotypes prescribe, whether male or female authors write \n",
      "more positively laden books varies across cultures. There-\n",
      "fore, sociocultural factors not only influence the extent to \n",
      "which men and women write about emotion but the affective \n",
      "content of their books as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, we observe that male writings are higher in \n",
      "arousal as compared to female books, a difference that is \n",
      "common to all the explored cultures and stable over time. \n",
      "This evidence is supported by a recent study on gender bias \n",
      "in word embeddings (Caliskan et al., 2022), by males using \n",
      "more frequently than females strong swear words (Güvendir, \n",
      "2015; Mehl & Pennebaker, 2003), and by their preference \n",
      "for emotions higher in arousal, such as fearlessness (Diener \n",
      "& Lucas, 2004) or pride (Brebner, 2003). Moreover, our \n",
      "result dovetails with the prescriptive stereotype that males \n",
      "should  demonstrate  assertiveness  and  competitiveness, \n",
      "while females should be warm, sensitive, and cooperative \n",
      "(Koenig, 2018). Interestingly, Eagly and colleagues (Eagly \n",
      "et al., 2020) have shown that the stereotype of men being \n",
      "more agentic has remained stable in the US culture over the \n",
      "last 70 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, by exploring the relationship between valence \n",
      "and arousal across the sexes, we reveal a significant inter-\n",

      "larger  for  negatively-laden  writings,  this  gap  becomes \n",
      "smaller for positive books. We hypothesize this can be \n",
      "explained  by  the  negative  events  that  men  and  women \n",
      "are more likely to experience in their lifetime, but also \n",
      "by social norms controlling what is appropriate to pub-\n",

      "often the consequence of war and violence (Kessler et al., \n",
