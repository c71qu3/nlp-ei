      "A wealth of literature suggests the existence of sex differences in how emotions are experienced, recognized, expressed, and regulated. However, to what extent these differences result from the put in place of stereotypes and social rules is still a matter of debate. Literature is an essential cultural institution, a transposition of the social life of people but also of their intimate affective experiences, which can serve to address questions of psychological relevance. Here, we created a large corpus of literary fiction enriched by authors’ metadata to measure the extent to which culture influences how men and women write about emotion. Our results show that even though before the twenty-first century and across 116 countries women more than men have written about affect, starting from 2000, this difference has diminished substantially. Also, in the past, women’s narratives were more positively laden and less arousing. While the difference in arousal is ubiquitous and still present nowadays, sex differences in valence vary as a function of culture and have dissolved in recent years. Altogether, these findings suggest that historic evolution is associated with men and women writing similarly about emotions and reveal a sizable impact of culture on the affective characteristics of the lexicon.\n",

      "../data/raw/pdfs/The Ethics and Economics of Middle Class Romance.pdf\n",
      "This article shows the philosophical kinship between Adam Smith and Mary Wollstonecraft on the subject of love. Though the two major 18th century thinkers are not traditionally brought into conversation with each other, Wollstonecraft and Smith share deep moral concerns about the emerging commercial society. As the new middle class continues to grow along with commerce, vanity becomes an ever more common vice among its members. But a vain person is preoccupied with appearance, status, and flattery—things that get in the way of what Smith and Wollstonecraft regard as the deep human connection they variously describe as love, sympathy, and esteem. Commercial society encourages inequality, Smith argues, and Wollstonecraft points out that this inequality is particularly obvious in the relationships between men and women. Men are vain about their wealth, power and status; women about their appearance. Added to this is the fact that most middle class women are both uneducated and encouraged by the conduct literature of their day to be sentimental and irrational. The combined economic and moral considerations of Wollstonecraft and Smith show that there is very little room for love in commercial society as they conceived it.\n",

We find evidence for distinct historical periods of positive and negative moods, underlain by a general decrease in the use of emotion-related words through time. Finally, we show that, in books, American English has become decidedly more ‘‘emotional’’ than British English in the last half-century, as a part of a more general increase of the stylistic divergence between the two variants of English language.\n",

      "../data/raw/pdfs/A Parody of Love: the Narrative Uses of Rape in Popular Romance.pdf\n",
      "Discussions of rape in popular romance have most often centered on how these scenes affect or reflect the lives of romance readers. Detractors of the genre have used its presence to support the notion that romance is a patriarchal and repressive literary form, while defenders have often pointed to the presence of the rape scene as a way for women to explore their sexuality. This paper advances an entirely different reading. It asserts that the presence of rape functions as a parodic parallel to the violence of falling in love. Divided into three types, the rape scene occurs as a result of the way the hero perceives the heroine and appropriates her identity. These types are: the Rape of Mistaken Identity, the Rape of P ossession, and the Rape of Coercion or \"Forced Seduction.\" Each performs a version of the e pistemological and ontological questions that arise from an encounter with the Other.\n",

      "The main theoretical issue dealt with in this study is the reproduction of capitalism through romantic fiction for women. The analytical framework is built upon the concept of hegemony, the material and ideological reproduction of society through a combination of consent and coercion. This study examines this process as it applies to a specific phenomena: Harlequin Enterprises, Romances, and readers. The analysis is based on archival research on Harle quin Enterprises and interviews with company officials. The Harlequin Romances component of the study is based on the content analysis of a random sample of fifty Harlequins. Data on readers are based on company information, readers' letters to Harlequin Enterprises, and interviews with twenty four readers. The study concludes that Harlequin Enterprises and Harlequin Romances are part of the hegemonic reproduction of capitalism. They maintain and legitimate sex role structure, corporate.structure, and class structure, crucial aspects of our society. The study also concludes that women's consumption of Harlequins is best understood as being a part of this same process of hegemony. Their reading is shaped by the structure of their lives, by Harlequin EntBrprises, and by Harlequin Romances. The study suggests that further iii theoretical refinement and empirical research is necessary to explore the possibility that there are various types of readers who interpret and respond to romantic fiction in different ways.\n",

      "Imagine a princess asleep in a castle, waiting for her prince to slay the dragon and rescue her. Tales like the famous Sleeping Beauty clearly divide up gender roles. But what about more modern stories, borne of a generation increasingly aware of social constructs like sexism and racism? Do these stories tend to reinforce gender stereotypes, or counter them? In this paper, we present a technique that combines natural language processing with a crowdsourced lexicon of stereotypes to capture gender biases in ﬁction. We apply this technique across 1.8 billion words of ﬁction from the Wattpad online writing community, investigating gender representation in stories, how male and female characters behave and are described, and how authors’ use of gender stereotypes is associated with the community’s ratings. We ﬁnd that male over-representation and traditional gender stereotypes (e.g., dominant men and submissive women) are common throughout nearly every genre in our corpus. However, only some of these stereotypes, like sexual or violent men, are associated with highly rated stories. Finally, despite women often being the target of negative stereotypes, female authors are equally likely to write such stereotypes as men.\n",

      "../data/raw/pdfs/Reflecting the Male Gaze: Quantifying Female Objectification in 19th and 20th Century Novels.pdf\n",
      "Inspired by the concept of the male gaze (Mulvey, 1975) in literature and media studies, this paper proposes a framework for analyzing gender bias in terms of female objectification—the extent to which a text portrays female individuals as objects of visual pleasure. Our framework measures female objectification along two axes. First, we compute an agency bias score that indicates whether male entities are more likely to appear in the text as grammatical agents than female entities. Next, by analyzing the word embedding space induced by a text (Caliskan et al., 2017), we compute an appearance bias score that indicates whether female entities are more closely associated with appearance-related words than male entities. Applying our framework to 19th and 20th century novels reveals evidence of female objectification in literature: we find that novels written from a male perspective systematically objectify female characters, while novels written from a female perspective do not exhibit statistically significant objectification of any gender.\n",

      "../data/raw/pdfs/Negotiating Femininity: Expressions of Gender and the Policing of Female Hierarchies in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.pdf\n",
      "This thesis explores the diverse expressions of femininity in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice through the application of modern sociological femininity theories, including hegemonic, emphasized, and pariah femininity. By situating these theories within the Regency era, the study reveals the complexities and challenges of essentializing characters. Austen's portrayal of femininity is not one-size-fits-all; instead, each character represents a blend of feminine traits that reflect their social positioning and personal choices. This thesis focuses on femininity in comparison with other women, not with men, and how female characters situate themselves within a female hierarchy through policing of self and others. The Bennet sisters, central to this analysis, portray different combinations of these femininities. Jane Bennet’s demure modesty and emotional restraint align with emphasized femininity, aimed at accommodating male desires, but she is hegemonically placed at the top of Meryton’s female hierarchy. Mary Bennet focuses on self-improvement rather than marriage, marking herself as a feminine other. Lydia Bennet’s behaviors display both emphasized and pariah femininity, paralleling Elizabeth Bennet’s traits. However, Lydia's naive decisions jeopardize her family’s reputation while Elizabeth strategically uses her outspoken nature herself favorably to attract Mr. Darcy. The thesis further analyzes characters such as Georgiana Darcy and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Georgiana enjoys hegemonic feminine status but often defers to male authority figures and does not often actively perpetuate a cycle of female hierarchy policing. Lady Catherine, a high-ranking character, does actively police others according to conservative beliefs, lacking the tact and kindness associated with emphasized and hegemonic femininity. The Bingley sisters represent complex rank-based policing, as they strive to meet hegemonic ideals despite their new money status and lack of land, using materialism to assert their social standing. iii The study underscores the importance of considering both rank and social class as intersectional influences on femininity. This perspective highlights the matrix of domination when analyzing female hierarchies in Austen's work, revealing how characters seek to attain or reject hegemonic feminine status. The thesis argues that Austen's nuanced characters challenge the notion of a universal femininity by illustrating the fluidity of gender roles and the unique pressures each character faces.\n",
